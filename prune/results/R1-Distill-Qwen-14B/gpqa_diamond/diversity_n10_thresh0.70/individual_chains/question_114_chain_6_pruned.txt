Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), resulting in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A to D, each giving possible reagents A and B.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. So in the first reaction, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh right, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions where the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but when NaCN is added to a ketone, that's a nucleophilic addition. So the product would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ion, adding the CN group to the carbonyl carbon and the OH group to the adjacent (alpha) carbon.

So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. How does that happen? The ketone reacts with NaCN in a basic solution, perhaps using something like aqueous NaCN. But wait,
