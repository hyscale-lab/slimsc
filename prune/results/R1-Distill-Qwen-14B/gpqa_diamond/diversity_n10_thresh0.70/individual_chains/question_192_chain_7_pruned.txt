Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. There's a spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center; its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. 

Wait, and the conductor is uncharged initially. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so point P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, what's the setup here. I remember that when a conductor has a cavity, the charges inside the cavity influence the charges on the conductor's inner surface. But since the conductor itself was uncharged initially, the inner surface must develop a charge. Let me think: the conductor is neutral, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces should balance any enclosed charge.

Wait, so when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance that. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface's -q induces the outer surface's +q.

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct that. The conductor is uncharged, so the net charge is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface charge is -q, and the outer surface must then have +q to balance, because the total conductor is neutral. So the conductor's net charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. 

But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so its total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q induced, and the outer surface must have +q because the conductor as a whole is neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q. 

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when you're outside a conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because of the shell theorem. So the electric field outside a spherical shell is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but what about the charge inside the cavity? Because the cavity's charge +q is inside the conductor, so its field outside the conductor (like point P) is as if it's at the center. But wait, no, the field outside the conductor is just due to the outer charges, which is +q. Because the inner charges (the induced -q on the inner surface) are inside the conductor and don't affect the outside field.

So, the electric field at point P is the same as
