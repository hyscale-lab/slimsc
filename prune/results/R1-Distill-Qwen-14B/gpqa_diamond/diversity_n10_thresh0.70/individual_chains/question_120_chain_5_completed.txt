Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the same number of stars in any given volume of space, right? So the density is uniform. Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So larger parallax means closer stars.

Wait, parallax formula. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let me think about this in terms of volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume depends on the volume itself.

If I'm looking at a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, I can think of this as a shell in space. The corresponding distances would be from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx). Wait, no, because d is 1/plx. Hmm, wait, let me clarify. If plx is small, say 0.01 arcsec, then d is 100 parsecs. If plx increases, d decreases.

So the range in parallax is dplx, but how does that translate into a range in distance? Let's say plx changes by dplx. Then the distance changes by dd. Let me express d in terms of plx: d = 1 / plx. So dd = - (1 / plx²) * dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases.

But I'm more interested in the volume of the spherical shell between d = 1/plx and d = 1/(plx + dplx). The volume of a spherical shell is 4π/3 ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small d, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Wait, in the question, it's a range of plx, so maybe we can model it as a thin shell.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of stars in a given range of parallax and how that relates to distance. Since the number density of stars is uniform, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume.

So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * Volume, where n is the number density, which is constant.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So N = 4π n d² dd.

But we want it in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the volume in terms of plx.

Let's substitute d = 1/plx into the volume expression. So Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 ( - (1/plx²) dplx ) ) = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but the negative sign here indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a range of plx, perhaps we can take the absolute value.

So Volume ≈ 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the substitution.

Let me be precise. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, Volume = 4π ( (1/plx) )² * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

But the negative sign just tells us the shell is getting smaller as plx increases, but for the number of stars, we take the positive value.

So Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx) ) → 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, wait, is that correct? Wait, (1/plx)^2 is 1/plx². Then the dd is ( - 1/plx² ) dplx. So the volume becomes 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx² * dplx). So that's 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

But the number of stars in that volume is N = n * Volume. Since n is uniform, N = n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx (dplx) would be N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are given as options about the dependence on plx. So the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. Option B is 1/plx^2, etc.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, because for a thin shell, the volume is 4π d² dd. But the shell in plx is a range dplx. So the shell in plx is dplx, but how does that translate to the shell in distance?

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: The number of stars in a range of distances from d to d + dd is 4π d² dd * n, where n is the number density.

But d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

So the change in plx, dplx, is (d plx) = - (1/d²) dd.

So dd = - d² dplx.

Substituting into the number of stars:

N = 4 π d² (dd) n = 4 π d² (-d² dplx) n = -4 π d^4 n dplx.

But N is a positive quantity, so take absolute value.

So N = 4 π d^4 n dplx.

But d = 1/plx → d^4 = 1/plx^4.

So N = 4 π (1/plx^4) n dplx.

So the number of stars per unit dplx is 4 π n (1/plx^4). Thus, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So on the graph, as plx increases (moving to more distant stars), the number per unit plx drops as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density of stars. The volume of a spherical shell is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
N = n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)), we divide \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \):

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax.

From the given options:

- **A) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \):** Correct, as derived above.
- **B) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
