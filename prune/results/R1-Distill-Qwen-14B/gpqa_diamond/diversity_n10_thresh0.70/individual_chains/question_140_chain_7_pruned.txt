Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. 

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm. I think I'll need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's start by listing possible candidates for each.

First, looking at gas W: same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule must be of an element where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. The common gases are probably H2, CO2, O2, NH3, but wait, H2 would have 1 proton and 1 neutron per H atom. Wait, but H can be isotopes like protium, deuterium. So if W is H2, each H has 1 proton. Then the neutrons would be 1 each if they are deuterium, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe another molecule. Wait, let's think of diatomic molecules where the atoms have equal protons and neutrons.

Another possibility is O2. Oxygen has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. So if the gas is O2, each molecule has two O atoms. Each O has 8 protons, and the number of neutrons would be 8 (since oxygen-16 has 8 neutrons, 8 protons). So O2 would fit because each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. That makes the molecule O2. So W is O2?

But wait, the reaction is between X and Y. Y is a liquid. What liquids react violently with certain substances to produce O2? Maybe Y is water, H2O, as a liquid. But X reacts with water to produce O2? Or perhaps another liquid.

Wait, another possibility for gas W could be NH3. But NH3 has 1 N and 3 H atoms. Nitrogen has 7 protons, and each H has 1. So the molecule would have 7 + 1*3 = 10 protons and 7 + 0 (since H has no neutrons in protium) or maybe 1 each if they are deuterium. Not sure if that's a good fit.

Wait, maybe W is H2. Because each H atom in H2 has 1 proton. So if each H has 1 neutron (like deuterium), then each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule H2 would have two atoms, each with 1 proton and
