Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. It says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They observe the star's brightness variations due to rotation, which could look like an exoplanet transit. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is ΔF ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2, right? Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the spots cause brightness variations because as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Each spot is cooler, so when they're on the visible side, they make the star appear dimmer. But when the star is not spotted, a planet would also cause a dip.

So the question is, what planet radius would give the same change in brightness as the spots do.

First, I think I need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the planet's effect and solve for R_planet / R_star.

Let me break it down step by step.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So R_star = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%—so that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots.

So each hemisphere is roughly a spherical cap. The total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So each spot covers 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, no: filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. If one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R²). Wait, no, the surface area of a hemisphere is 2π R²? Or is it the area of a spherical cap? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4π R². If only one hemisphere is covered with spots, that's 2π R². But the filling factor is the fraction of that hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the entire stellar surface that is covered by spots? Or just the hemisphere? The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is
