Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when I measure the position, the particles aren't found for x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3, right? Or maybe it's non-zero only there.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I'm trying to remember my wave mechanics. Oh right, the wave function must be a solution to the Schrödinger equation. But maybe this is a simple potential problem. Since the wave function is given, perhaps it's an eigenstate of some potential.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function is zero outside that region, or maybe it's non-zero only there. So the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that might not make sense. Oh wait, no, the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the wave function would have both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have real and imaginary parts, but when you square it (or modulus squared), that gives the probability density. So I think the modulus squared should integrate to 1, as it's normalized.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means that the wave function is zero outside that range. But wait, according to the given wave function, when x is less than 1, say x=0.5, then 1+x is 1.5, so sqrt(1+x) is sqrt(1.5) which is about 1.225. So a divided by that is a real number. But the problem states that the wave function is zero outside x<1 and x>3. So perhaps the given expression is only valid within x=1 to x=3, and it's zero elsewhere. So the given wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. But the question is about finding the value of 'a' so that the wave function is normalized.

Wait, normalization. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the wave function is zero outside that interval, the integral from -infinity to infinity would just be the integral from 1 to 3.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that seems complex. Let me compute the modulus squared.

|ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]², because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait, maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) multiplied by e^(-i something), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is a constant, but that would be unusual. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the expression. Let me re-read the question.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, so it's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + [ (-0.5) i ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually expressed as a function of x, possibly complex. The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]².

So in this case, Re(ψ(x)) = a/(sqrt(1+x)), Im(ψ(x)) = -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that seems a bit odd because the imaginary part is a constant. But okay, perhaps it's correct.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be 1, because the wave function is zero elsewhere, and it's normalized.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute the first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but did I miss something? Let me check the math again.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Integral from 1 to3 is [ a² ln(1+x) from 1 to3 ] + [0.25*(3-1)].

Which is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) + 0.5.

ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a²= 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and it must be normalized, meaning the integral of the modulus squared of the wave function over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

### First Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right)
\]

Using the property \( \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \), this simplifies to:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)
This is straightforward:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( a \) is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
