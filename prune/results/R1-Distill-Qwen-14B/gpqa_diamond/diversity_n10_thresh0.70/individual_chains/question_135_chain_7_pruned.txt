Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a bosonic field X that's interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think that's a Yukawa interaction term. Right, Yukawa couplings are between a scalar field and fermions, so this makes sense. The boson X is the one we're focusing on.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because each fermion would take at least half the mass of the parent particle. So, the maximum fermion mass allowed would be M_X / 2, which is 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the known fermions and their masses.

The fermions are quarks and leptons. Let's list them:

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But neutrinos are massless (or very light, but negligible), so they won't contribute. The charged leptons' masses: electron is about 0.511 MeV (much less than 3 GeV), muon is about 105.7 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses (current masses):

Up: ~2 MeV
Down: ~4-5 MeV
Strange: ~100 MeV
Charm: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

Wait, so let's calculate M_X / 2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass m where 2m ≤ 6 GeV. Wait, no, wait. When a boson of mass M decays into two particles of mass m, each must be less than M/2. So each fermion mass must be less than or equal to M/2. So for X, M=6 GeV, so m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be produced.

So let's see which fermions are lighter than 3 GeV.

Lepton side:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → yes.
Muon: 105.7 MeV → yes.
Tau: 1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78 < 3.
Neutrinos: negligible, so they can be considered as 0. So X can decay into tau pairs, mu pairs, electron pairs.

Quark side:

Up: 2 MeV → yes.
Down: ~5 MeV → yes.
Strange: ~100 MeV → yes.
Charm: ~1.5 GeV → yes, because 1.5 <3.
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5>3. So bottom is out.
Top: 173 GeV → way too heavy, so no.

So for quarks, up, down, strange, charm are allowed. But wait, the problem is about the possible decay products. However, in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with certain fermions. Wait, so the interaction term is -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the fermion field ψ_f must be the same as the fermion in the decay.

Wait, the X couples to each fermion f
