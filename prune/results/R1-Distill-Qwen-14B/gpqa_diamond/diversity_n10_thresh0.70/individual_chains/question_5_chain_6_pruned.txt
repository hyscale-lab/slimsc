Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, okay, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states when the observable is measured.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,-i], second row [i,0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1,0; 0,-1].

Wait, the question is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, when you have an operator along a direction, you can express it as a combination of the Pauli matrices. So the operator P for direction n = (nx, 0, nz) would be something like P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), since the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but wait, the operator P given here is for a muon, but I think that's just the particle, not affecting the calculation. So the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1.

So the operator along direction n is P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Let me write that out.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z are given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], and so on.

So substituting, P = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[
