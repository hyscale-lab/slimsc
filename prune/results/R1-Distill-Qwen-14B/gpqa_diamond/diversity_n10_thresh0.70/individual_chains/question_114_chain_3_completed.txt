Okay, I need to figure out the correct reagents for these two reactions. Let me go through each step carefully.

So, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product here is a nitrile. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution?

Wait, no, butan-2-one plus NaCN. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, so the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me look at that structure. The molecule has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile on the same carbon. So, maybe the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl, then something happens.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin is when a ketone (or aldehyde) reacts with HCN to form a compound with both OH and CN groups on the same carbon. So in this case, maybe the reagent is HCN. But the question says NaCN and reagent A. Oh wait, maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst. Because I think HCN is a weak acid, but if you have NaCN and a strong acid, perhaps it can help generate the necessary conditions.

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ (which is option A for reagent A) might be the setup. So, the reaction could be acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone. The H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then CN- attacks. Then water would come in, leading to tautomerism or something. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw this out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding CN, maybe it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via another mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Stephen reduction? But that usually involves ketones and CN- with a reducing agent. Wait, no, Stephen's reduction uses a ketone and HCN in presence of a base to form a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group. Or maybe it's just the formation of the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. The starting ketone is four carbons (butan-2-one), and the product is five carbons? Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons (butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's four carbons in total, but the carbonyl is in position 2). So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is CH2(C(OH)CN)(CH2CH3?), wait maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl is replaced by CN, but that's not possible here because ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution without some activation, like in a Grignard reaction, but that's more substitution. Wait, but NaCN is a cyanide source.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that usually forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Hmm, no, not that either.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN. But in ketones, the carbonyl is a C=O. Replacing O with CN would require a very strong nucleophile. I'm not sure if that's feasible under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination, but that might form an enone or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but with CN. Wait, but Grignard reagents are strong bases, and NaCN is a cyanide ion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-step reaction. First, NaCN adds to the ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Then, in presence of an acid, it might form the nitrile. Wait, no, the product is an alcohol with a nitrile group, so that would make sense for the cyanohydrin.

Wait, in cyanohydrin formation, the ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-) in presence of an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+. So, if reagent A is H3O+, that would make sense. So the first step would be adding H3O+ as catalyst, along with NaCN (which provides CN-).

So for reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ (so A is H3O+), which would form the cyanohydrin product, which matches the structure given.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, in this step, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. How does that happen?

I know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form amides or carboxylic acids. The reaction conditions determine the product. For example, under strong acidic conditions (like H2SO4 and heat), nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Under basic conditions (like NaOH and heat), they form sodium salts of carboxylic acids, which can be acidified to the acid.

Looking at the reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So B is the catalyst. The starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

So, what reagent would cause this hydrolysis? Acidic conditions are likely. So B could be HCl, H2SO4, or another strong acid. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, possible reagents for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, but for nitrile hydrolysis to acid, you usually need a strong acid as a catalyst. So, HCl or H2SO4 would make sense. But the options given for B are HCl (option A) and CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, so if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions. Alternatively, if B is something else, maybe a base, but since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's more likely to be acidic.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles can use a mixture of H2O and a strong acid. So, perhaps reagent B is HCl.

Looking back at the options, options A and C have B as HCl. So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

So putting it together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (so options A or B or C or D, but looking at options, A is H3O+ and B is HCl in option A).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.
Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH.
Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl.
Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH.

Wait, so if the first reaction requires H3O+ as A, then options A, B are possible.

So for reaction 1: A is H3O+.

Reaction 2: Reagent B is HCl. So looking for options where B is HCl. So options A and C.

But option A's B is HCl, and A's A is H3O+. So that would fit: first reaction uses H3O+, second uses HCl.

But wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B plus H2O. So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. So, under acidic conditions, perhaps HCl is added as a catalyst.

So, the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ (for the first reaction), B=HCl (for the second).

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's being treated with B and H2O to form a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires a strong acid, like HCl, then B would be HCl, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis using a different method. For example, if the nitrile is in a molecule with a hydroxyl group, maybe a different condition is needed.

Wait, but the presence of the hydroxyl group might not interfere. The main thing is the conversion of CN to COOH.

Therefore, selecting reagent B as HCl would be suitable for this hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together, the first reagent (A) should be H3O+ (so options A or B or E?), and the second (B) should be HCl (so options A or C).

So between the options, option A has A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking again at the products: in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the second reaction's product is a butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converted into a COOH.

So the second reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid, which requires hydrolysis.

In that case, the conditions are acidic hydrolysis. So the reagent would be HCl in H2O, perhaps under reflux. So B is HCl.

Thus, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: what if the first reaction uses a different reagent, like NaHSO3?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What reaction does that cause? I think bisulfite is used in the Markovnikov addition to alkenes, but for ketones, perhaps it's used for something else.

Alternatively, maybe for the first reaction, it's a different mechanism. Let's think again.

Butan-2-one plus NaCN and a reagent. If the reagent is NaHSO3, perhaps it's a different kind of addition. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but if it's a substitution, the ketone's O would be replaced by CN-. But that would require a good leaving group, which the carbonyl isn't. So maybe not substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but that's more for amides or similar.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong in the first reaction. Maybe the reagent A is NaHSO3, acting as a catalyst for a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's the formation of a nitrile via a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN. But that's not typical without something like a Grignard or organometallic reagent.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a Robinson annulation? No, that's more for conjugated additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the ketone is converted into a nitrile. But that seems unlikely without a strong base or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is using a cyanide as a nucleophile under acidic conditions. So, under acidic conditions, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic, and CN- attacks to form the cyanohydrin.

So in that case, reagent A is H3O+ (acid). So option A (H3O+) is correct for A.

Then for the second reaction, B must be HCl. So the correct option is A.

But wait, let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a more complex molecule, but the reaction is about converting the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

So, for this hydrolysis, most likely, HCl in water is used. So B is HCl.

So putting it all together, the correct options are A = H3O+, B = HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the CN⁻ ion (from NaCN) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. To facilitate this, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) is the suitable reagent for this step.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B and water. This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, where the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). Acidic hydrolysis is typically used for this transformation, and HCl (option A) is a suitable reagent to catalyze this reaction.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not a strong enough acid for efficient nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
