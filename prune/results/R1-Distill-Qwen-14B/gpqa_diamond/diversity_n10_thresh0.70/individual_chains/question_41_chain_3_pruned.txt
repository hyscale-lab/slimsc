Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in glass when the glass is moving. Hmm, let me see. I remember from my classes that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. Oh right, the index of refraction is involved here. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to its speed in the medium (v_medium). So, normally, the speed of light in the glass would be c/n. But wait, in this problem, the glass itself is moving. That complicates things because of relativity maybe?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving. Hmm, so I think I need to consider how the speed of light transforms when the medium itself is moving.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. But wait, wait. The problem says the speed of light in the glass is what's being asked. Or is it the speed relative to the observer?

Wait, the question is: What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? So I think I need to find the speed of the light beam as observed in the lab frame, considering that the glass is moving.

Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n (since the speed in the medium is c divided by the refractive index). But when the glass is moving, we need to use the velocity addition formula from relativity. Oh wait, but wait. Does the index of refraction affect this? Because in a medium moving at velocity v, the light's speed might change due to both the medium's motion and the medium's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about this in terms of reference frames. Let me consider the glass as the moving frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because velocities don't just add up normally when you switch frames.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (glass frame), and u' is its velocity in the lab frame.
