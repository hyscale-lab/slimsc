Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I guess I don't have to worry about hydrolysis or anything like that. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²- maybe? Because EDTA is usually a hexadentate ligand, and when it complexes with Ca²+, the overall charge would be... Let me see, Ca²+ has +2 charge, and EDTA is Y^4- in the complex. So CaY²- would have a charge of 0? Or wait, no. Wait, Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would combine as CaY²- because 2+ + 4- gives 2-, so CaY²- has a charge of -2. Oh, but the solution is neutral, so maybe the counterions aren't important here.

The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. But the question is about the free calcium ion concentration. So because the complex dissociates, but because the formation constant is so large, the dissociation would be minimal, right?

Wait, formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. Oh wait, the notation is KCa-EDTA. So I think Kf is the formation constant for the complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²-.

The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So, Kf is a very large number, meaning the reaction favors the product, so most of the Ca²+ and EDTA are tied up in the complex. But in this case, the solution is already the complex, and we're assuming the pH is ideal, so we can probably neglect any other equilibria.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, and that's the only species present, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But in reality, a tiny amount of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So, the concentration of Ca²+ will be very small.

So, let's model this. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be x, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We know that [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M minus the amount dissociated. But because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So, 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02. So,

Kf ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Rearranging,

x² = 0.02 / Kf

So,

x = sqrt(0.02 / Kf)

Plugging in Kf=5e10,

x = sqrt(0.02 / (5e10)).

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x = sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = sqrt( (2/(5e12)) ) = sqrt(4e-13) ??? Wait, wait, let me compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, 5e10 is 5 x
