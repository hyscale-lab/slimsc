Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

First, I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Or wait, no, 1 and 3 positions are across each other in the adamantane structure, which is a bit like a cubane but more diamond-like. Hmm.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. In such conditions, for dibromides, I think an elimination reaction might happen, especially if it's heated. Dehydrohalogenation, maybe forming an alkene. But wait, with two bromines, could it form a diene or a bridged structure?

Wait, but considering adamantane's structure. If you have 1 and 3 dibromines, and you eliminate HBr, perhaps the two adjacent carbons (if they're connected) would form a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. Let me think: the adamantane molecule has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, forming a diamond lattice. So the 1 and 3 positions are on opposite faces, I think. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but maybe not directly. Wait, no, elimination would require the adjacent H and Br. Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on different parts of the adamantane structure. Maybe each Br is on a different bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH causes a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a double bond. But in adamantane derivatives, that might form a bridge or something else. Wait, maybe it
