Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, this is a spin-½ system, I think. 

The first part of the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, right. Because for i≠j, the elements are non-zero. So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

The second part is to find the average value of that operator.

So I think the steps are:

1. Normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to those coefficients, so we need to find the normalization factor.

2. Find the eigenstates of the operator A because the measurement probabilities correspond to the eigenstates of the operator.

3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach could be to compute the expectation
