Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me take it step by step.

So, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. The main parts I can see are a cyclohexane ring, a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane, and a formyl group (the aldehyde part).

Wait, wait. The structure is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Oh, wait, no. Let me parse that name again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a hydroxy group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached at position 1. And then, there's a carbaldehyde group, so another cyclohexane ring with a formyl group.

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the entire substituent is on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (so a cyclohexane ring with a -CO-CHO group?) Wait, no, wait, carbaldehyde is R-CHO. So the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group attached. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group where one hydrogen is replaced by an OH and another by a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine it.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethyn
