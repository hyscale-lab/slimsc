Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when dealing with excitation in stars, we often use the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, that's the one that relates the population of different energy levels in a gas to temperature.

So the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the number of atoms in a higher energy level (let's say level 2) compared to a lower one (level 1) is twice as much for star_1 than star_2. I think the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. That's ΔE. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 (n21/n11 = 2), and for star_2, it's 1 (n22/n12 = 1, assuming same lower level). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for star_1, the number in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is (n2/n1) = 2, and for star_2, it's (n2/n1) = 1? Or am I getting this reversed?

Wait, no, no. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio for star_1 is (n2/n1) = 2, and for star_2, it's (n2/n1) = 1. Because star_2 has half as many excited atoms as star_1. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So if star_1's ratio is 2, and star_2's is 1, but wait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. Let me re-read: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, so n2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is n2/n1 for each star.

So for star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2. For star_2, n2_2 / n1_2 = 1. But wait, assuming that the lower energy level population is the same for both stars? Or is it that the same energy levels are being considered, so n1 is same in both? Or perhaps the lower level is the same. Wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars, 1.38e-23 J.

So the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star_1: (n2_1 / n1_1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: (n2_2 / n1_2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But wait, the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2*(n2_2 / n1_2) ?

Wait no, the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2's ratio. Because the atoms are twice as excited. So, (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2).

So that gives:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me write that equation down. Let me set x = ΔE/(k). Then, the equation becomes exp(-x/T1) = 2 exp(-x/T2).

Taking natural log on both sides: -x/T1 = ln(2) - x/T2

Rearranging: x (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But wait, x is ΔE/(k), so:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let's go back. Let me write the two equations:

Equation 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2)

Equation 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 1 ?

Wait, wait. No, because for star_2, the ratio is n2_2/n1_2. But if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's ratio, then equation for star_1 is:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, but that would make equation 1: exp(-x/T1) = 2 exp(-x/T2), where x is ΔE/(k). So, let's take natural logs of both sides:

ln(exp(-x/T1)) = ln(2 exp(-x/T2)).

Which simplifies to:

- x/T1 = ln(2) - x/T2.

Let me rearrange this:

- x/T1 + x/T2 = ln(2)

x (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But x is ΔE/(k), so:

(ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the question is about the relation between T1 and T2. Let's see what's given. We know ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. But in the options, the equation is given in terms of T1 and T2, and the question is which equation involving ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

So from our equation, the equation is:

(ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back, we have:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm. But looking at the options, they are in terms of ln(2) equals some expression with T1 and T2. So I need to find which option matches.

Wait, let me write the equation:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the options are equations where ln(2) is equal to some expression involving T1 and T2. So to get ln(2) on the right side, perhaps ΔE/(k) is a known value.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermal Equilibrium. So the Boltzmann equation applies. But in the options, the equations don't have any constants like ΔE or k. So perhaps we can assume that (ΔE/(k)) is a certain value, but in the problem, it's given, but the options don't include it. Hmmm. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars.

So for star_1: (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2.

Wait, no, because the problem states that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n21/n11) = 2 * (n22/n12).

But (n22/n12) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So the equation is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Same as before.

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, rearranged:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

But the options have expressions without ΔE or k. So perhaps this is not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be manipulated into another form.

Wait, maybe let me think about the ratio of the two equations.

We have for the two stars:

n21/n11 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * n22/n12 = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Dividing both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking natural logarithm:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, same as before.

So, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * (ΔE/(k)) ) ] / (T1 T2)

But the question is about which equation for T1 and T2 is correct, and the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So this suggests I might have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of the two temperatures. Let me think about considering the two equations:

n21/n11 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (n22/n12) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So, if I take the ratio (n21/n11) / (n22/n12) = 2.

Which means exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) = 2.

Wait, because (n21/n11) = exp(-x/T1) and (n22/n12)=exp(-x/T2), so their ratio is exp( x (1/T2 - 1/T1) )=2.

Which again leads to x (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2), where x=ΔE/(k).

So, perhaps I can write that as:

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, the options don't include any constants like ΔE or k. So perhaps the problem expects us to eliminate ΔE/(k) somehow, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of T1 and T2. Let me assume that the difference in energy is the same for both stars, but the question is about the relation between T1 and T2.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

Wait, for star_1, the ratio is 2: n2/n1 = 2.

For star_2, the ratio is 1: n2/n1 =1.

So, for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Taking ln: ln 2 = -ΔE/(k T1)

For star_2: 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln: 0 = -ΔE/(k T2) → ΔE/(k T2) = 0 → which would imply T2 approaches infinity, but that's not possible. Hmm, that can't be right because that would suggest T2 is infinite, which isn't the case.

Wait, that approach can’t be correct. Because if n2/n1=1, then exp(-ΔE/(k T2))=1 → -ΔE/(k T2) =0 → T2 is infinite. But that's impossible, so my initial approach must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Because the Boltzmann factor is n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's, then:

n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2 )

But n2_2/n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, n2_1/n1_1 = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But also, n2_1/n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which again brings me back to the same equation.

So, to write this in terms of T1 and T2, perhaps I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the problem is, the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps I'm supposed to rearrange the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without involving ΔE and k.

Wait, but in the options, the equations are ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, that's exactly what the equation says, except for the factor of ΔE/(k). So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, which isn't the case.

Wait, because ΔE/(k) is a value. Let me calculate what it is. ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K, exactly. Oh! So ΔE is exactly 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k. So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So, substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K ) * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Which matches exactly. So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1, the ratio of excited to ground state atoms is twice that of star_2. Thus:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rearranging \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), the ratio \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation.
