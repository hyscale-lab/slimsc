Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, I think it's supposed to be something like L = -λ_f ψ† (something with X) ψ. Wait, maybe it's more like a Yukawa coupling term. Typically, the Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So in this case, the interaction would be between the fermion ψ and the boson X, mediated by this coupling.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into. Remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would carry away some energy, and the minimum energy needed is when they are at rest, each with mass m. So, M_X ≥ 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

Wait, but what fermions are we talking about here? The Lagrangian term given implies which fermions X can interact with. Because the interaction term determines which particles are involved.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as -λ_f f ψ̄ (something) ψ_f. Wait, maybe that's a typo, but I think in the problem statement, the interaction is given for each fermion species f. So the boson X couples to each fermion f, and the coupling is λ_f.

So for each fermion f, X can decay into f and f-bar. But wait, only if the coupling exists. So the allowed decay channels depend on which fermions the X couples to.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions
