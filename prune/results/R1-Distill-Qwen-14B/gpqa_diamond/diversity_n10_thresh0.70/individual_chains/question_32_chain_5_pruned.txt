Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6, I think. So the nucleus is Li-6, meaning it's a heavy ion with atomic number 3 and mass number 6.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy is significantly higher than their rest mass energy. So I need to calculate the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes it's just the total energy. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy (rest plus kinetic)? I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to think. Oh wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy imparted to each beam. But sometimes, they refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the formula and see.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So first, I should find the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's calculate that. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me do that calculation properly.

Wait: 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 =
