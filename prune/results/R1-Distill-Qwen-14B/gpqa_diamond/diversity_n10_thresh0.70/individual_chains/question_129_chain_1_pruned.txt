Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. Let's see what each step entails and how the compounds are related.

First, the reaction sequence:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are some hints provided. Let's look at them.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on ylides but I remember they're used in alkylation. Oh right, Wittig reactions! So A must be an aldehyde or ketone because Wittig reagents react with them to form alkenes. So the product is an alkene, which suggests that A is a carbonyl compound.

Looking at the product from the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me imagine the structure. So cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is like a CH2-C(CH3)- group attached as a double bond. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, so it's a substituted vinyl group attached to the ring.

Hmm, so the Wittig reaction between A and the ylide gives an alkene. The ylide is probably the one providing the propan-2-ylidene part. Wait, no, the ylide would have the double bond. Wait, the ylide would have a carbonyl group in A. So the product comes from A's carbonyl reacting with the ylide.

Wait, let me think again. The ylide would have a structure like PPh3+=CH-... or something similar. When it reacts with a carbonyl (like an aldehyde or ketone), it forms an alkene. So, the structure of the product would be the R group from the carbonyl attached to the new double bond.

Wait, in the product, the cyclopentane has a substituent at position 4 which is propan-2-ylidene. So the ylide must have been something like (CH3)2C=PH3+ etc. So when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl (from compound A) would attack the ylide. Let me imagine that.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because in the product, the substituents are on the cyclopentane ring. So if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, reacting with a Wittig reagent would form the double bond.

Wait, let me try to draw this mentally. Suppose A is 4-methylcyclopentan-1-one. Then, the carb
