Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Parallax... I remember that parallax is how we measure distances to stars. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/distance. Wait, no, actually, d = 1/plx. Yeah, that's right.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a volume doesn't depend on how far you go. So for example, in the universe, if stars are spread out evenly, the number in a cubic parsec would be the same whether it's near us or far away.

But wait, when we observe stars, their distribution in terms of parallax might not be uniform because of the way distance relates to parallax. So how does the number of stars per unit parallax change with plx?

Hmm. Let's model this. Let's imagine that stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density n is constant. So in a volume V, number of stars is n * V.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we need to relate the number of stars in a certain parallax range to the parallax itself.

Wait, parallax is inversely related to distance. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d relates to d and plx.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this translate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dr is the change in distance, which would relate to the change in parallax. Let's find dr in terms of plx.

Differentiating both sides, d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases (distance decreases), but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe the sign isn't crucial here; we can take absolute values.

So the number of stars
