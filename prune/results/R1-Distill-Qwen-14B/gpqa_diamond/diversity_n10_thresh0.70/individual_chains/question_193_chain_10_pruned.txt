Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax and distance... I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), so distance d is 1 / plx. That makes sense. 

So the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1 / plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would change things. Let me write that down. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5, which is the same as d^5. Wait, no, actually 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, the question isn't just asking about the number of stars at a certain distance, but how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, that's the differential. So they want dN/dr, the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. 

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to d. So N = k * d^5 (where k is some constant). Taking the derivative, dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. 

But wait, the options are given in terms of r. Oh, right, because the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So if r is the distance, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with r^4. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So that's the answer. 

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another approach: parallax plx is 1/d. So N = C / plx^5 = C d^5. So as d increases, N increases with the fifth power. But the question is about how the number changes as you go
