Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds to metal ions, forming a complex. The question says the concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I think the formation of the complex can be represented by the equation: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant, K, is given, which is 5x10^10. The problem is about finding [Ca²+] when the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

I recall that the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, in solution, the free EDTA might be present in a form with different charges, but I think in the formation constant, it's usually the fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-, that's involved.

Wait, but sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. The question says the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about that. So under ideal conditions, the EDTA is in the right form to bind Ca²+.

Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we'll assume that all the EDTA is in the complex form because the K is so large. Wait, K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the complex is very stable. That means that almost all the EDTA and Ca²+ will be tied up in the complex. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA must be very low.

Let me think about the expression. Let’s let s be the concentration of free Ca²+ (which is what we're trying to find). Then, since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be s as well. Because each mole of complex releases one mole of each.

So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(s
