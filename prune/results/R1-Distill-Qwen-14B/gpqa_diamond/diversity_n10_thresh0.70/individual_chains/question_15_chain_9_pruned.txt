Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transiting planets are easier to detect when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But I'm not exactly sure about all the factors that influence the probability. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star since it has a shorter period.

Both have circular orbits, which simplifies things since eccentricity isn't a factor here. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius? That might mean something about their densities or evolutionary stages. Hmm, not sure if that matters for transit probability directly.

I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh, right, the formula for the probability. I remember it's something like (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by (something else). Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius? Or perhaps it's the impact parameter and how likely the planet's path will cross our line of sight.

Wait, I think
