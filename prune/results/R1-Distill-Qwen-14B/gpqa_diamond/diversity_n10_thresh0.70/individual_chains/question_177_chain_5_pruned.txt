Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies and want to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² times T⁴.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The wavelength of maximum emission, I think, is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. Oh, that's a key point. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they found that the peaks (wavelengths) are the same, so same T. So then, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both, L is proportional to R².

But wait, the question says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 = (R1²) * T^4, L2 = (R2²) * T^4. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio would be 2.25 times. But wait, that's if T is the same. But wait, the problem gives radial velocities. How does that affect the situation?

Wait
