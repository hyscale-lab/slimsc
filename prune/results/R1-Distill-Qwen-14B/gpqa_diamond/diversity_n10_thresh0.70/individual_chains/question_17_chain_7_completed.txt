Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. And we're supposed to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is likely [CaY]^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The stability constant, K, is the formation constant, Kf, for the complex.

So, the formation constant Kf is given by the equation: Kf = [CaY²−] / ([Ca²+][Y^4−]). But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

I think the solution assumes that the EDTA is in excess, but wait, no—the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, which probably means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4−) are in a 1:1 ratio. So, for every mole of CaY²−, there's one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the solution is made by exactly neutralizing the EDTA with Ca²+?

Wait, another approach: the reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−. The formation constant Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

In a solution where all the Ca²+ is complexed, the amount of free Ca²+ and Y^4− would be determined by Kf. But wait, if the solution is at stoichiometric point, which I'm a bit confused about. Or perhaps, it's just that the solution is prepared by adding exactly the right amount of EDTA to form the complex without any excess. So, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are the same, and they form the complex.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M in the CaY²− complex, then assuming that the solution is in equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− can be found using Kf.

But wait, let me think. Let's denote the concentration of CaY²− as 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x, and free EDTA (Y^4−) be y. But I think in this scenario, since the complex is formed, we can set up the equation based on Kf.

Wait, another thing: the problem says that the solution is "stoichiometric." Does that mean that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal at the beginning, so that all the Ca²+ is complexed? Or does it mean that the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts, so that they form the complex?

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M. But when they form the complex, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, leaving some free Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Wait, no. Wait, think again. If the solution is 0.02 M in the CaY²− complex, that's the total concentration of the complex. But in reality, some of the Ca²+ and EDTA might dissociate, but since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation would be negligible. Wait, but Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ and Y^4− would be very low.

Wait, but if the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in equal amounts, then the initial concentrations before complexation would be [Ca²+] = 0.02 M and [EDTA] = 0.02 M. Then, they form the complex, so [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. But wait, that would imply that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are complexed. But that can't be right because some would remain free.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding 0.02 M CaY²−, which dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−, but due to the high Kf, the dissociation is minimal.

So, assuming that the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] is x, [Y^4−] is y. Then, according to the formation constant:

Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x * y).

But wait, in a stoichiometric solution, perhaps the amount of Ca²+ plus the complex is equal to the initial Ca²+ concentration. Wait, maybe the stoichiometric point is when [Ca²+] = [Y^4−], because they react 1:1. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the total concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are both 0.02 M. So, [Ca²+] + [CaY²−] = 0.02, and same for EDTA. But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The rest is the free ions.

The formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ). So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y), where x is [Ca²+] and y is [Y^4−].

But what's the relationship between x and y? Well, considering that each mole of CaY²− dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−, but in reality, the dissociation is minimal because Kf is large.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption is that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are in the complex form. So, the free concentrations are negligible. But that can't be true because the question is asking for the free Ca²+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as:

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

[Ca²+] = x.

[Y^4−] = y.

The formation constant equation is:

Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x y).

But another equation comes from the conservation of EDTA. The total EDTA concentration is [Y^4−] + [CaY²−] = (y + 0.02) = initial [EDTA], let's call it C_EDTA.

Similarly, the total Ca²+ is [Ca²+] + [CaY²−] = x + 0.02 = initial [Ca²+], let's call it C_Ca.

But without knowing the initial concentrations or the ratio, perhaps we can make an assumption that the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in equal amounts, so that all of the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. Wait, but then the initial concentrations would be 0.02 M each, but some would form the complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of CaY²−, which then dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−, but this dissociation is minimal because Kf is large.

Wait, but if the complex dissociates, then:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−.

The formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

But if at equilibrium, [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x, because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Wait, assuming that [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x.

So, substituting:

Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So, x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 2e-2, 5e-3, 6.3e-7, 1e-2.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is x.

So, initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02, and at equilibrium, it dissociates into x of Ca²+ and x of Y^4−.

So, [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x.

Wait, but if Kf is 5e10, which is large, x would be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf ≈ 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x).

So, x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 → x ≈ sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in equal concentrations, leading to a complex formation. So, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− are both 0.02 M, and the complex forms with a concentration of 0.02 M. But that can't be because the sum of Ca²+ and complex would be 0.02 + 0.02 = 0.04 M, which is more than the initial.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again.

If the solution is 0.02 M in the CaY²− complex, and assuming that the dissociation is negligible, then the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− would each be x. So,

Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

So, x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) = approx 4.47e-6 M.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 6.3e-7. Wait, that's much smaller. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Then, x squared is 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13, sqrt is 2 *10^-6.5 → which is approximately 6.3e-7.

Ah! Because 10^-6.5 is sqrt(10^-13) = 10^(-6.5) = approx 3.16e-7. So, 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

So, x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Which matches option C.

So, the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻), we use the formation constant (Kf) for the complex, which is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{CaY}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the very large \( K_f \). Thus, the concentrations of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and free EDTA \([\text{Y}^{4-}]\) are equal at equilibrium, denoted as \( x \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
