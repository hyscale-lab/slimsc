Okay, so I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. The options are different relationships with distance, like r cubed, r squared, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs, right? So p = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Or wait, no, the formula is distance r = 1/p. So as parallax decreases, distance increases.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5), which is the same as N ∝ p^(-5). But I need to express this in terms of distance, not parallax.

Since p = 1/r, then p is inversely proportional to r. So replacing p in the equation, N ∝ (1/r)^(-5). Let me calculate that. (1/r)^-5 is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So per unit range of distance, like how many stars are there as you move a certain distance away. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of density, or maybe the number of stars per unit volume or something
