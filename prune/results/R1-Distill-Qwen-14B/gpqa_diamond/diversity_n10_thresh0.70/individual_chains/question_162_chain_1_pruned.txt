Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, and sometimes they model things like black holes or other spacetime structures. But this question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of space with constant negative curvature.

Wait, a pseudosphere usually refers to something like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in higher dimensions, maybe this metric is representing a 2-dimensional space with a certain curvature. Let me think about the form of the metric.

So, the metric is conformally flat because it's in the form (something) times (dx² + dy²). Conformally flat metrics are easier to work with because they only involve a scaling factor. The scaling factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

But wait, what's the denominator? 4 - x² - y². So the denominator is 4 minus the radius squared. If I let r² = x² + y², then the denominator is 4 - r². Hmm, so as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which means the scaling factor blows up. That suggests that the geometry has a singularity at r=2. Because as r approaches 2, the metric becomes singular, meaning the curvature becomes infinite
