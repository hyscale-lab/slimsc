Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And I need to choose the correct option from A to D, each giving a position r with three coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projection operator, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But in this case, ρ isn't just a single projection; it's a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Wait, that makes sense because it's an equal mixture of the two basis states. So this is a maximally mixed state for a qubit.

I think the density matrix for a qubit can be represented in a three-dimensional space. Oh right, because the space of 2x2 density matrices is three-dimensional. Each density matrix can be represented as a point in this space, and for qubits, it's often visualized using the Bloch sphere.

The standard representation of a qubit state on the Bloch sphere is a vector r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the vector points to the state's position on the sphere. But for a mixed state, it's more about the expectation values. Wait, but how does this apply to the density matrix?

The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is a 3-component vector. So I can expand ρ as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Given that the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. So |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, and |1⟩⟨1| is the opposite: 0 and 1. Adding them together gives a matrix that's diagonal with 1 and 1. Then multiplied by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes 1/2 and 1/2. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with [0.5, 0.5] on the diagonal.

Wait, in terms of the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, let's expand that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Now, the other terms: r_x σ_x is r_x times [[0,1],[1,0]], and similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So when we add all these terms and divide by 2, the diagonal entries will depend on σ_z.

Wait, but let me compute each component. The diagonal entries of ρ are (I/2 + (r_z σ_z)/2). Because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So (r_z σ_z)/2 is [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]]. Adding this to I/2, the diagonal becomes 0.5 + r_z/2 and 0.5 - r_z/2.

But our given ρ has both diagonal elements as 0.5. So 0.5 + r_z/2 = 0.5 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z=0. Similarly, the second diagonal element is 0.5 - r_z/2 = 0.5 → r_z=0. So r_z must be zero.

Now, what about the off-diagonal elements? In our given ρ, the off-diagonal terms are zero. Because |0⟩⟨0| has zero off-diagonal, same for |1⟩⟨1|. So the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are zero. So the off-diagonal part of ρ must be zero.

Looking back at the expansion, the off-diagonal elements come from the terms involving σ_x and σ_y. Let's compute the (1,2) element. The (1,2) element of σ_x is 1, and σ_y has (1,2) element as i. Oh wait, in the expansion, the off-diagonal terms would be (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y)/2.

So the (1,2) element of ρ is [ (r_x * 1) + (r_y * i) ) ] / 2. But our given ρ has zero off-diagonal elements. So [r_x + i r_y]/2 = 0. This implies both real and imaginary parts are zero. So r_x = 0 and r_y =0.

So putting it all together, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). Wait, but that's one of the options. Option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the point at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but I thought the maximally mixed state is at the origin, yes. Because for a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2, which corresponds to r=0. So that makes sense.

So the correct answer is C) r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the qubit is in an equal mixture of the computational basis states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\). Density matrices for qubits can be represented as points in a three-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere, where the position vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3-component vector. Expanding this, the diagonal elements of \(\rho\) depend on \(r_z\), and the off-diagonal elements depend on \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).

For the given \(\rho\), the diagonal elements are both \(0.5\), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This implies:

1. From the diagonal elements: \(0.5 + \frac{r_z}{2} = 0.5\) and \(0.5 - \frac{r_z}{2} = 0.5\), which gives \(r_z = 0\).
2. From the off-diagonal elements: The off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies that the contributions from \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) must also be zero. Thus, \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Therefore, the position vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
