Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again and think through it. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is number of stars N = 1/(plx^5). Hmm, I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Therefore, d = 1/plx.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. So I think I need to express N in terms of d and then find the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance. Wait, the question says per unit range of distance, so maybe I'm looking at the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance, or how the density changes with distance.

So starting with N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, N should be proportional to d^5, because (1/plx) is d, so (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the options are in terms of r, which is the distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, how does that translate? Let me think about it in terms of a small change in distance, dr. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r multiplied by dr. Because as you move away, the number increases or decreases based on the derivative.

So if N = k * r^5, where k is a constant, then the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) increases with r^4.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance r)?" So I think that the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer should be
