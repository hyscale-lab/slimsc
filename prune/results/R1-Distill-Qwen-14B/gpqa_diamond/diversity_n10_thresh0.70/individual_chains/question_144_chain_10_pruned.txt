Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. So the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given data?

I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy and time are connected. So Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, but wait, I might get that mixed up. Let me think, the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle at rest, the decay width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I might need to be careful with units here. Because the width Γ is usually given in energy units, and τ is in time. So yeah, Γ * τ ≈ ħ.

But wait, wait. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for decay width and lifetime is Γ = ħ / τ. Or is it τ = ħ / Γ? Let me get that right. Γ is the energy width, and τ is the lifetime. So higher Γ means a shorter lifetime, which makes sense because a particle that decays quickly has a broader width.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact formula might include a factor. I recall that for a resonance, the natural linewidth is Γ, and τ is given by τ = ħ/(Γ). So that's correct.

But wait, does this apply when the particle is moving at a certain velocity? Because the decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving and how long it lives. Oh right, because if a particle is moving quickly, it travels a longer distance before decaying.

So the mean decay path L is the product of the speed v, the lifetime τ, and possibly some relativistic factors.

Wait, but particles with high energy are moving relativistically. So their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. Oh right, time dilation. So the lifetime τ observed is τ multiplied by gamma (γ), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the total decay length would be L = v * γ * τ.

But wait, how do I get v from the given energy? The production energy is E_X =8 GeV, but the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so it's moving with some kinetic energy. Hmm, but maybe we can approximate the speed based on the energy.

Wait, since the particle is a resonance, does it have a significant lifetime? Or is it produced and decays quickly? Hmm, but the question is about the mean decay distance, so it must have a non-zero lifetime.

So first, calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ. Then, find the velocity v from the energy E. Then compute γ, the Lorentz factor.

Alternatively, since
