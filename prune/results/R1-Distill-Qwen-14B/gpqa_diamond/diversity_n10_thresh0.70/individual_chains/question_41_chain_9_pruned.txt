Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass that's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The glass has an index of refraction n. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium, like glass, is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed of light in the medium when the medium is stationary. But what if the medium is moving?

So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, so the beam is moving through the glass, which itself is moving towards the observer. But the observer is in the lab frame. So I need to consider how the motion of the glass affects the speed of light as measured in the lab.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on relative velocity here. Oh right, velocity addition in special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just naively add velocities. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So does that mean the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab, is still c? But wait, that doesn't make sense because the glass is moving.

Wait, no. Because the light is within the glass, which has an index of refraction. So normally, when the medium is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed?

Wait, maybe I can think about it with the help of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. If an object has velocity u in the frame S (the medium's frame), then in frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, the velocity u' is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So which frame is which here?

In this problem, the lab is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Wait, no. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass's velocity
