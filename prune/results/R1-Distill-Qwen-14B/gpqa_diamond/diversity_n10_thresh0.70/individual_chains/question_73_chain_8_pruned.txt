Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving in the same direction, the positive x-direction, at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just add or subtract speeds because that would exceed the speed of light, which is impossible. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. What's that formula again? Oh yeah, it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait—no, I think that's when you're moving at u and another frame is moving at v relative to you. Or is it when you want to find the relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction?

Let me think. Both are moving in the same direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, the relative speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ). Wait, no, that can't be right because that would give a negative speed, but relative speed is a positive value. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value of the difference.

Wait, maybe I should clarify: the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line. If object 1 is moving at u and object 2 at v, then the relative speed of object 2 from object 1's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it (u - v) divided by [1 - (uv)/c²]?

Wait, the formula is (u' = (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)) ), where u is the velocity of one object in the other's frame. So in this case, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, what is B's velocity? Since both are
