Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a 2x2 matrix because it's acting on a qubit, which is a two-level system. Let me write out what this matrix looks like.

I recall that |0⟩ is a column vector [1, 0] and |1⟩ is [0,1]. So, |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 scales everything down by half. So ρ becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, that's the identity matrix scaled by 0.5. So the density matrix is a completely mixed state. Because a mixed state means the qubit is in a statistical mixture of states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with 50% probability.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this matrix in qubit space. I think here they're referring to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z) corresponding to the angles in the density matrix's parameters.

The general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z) such that |r| ≤ 1. If ρ is a pure state, then |r|=1; for a mixed state, |r| < 1.

So let's express our ρ in terms of this formula. Our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute the expectation with the Pauli matrices.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So ρ = (I)/2 + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

In our case, ρ is (I)/2 because the other terms (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) sum to I. So when we expand ρ, the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, σ_z must be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0
