Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using something called the Bragg's law or maybe the interplanar spacing formula. But wait, Bragg's law is more about the relationship between wavelength and angles for diffraction. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula is what I need here.

The crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, right? Or maybe it's a separate system. Wait, no, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal but they can be different from 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. That's quite a distortion from the cubic system.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I'm assuming that's the lattice parameter 'a'. So in a cubic system, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that’s for a cubic crystal where all the angles are 90 degrees. Since this is a rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic system with all edges equal but angles not necessarily 90, I need to adjust the formula.

I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is more complex because the unit cell isn't cubic anymore. The formula involves the angles. Let me think. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d = (a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) )^{-1} but wait, no, maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a
