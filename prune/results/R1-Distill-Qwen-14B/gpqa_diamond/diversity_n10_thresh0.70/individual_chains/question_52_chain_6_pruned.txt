Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change. But how does that affect the ionization of atoms in their photosphere?

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that can't be rightâ€”wait, dark spots are cooler, so the star's overall brightness would decrease. But wait, how does the effective temperature change? Oh, right, effective temperature is related to the luminosity and radius. But in this case, the star's surface is 40% covered by spots, which are cooler. So the overall Teff would decrease, which it does from 6000 to 5500 K.

The key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

Wait, the ratio R is the number of atoms in level 2 divided by level 1. No, wait. Oh wait, the ratio is the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, R (level1/level2) is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_spot = R_quiet * factor, but I need to find R_quiet / R_spot. Oh, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is R_quiet / R_spot.

Now, the transition between the two levels is at about 1448 Angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. Wait, 1448 is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the far UV. So that's probably the ionizing photons, or at least in the range where transitions are possible.

The photosphere is in LTE, so the Boltzmann equation applies. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

But wait, since we're looking at the ratio of level 1 to level 2, it's (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, let me get that right. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (E_i
