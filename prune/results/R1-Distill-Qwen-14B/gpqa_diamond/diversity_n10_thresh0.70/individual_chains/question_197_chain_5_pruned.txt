Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction called the Hunsdiecker reaction. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's the reaction where we get allylic iodides? Oh right, the Witting reaction? Or wait, maybe it's the reaction where allylic positions are attacked. Oh wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wittig reaction setup, but more accurately, I think they're used in the formation of ylides, like the ylide formation step in the Wittig reaction. Or maybe it's the preparation of an ylide, which then reacts with an aldehyde or ketone. Wait, but the question is about a reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the use of HI in the presence of red phosphorus for elimination. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the replacement of certain groups, like maybe converting an alcohol to an iodide. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the IR and NMR data given for Compound X. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretching. Then 1720 cm-1—that's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That could be an acidic proton, perhaps an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. But it's a broad signal, which might suggest it's an -OH proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because aldehyde protons are usually sharp singlets. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton, but that's less likely. Wait, but a broad peak could also be an exchange with water, like an -OH. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid
