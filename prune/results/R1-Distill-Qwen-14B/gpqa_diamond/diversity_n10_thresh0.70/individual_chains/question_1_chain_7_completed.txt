Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. But wait, when considering the energy difference, you have to think about how the uncertainty in the energy of each state affects their distinguishability.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have two states, each has their own lifetime. But when you're considering the energy difference between them, I think the uncertainty in time comes from the measurement or observation period. Or perhaps the time over which the measurement occurs. Alternatively, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the width of each energy state. Each state has a certain lifetime, which implies a certain uncertainty in energy. Because the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ℏ/(Δt), where Δt is the lifetime of the state. So, for each state, its energy has a spread of about ℏ divided by its lifetime.

So, the first state (E1) has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec. The uncertainty in E1 would be ΔE1 ≈ ℏ/τ1. Similarly, E2 has a lifetime τ2 = 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ≈ ℏ/τ2. 

But wait, when considering the two states, their energy levels might overlap if the difference between E2 and E1 is smaller than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if E2 - E1 is less than (ΔE1 + ΔE2), then their energy regions would overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

Wait, actually, the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguished. Because if the difference is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, then their energy levels don't overlap. 

So the condition would be |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2. 

First, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Let's compute ℏ in eV·s because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So, let's compute ℏ in eV·s.

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ℏ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, compute ΔE1 = ℏ / τ1. τ1 is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. That's about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ℏ / τ2. τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV. So, about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, the original formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ℏ. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ℏ / τ. So the calculations above are correct.

So, the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this sum, 7.24e-7 eV, for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of the options are close to 1e-7 eV. The largest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. Let's see: 1e-4 eV is much bigger than 7.24e-7 eV (since 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV). So, 1e-4 eV is way larger than the required 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, so then the energy difference needs to be at least about 7e-7 eV. So any option larger than this would allow the two states to be distinguished. The options given are:

A) 1e-9 eV: 0.000000001 eV. That's much smaller than 7e-7, so it's too small.

B) 1e-11 eV: 0.00000000001 eV. Also way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV: 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is much larger than 7e-7. So this would suffice.

D) 1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV. Still smaller than 7e-7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because perhaps I got the condition wrong. Maybe the energy difference only needs to be greater than the individual uncertainty, not the sum.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of their energy levels. Each state has a certain energy, and an uncertainty (width) around it. So, E1 is somewhere, and E2 is somewhere else. The separation between the two must be at least the sum of their uncertainties, so that their energy regions don't overlap.

So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. So, that's what I thought earlier.

So, the minimum energy difference needed is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any option with a difference larger than this would work.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 7.24e-7.

Wait, but wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So, 0.0001 is much bigger. So option C would work.

So why are the other options so small? Let me think again. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the uncertainties. Let me recheck.

Wait, tau is the lifetime. So for E1, tau is 1e-9 s. So:

ΔE1 = ℏ / tau = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, E2 has tau=1e-8 s, so ΔE2=6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be at least that. So, if the options had, say, 1e-6 eV, that's 0.000001 eV, which is 1e-6. That's about 1.4 times larger than 7e-7, so it would work.

But the only option even larger than that is C) 1e-4 eV.

So, the correct answer would be option C. Because 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7, so the energy difference is sufficient for the two states to be distinguished.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 1e-4 eV. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought. Maybe the uncertainty isn't the sum, but just one of them. Because perhaps the measurement time is the time over which you're observing the states. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the broader approach is: the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is ℏ divided by the measurement time. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the measurement time is related to the lifetimes of the states.

Wait, I might be confusing the concepts here. Let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle is about the uncertainty in measuring the energy over a certain time. So, if the states have short lifetimes, their energies are uncertain by a larger amount.

If you have two states, A and B, each with their own lifetimes, then the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than ΔE_A + ΔE_B.

So, if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7 eV, then yes, they can be distinguished.

Looking at the options, the only option that is larger than 7e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV).

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is at least \( \hbar \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \).

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

Thus, the only option that ensures the energy levels can be clearly distinguished is **C**.

Answer: C
