Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options given are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations of A and B.

Hmm, right. So I think these reactions involve some kind of substitution or addition. Let me break it down.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ion, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone group in butan-2-one can undergo nucleophilic addition because the carbonyl is a good electrophile.

In a typical nucleophilic addition to a ketone, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, then after that, what happens? Oh, right, after the nucleophilic attack, the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which is then protonated. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me write the structure:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let
