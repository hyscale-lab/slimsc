Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix is given by Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional, so the coefficients aren't necessarily normalized yet. So I'll calculate the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (1+i)(2-i) multiplied by the inner products of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So (1-i)(2+i) for the first term and (2-i)(1+i) for the second term? Wait, wait, no, because when you take the inner product, the second term comes from the |down> part. Let me compute each component.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So <alpha| is (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|. So when you compute <alpha|alpha>, it's (1-i)(2+i) * <up|up> + (1-i)(2-i) * <up|down> + (2+i)(1+i) * <down|up> + (2+i)(2-i) * <down|down>.

But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, <up|down> = 0 and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So the cross terms (which involve (1-i)(2-i) and (2+i)(1+i)) will vanish because of the orthonormality. So the inner product becomes |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the inner product is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 because each term is the magnitude squared of the coefficients.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1+i) ?

Wait no, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the inner product is (1-i)(1+i) |<up|up>| + (1-i)(2-i) |<up|down>| + (2+i)(1+i) |<down|up>| + (2+i)(2-i) |<down|down>|.

But since |<up|down>| is zero, the cross terms vanish. So it's (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i).
