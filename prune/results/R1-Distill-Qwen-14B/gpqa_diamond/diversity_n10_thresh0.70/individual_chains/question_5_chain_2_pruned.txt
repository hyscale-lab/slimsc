Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it again. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are provided, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, quantum mechanics eigenvectors... right, so the operator here is P, which is a vector operator. The components are given. Oh, right, since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator in that direction would be a combination of Px and Pz. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector n is zero. So, any direction in x-z can be written as a linear combination of x and z directions. 

So, the operator for an arbitrary direction would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. But I don't think I need to get into that yet. The question is about finding the eigenvector of P along n, so I can write P as a combination of Px and Pz.

The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, the eigenvector |ψ> satisfies P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me first write down the matrices for each component. 

Given:
Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along n would be n_x Px + n_z Pz. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

Substituting the matrices:

P = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to:

P = (ħ/2) * [
[ n_z, n_x ],
[ n_x, -n_z ]
]

Because, for the top-left element, it's n_z, top-right is n_x, bottom-left is n_x, and bottom-right is -n_z.

So, the matrix representation of P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is the same as (ħ/2) * 1. So, setting up the eigenvalue equation:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Wait, no, wait. Because P is (ħ
