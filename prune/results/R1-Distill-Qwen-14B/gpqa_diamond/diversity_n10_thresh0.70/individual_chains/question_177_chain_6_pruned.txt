Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, I think the key here is to find the ratio of their luminosities.

The problem says both stars have the same radius ratio and mass ratio. Wait, Star_1 has 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, same with mass. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh right, for main-sequence stars, more massive stars are more luminous. But in this problem, the stars' luminosity is probably being calculated using their blackbody radiation, which depends on radius and temperature, not directly on mass. But wait, the problem says to assume they radiate as blackbodies, so I should focus on that.

Wait, the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that's about their peak emission. Remember that the peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. Because same λ_max implies T1 = T2.

Wait, but if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio would be based on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is about 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, let me read the question again. Oh, there's something about radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation? Oh wait, radial velocity usually affects the observed wavelength via the Doppler effect. But the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both, which would
