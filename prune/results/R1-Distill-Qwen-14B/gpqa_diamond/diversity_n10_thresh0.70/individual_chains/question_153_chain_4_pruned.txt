Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. There are three reactions given, labeled as (A), (B), and (C), and I need to find the major products for each. Then, I have to match them with the options provided.

First, I'll start by recalling what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually a conjugate base (like an enolate), attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond, and the carbonyl group gets deprotonated, leading to a resonance-stabilized intermediate.

Looking at the reactions:

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base, which would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen of the malonate to form an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester and the central carbon is acidic. The enolate would form, and then attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Wait, but in this case, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-p-tolyl-OCH3? No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CO-p-tolyl group connected to the acrylate. Wait, wait, the structure is more like CH₂=CH-C-OCH3 but with the substituents. Let me think. No, actually, wait: the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is CH₂=C-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Wait, no—acrylate is CH₂=CH-COOR, but the substituents are on the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon of the acrylate. So it's CH₂-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Hmm, not quite. Wait, perhaps it's CH₂=C(COPh)CH2? No, maybe I'm getting
