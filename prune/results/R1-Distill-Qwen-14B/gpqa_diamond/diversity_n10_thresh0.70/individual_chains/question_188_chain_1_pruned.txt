Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have threefold symmetry and all sides are equal, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice.

The given parameters are the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait. I think in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal, so a = b = c. So the lattice is cubic in a way, but with angles that might not be 90 degrees, so it's not a cubic system but a rhombohedral one.

The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula, which is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with angles maybe). Wait, no, wait. I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles between them is using the Miller indices (hkl), and the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²)) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) - ... wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh right, I think for the cubic case, it's simpler, but for non-cubic, we have to account
