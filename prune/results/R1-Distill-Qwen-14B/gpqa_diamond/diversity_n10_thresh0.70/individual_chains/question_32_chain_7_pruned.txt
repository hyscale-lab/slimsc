Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

So the nucleus in question is Li-6. I need to find the total energy it has when moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I think this is a relativistic energy problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light—96% is pretty high, so I can't use classical mechanics here.

First, I remember that the total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into that equation. So v squared is (0.96c)² which is 0.9216c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216, which is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So γ becomes 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216, right? So 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28? Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So γ is 1/0.28. Let me compute that division. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but I think for this problem, I can approximate it as the sum of the individual nucleons' masses. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So each proton is ~938, each neutron ~939. Let me sum that up.

So 3 protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. 3 neutrons: 3 * 939 = 2817 MeV. Total is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but that's the total rest mass if each is separate. But when they form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. Hmm, but I think in this case, since the problem doesn't give any specific information about binding energy, perhaps they expect me to use the sum of the individual masses as an approximation, or maybe they provide the mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should look up the actual mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic
