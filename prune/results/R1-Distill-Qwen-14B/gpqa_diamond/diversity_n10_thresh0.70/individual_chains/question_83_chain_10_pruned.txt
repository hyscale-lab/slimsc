Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should find the initial concentrations after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Wait, but wait, I have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³.

So initial concentration before titration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M acetic acid. Right, because 0.05 times 20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M.

Then, during titration with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction would be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. Let's find the equivalence point first. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.001 mol. So for equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

So 25% titration means we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Wait no, wait: 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So in solution, we have some reaction between acetic acid and NaOH.

Wait, let me think. For the 25% titration point, how much has reacted?

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So it's reacted with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 =
