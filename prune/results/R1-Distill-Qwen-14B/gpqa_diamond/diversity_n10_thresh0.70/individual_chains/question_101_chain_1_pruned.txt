Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the suitable reagent A and catalyst B for this reaction.

Wait, so the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? So 3-methyl would mean there's a methyl group on the third carbon of the pyrrolidine ring. 

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me draw this in my mind. The pyrrolidine ring now has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, maybe like a benzene ring but cyclohexane. Wait, no, cyclohexylidene is a substituent where a double bond is attached. Oh wait, cyclohexylidene is a part of a bicyclic structure, like a bridged compound. Or perhaps it's a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected via a double bond. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached via a double bond to a methyl group, which is connected to the pyrrolidine.

So the product structure is the original pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a double bond to a methyl group. So it's a bridged ring maybe? Or perhaps a ring expansion? Wait, no, maybe it's an exocyclic double bond. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is acid-catalyzed. So what kind of reactions happen under acid catalysis with amines? Maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, thinking about the structure of the product, the substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. That sounds like a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH2 group. So maybe the pyrrolidine is undergoing some kind of ring expansion or an addition reaction where a cyclohexene is formed.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an
