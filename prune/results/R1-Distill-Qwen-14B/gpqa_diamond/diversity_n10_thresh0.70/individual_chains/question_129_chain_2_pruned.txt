Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

The question gives a reaction scheme and some hints. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C. Next, compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Hmm, let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B
HCN usually adds to a carbonyl group. So A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. When HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A.

Step 2: B → C using H2 and Pd
Reduction with H2 and Pd. Since B is a cyanohydrin (which has an -OH and a -CN group), reducing it under hydrogen would probably reduce the nitrile group. Wait, nitriles can be reduced to amines, but wait, with H2 and Pd, maybe it's hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps, the Pd catalyst might do something else. Or maybe the cyanohydrin's -CN is reduced to a -CH2NH2 group? Wait, no, more likely, the nitrile group (-CN) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-). Because, for example, when you hydrogenate a nitrile, you typically get an amine, but if it's a different condition, perhaps using H2 and a catalyst like Pd, maybe it's a hydrogenation to an alkane. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Oh, wait, H2 and Pd as a catalyst... when you have a nitrile, typically, under hydrogenation, it would be reduced to an amine. But in the presence of Pd, perhaps it's a different pathway. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine, but then what happens to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, another possibility: the cyanohydrin has an -OH and -CN group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)-CN? Or is it R2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, wait, when HCN adds to a ketone (like R2CO), the product is R2C(OH)CN, so the cyanide is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So it's a vicinal diol situation? No, wait, no, the structure would be R2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, no. Let me think. The reaction of HCN with a ketone: for example, acetone (propan-2-one) reacts with HCN to form (R)- and (S)-2-hydroxypropanen
