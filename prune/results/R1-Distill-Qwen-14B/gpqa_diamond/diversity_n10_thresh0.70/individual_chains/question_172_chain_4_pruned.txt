Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures related to the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula I recall is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, it means the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher. So for star_1, let's say the ratio is n1' (excited) / n2' (ground) = 2. For star_2, it's n1'' / n2'' = 1, assuming star_2 has half the excitation. Or wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state that's 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the excited fraction compared to another state. Hmm, perhaps the exact wording is that the excitation is twice as much in star_1.

Wait, the question says the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, perhaps the ratio of the excited states is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Let me think.

So, for star_1, the excitation level (excited to a higher energy) is twice that of star_2. So, if we let the ratio for star_1 be R1 and for star_2 be R2, then R1 = 2 R2. But
