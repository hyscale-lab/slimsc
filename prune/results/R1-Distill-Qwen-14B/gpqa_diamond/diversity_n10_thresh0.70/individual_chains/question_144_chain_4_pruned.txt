Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find its mean decay distance. The given values are: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

I remember that mesons are particles made of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that don't live very long before decaying, so their mean decay distance would be very small. But how do I calculate that exactly?

Wait, the mean decay distance probably depends on the lifetime of the meson. The formula I think I remember is that the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, what's the relation between the width and the lifetime?

Oh right! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) to the lifetime τ. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, what's the exact relation? Because I think the uncertainty principle gives ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, so if Γ is the energy uncertainty (the width is the uncertainty in energy), then τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by τ
