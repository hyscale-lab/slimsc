Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Finally, compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also some hints provided:

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with carbonyl groups. So I think compound A must have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The product of the Wittig reaction is a substituted cyclopentane with a double bond. Let me try drawing that structure.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's see. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. So, the structure would have a double bond from position 4 to another part. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the cyclopentane ring has a substituent that's a vinyl group attached.

So the Wittig reaction forms a double bond. The starting material A must have a carbonyl group, and the ylide would attack it. The product structure suggests that the carbonyl group was part of a cyclopentane ring. Maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's think about that.

If compound A is a ketone, like cyclopentanone with some substituents, the Wittig reaction would convert the ketone into an alkene. For example, suppose A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then the Wittig would add a group, perhaps, but wait, the product in hint a has the substituents at 1 and 2 as methyl, and a propan-2-ylidene group at 4. So maybe the starting ketone in A has substituents that, when the Wittig is done, form that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone with a substituent that becomes the propan-2-ylidene group. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a leaving group, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the product structure again. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent at position 4, which is a vinyl group (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)= attached to the ring). Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, right? So it's like a substituent that's a propenyl group attached at position 4.

So in the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (like a ketone) would react with the ylide. The ylide would add to the carbonyl, then an elimination happens to form the double bond. So if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, the ylide would add to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a new double bond.

But I'm not entirely clear on that. Maybe I should move on to the IR hints and see if that helps.

Hint b says that the IR of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So compound A has a carbonyl group, probably a ketone since 1750 is in the range for ketones (aldehydes are a bit higher, maybe around 1720, but it can vary). So A is likely a ketone.

Compound E's IR has a peak around 1715 cm^-1. That's also a carbonyl, but lower than A's. Hmm. So E has a carbonyl, but maybe it's a different kind of group than A. Or perhaps it's an ester or a different type of ketone. Alternatively, maybe E is an ester or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Looking at the reaction steps:

1. A â†’ B with HCN. Reaction with HCN typically adds a cyanide group. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

2. B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst, so it would reduce unsaturated bonds. But B comes from A via HCN addition, which is a nucleophilic addition. So A is a ketone, B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. The addition of HCN to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a cyanide on adjacent carbons. So structure-wise, the ketone (say R2CO) becomes R2C(OH)CN after adding HCN.

Then, when you reduce B with H2 and Pd, it's probably a catalytic hydrogenation. So the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (NH2) or perhaps to an amine, but wait, more accurately, nitriles upon hydrogenation typically become amines. Wait, no, nitriles when hydrogenated with H2 and catalysts like Pd give primary amines. But wait, if B is a cyanohydrin, it's R2C(OH)CN. So when you reduce that, the OH would become an O-H (but maybe it's protected or something), but the nitrile group would be reduced.

Wait, maybe I should think more clearly. The cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. When you hydrogenate that, you add H2 in the presence of a catalyst. The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2? Or perhaps to an amine group. Alternatively, wait, no, the reduction of nitriles (RCN) typically gives primary amines (RCH2NH2), but I might be mixing things up. Or maybe the nitrile is first converted to an imine, then reduced. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the nitrile group would be reduced to an amine.

Wait, but in the reaction step, compound B is being reduced to C. So B is R2C(OH)CN. Upon reduction, perhaps the nitrile (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile becomes a methylene group. Wait, no, more accurately, the nitrile group (R-CN) upon hydrogenation with H
