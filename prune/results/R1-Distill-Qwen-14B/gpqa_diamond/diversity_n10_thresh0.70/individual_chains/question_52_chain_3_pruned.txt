Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by understanding the question.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. How does that affect the ratio?

Wait, the ratio is (n1)/(n2). Let me think. The energy levels are such that if level 2 is higher than level 1, then when temperature increases, more atoms would be excited to higher levels, increasing n2. So, the ratio n1/n2 would decrease with higher temperature because n2 increases more than n1.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio (n2/n1) increases. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So higher T makes this ratio bigger. So if the spots cause the overall T to drop, then (n2/n1) would decrease, meaning (n1/n2) would increase. But according to the problem, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. That suggests that the
