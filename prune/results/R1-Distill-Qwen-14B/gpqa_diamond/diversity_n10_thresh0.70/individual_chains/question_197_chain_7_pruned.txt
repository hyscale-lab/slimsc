Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data are key here. I'll start with the IR.

The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But the broadness isn't specified here, so maybe it's an O-H stretch. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic rings—C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, possibly an ester or a ketone. Also, the 3400–2500 region could be due to an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids. So, that's a strong clue that there's a carboxylic acid group present.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests substitution on the ring. Since each is a doublet with 2H each, it's likely a para-substituted benzene. So, the structure has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a larger substituent. It might be a CH group attached to another group, like a ketone or an ester.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl group or something similar.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H, so a CH3 group attached to something else, maybe a CH2. This could be an isopropyl group or a substituent on a branching.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, typical of a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe there's an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (since the OH is present), but wait, the IR had a carbonyl at 1720. Wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but maybe it's an ester or ketone? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR shows an -OH at 10.5, which fits a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position. But the IR also has a peak at 1720, which could be the carbonyl of the acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. But the presence of the O-H suggests it's a carboxylic acid. So structure-wise, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative with some substituent.

Looking at the substituent on the benzene, let's see. The protons at 2.9 ppm, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm probably form a chain attached to the ring. Let's think about the splitting.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm multiplet could be a CH2 connected to something else, maybe a CH. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is 3H, so perhaps a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait a minute, maybe the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group. Let's think: a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But wait, let's see. Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group? No, because the 0.9 is a triplet, which suggests it's at the end of a chain. Wait, let's map the substituent.

The substituent attached to the benzene could be a group like -CH2-C(CH2CH3)- something. Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)2? No,
