Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to recall.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think bosonic fields couple with fermions here. So the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find out what particles it can decay into, kinematically allowed at the lowest order. That probably means looking for decay products whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, right, because in decay processes, the mass of the parent particle has to be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So for X to decay into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Now, looking at the possible options, they list various fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into pairs like quarks or leptons. Let's list them:

Option A: bb, ss, uu, dd, tau+tau-, e+ e-.
Option B: cc, ss, uu, dd, tau, mu, e pairs.
Option C includes tt, which is top quark pair. But top quarks are really heavy, each about 173 GeV, so their sum is way over 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks. So option C is out.
Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but what about the fermion types that X can interact with? The Lagrangian term has ψ_f, so f is the fermion type. In the term, the interaction seems to be proportional to the fermion's charge or something? Or maybe it's just that X can interact with any fermion, but in reality, the coupling might depend on the type.

Wait, no, in the given Lagrangian, the term is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. So X couples to all fermions. So for decay, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass allows.

So
