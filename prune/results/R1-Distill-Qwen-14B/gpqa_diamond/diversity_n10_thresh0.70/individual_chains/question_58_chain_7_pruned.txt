Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, which is a problem because we can't have physical infinities.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I need to think about each option.

Starting with Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. But wait, isn't QED renormalizable? Oh right, because it's a renormalizable theory, it can handle the divergences using renormalization. But wait, does that mean it doesn't require regularization? Or does it still need regularization as part of the renormalization process?

I'm a bit confused. Regularization is a step in renormalization where you make the divergences appear as finite terms so you can absorb them. So QED does require regularization, but perhaps it's more about whether the regularization is necessary beyond that. Or maybe the question is about whether the theory is free from needing regularization because it's already finite.

Wait, no. QED does have divergences, so it needs regularization. So I think QED requires regularization. So option C might not be the correct answer.

Moving on to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force, dealing with quarks and gluons. It's also a quantum field theory and non-abelian. I remember that QCD has issues with things like Landau poles, meaning perturbation theory might break down at high energies. Does it require regularization? Well, maybe for calculations, especially in perturbation theory, you have to regularize the infinities. But wait, when considering confinement and other phenomena, I'm not sure if regularization is necessary in the same way.

Wait, no. All quantum field theories typically require regularization because of the divergences. So both QED and QCD would require regularization. But maybe the question is about which one doesn't, perhaps because it's a different kind of theory.

What about Superstring Theory? String theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, beyond quantum field theory. In string theory, particles are not point-like but rather strings. I think that in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, and perhaps the theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as QFT. Because string theories are background-dependent and maybe the higher-order terms are softer.

Wait, I recall that in string theory, the perturbative expansion doesn't lead to the same kind of divergences that QFT does because of the way the interactions work. Or maybe they have different kinds of divergences but manage them through other means, like using the string tension or the higher spin states. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization in the same way as QFTs. Or maybe it doesn't need it at all when considering the theory in a certain way.

Wait, but wait. Even string theory, when you calculate loop diagrams, you can get divergences. But string theory has a concept of "tachyon" which can cause problems, but I'm not sure about regularization. Maybe in some formulations, you need to regularize, but in others, you don't.
