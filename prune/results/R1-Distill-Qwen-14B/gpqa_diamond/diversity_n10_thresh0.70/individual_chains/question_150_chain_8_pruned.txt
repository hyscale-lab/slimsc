Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after a series of reactions, I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from rings and double bonds. Five DoU could be two rings and one double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – A doublet, integrating to 2H. This could be from an aromatic ring, perhaps with substituents. Like maybe para-substituted phenyl groups. Because in a para-disubstituted benzene, each proton is a doublet if there's another substituent.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – Another doublet, 2H. Maybe adjacent to the first set, suggesting a di-substituted aromatic ring. Wait, or perhaps this is part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group attached to the benzene.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – Broad singlet. 2H. Broad suggests possibly exchange with something or maybe adjacent to an acidic proton. Maybe this is from an adjacent aromatic ring with substituents or perhaps from an enol or something like that.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – A doublet, 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Putting this together: The NMR suggests an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm), two different aromatic regions, and an OCH2 group.

So the structure might involve an aldehyde, a benzene ring, and another group. Let me think about the molecular formula. C8H9NO: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen.

Wait, maybe it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Since the molecular formula has C8H9NO. Let me see: benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But here we have more carbons and different substituents.

Alternatively, the compound could have a structure where a benzene ring is attached to a side chain that includes the aldehyde, an oxygen, and a nitrogen.

Wait, the H at 3.66 ppm as a doublet for 2H suggests it's connected to something. Maybe a CH2 group connected to two oxygen atoms or one oxygen and something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrogeneous ring, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, the molecular formula includes a nitrogen. So perhaps it's a secondary amine or an amide or something else. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 7-8 ppm that would suggest an amine proton. Since the triplet at 9.72 is probably the aldehyde, maybe the nitrogen is part of another group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the protons are only H, so the nitrogen could be in an amide group or part of a ring. Hmm.

Looking back, the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.7
