Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson called X. Let's try to figure this out step by step.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ_f f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, I remember that in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions proportionally to their mass. So the interaction term here looks similar, implying that X might be similar to the Higgs boson. But wait, in the problem, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV. Oh wait, that's way lighter than the Higgs, which is around 125 GeV. So maybe X is a different particle, but the interaction is similar.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. So I need to look at which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

First, kinematically allowed means the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermions involved because the rest mass of the products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle. Since X is 6 GeV, the fermions it can decay into must each have a mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

Wait, but let me think about the possible fermions. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks and leptons. Quarks come in different flavors, each with their own masses. But wait, the masses of quarks are a bit tricky because they're not as well-known as, say, the top quark. But let me recall the approximate masses:

Up and down quarks are the lightest. I think their masses are around a few MeV. Then the strange quark is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV, and top is about 173 GeV.

Leptons include electrons, muons, taus, and neutrinos. The electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon around 105 MeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are even lighter, but their masses are negligible compared to GeV scales.

So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV.

Looking at quarks first: The up, down, strange, and charm quarks. Wait, the charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so twice that is 3 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, it can decay into a pair of charm quarks because 1.5*2=3 ≤6.

Wait, but wait: each fermion in a pair is one particle and its antiparticle. So for X → c c̄, each c has a mass of about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is less than
