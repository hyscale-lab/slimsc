Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to spin matrices. For a muon, which is a lepton, I think it has spin-1/2, so the spin matrices should be the Pauli matrices or something similar.

The problem says that Ay is given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? Oh wait, no, wait—wait, the problem says c is h/(4π), but wait, I've heard that the spin matrices S have eigenvalues related to ħ. Wait, maybe the constant here is in terms of h instead of ħ. Let me make sure.

Wait, the Planck constant h is related to ħ by h = 2πħ. So, if c is h/(4π), that's (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh wait, no: wait, c is given as h/(4π). So, c = (h)/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Because h=2πħ. So c is ħ/2. Wait, no, because if h is 2πħ, then c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So that's right.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, what's the matrix S given? The first row is (0, -i), the second row is (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix:
S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Because the Pauli matrices are usually defined as:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S is actually σy. So S = σy.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of σy are the same as any Pauli matrix, which are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, the eigenvalues are given in terms of h. So let me express ħ in terms of h. Since ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is (h/(2π)) / 2 = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π) * 1. So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait, that doesn't match the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±... Wait, that can't be right. No, because the eigenvalues are real for σy. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait. No, wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but I think I'm confusing something here. Wait, the operator Ay is (ħ/2) σy. So its eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). Which is ± h/(4π) (since ħ = h/(2π)). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any option talking about the imaginary part of the eigenvalue would be wrong, right? Because the eigenvalues are real.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Talks about imaginary parts ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

Option B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option C) Says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Hmm, since A is the angular momentum operator, A^2 is the square. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenfunctions of the components are not the same as eigenfunctions of A^2. Wait, but any state is an eigenstate of A^2 (since A^2 is a scalar operator, it's same for all states). So in that case, the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A^2, because A^2 has the same eigenvalue for all states (since for spin-1/2, A^2 = (ħ/2)^2 * s(s+1), where s=1/2. So A² has eigenvalue (ħ²/4)(3/4) )? Wait, no: wait, the magnitude squared of angular momentum is A² = (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2, so for a spin-1/2 particle, A² has eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 (since spin s=1/2, so s(s+1) = (3/4) ħ²). So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is a scalar. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are a basis where Ay is diagonal, but Az would have different eigenvalues. So if a state is eigen to Ay, it's not necessarily eigen to Az (unless it's also an eigenstate of Az, which would require being a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible for eigenstates of all three, but for spin-1/2, you can't have all three components non-zero. Wait, but for eigenstates of Ay, they are not eigenstates of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax, so they don't commute.

So option C could be correct.

Option D) Says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure if option D is correct. Because the eigenfunctions are just a set of vectors that form a basis. So statement D is correct in a sense, but perhaps the question is about whether the pair of eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, the operator Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, yes. So option D could be correct.

Wait, but the problem says which statement is correct during the calculation. So let me think: during the calculation, which of these statements would be correct.

Wait, let's go back. The question is about which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, that's a bit vague. The basis functions of the operator, perhaps meaning that the eigenvectors form the basis for the matrix. Which they do, because they are a basis for the vector space (since it's 2x2, two eigenvectors would form a basis). So D is correct.

Wait, but what about the other options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So since A² is a scalar operator, any state is an eigenstate of A², as I thought. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². So the first part of C is correct. The second part, that they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are different, so a state eigen to Ay is not eigen to Az. So C is correct in the statement.

Wait, so both C and D might be correct statements. But in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me look again.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So the student is supposed to think about what they would consider when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not exactly sure what "basis functions of the matrix operator" means. Maybe it's referring to the eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis for the matrix. Since the operator is 2x2, yes, the two eigenvectors would form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator. That is, the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So yes, when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenvectors form the basis. So D is correct.

But wait, let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Since A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix in spin space, any state is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct. The second part, that they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because, for a spin-1/2 particle, the components don't commute, so you can't have a state that's an eigenstate of both Ay and Az, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are those that relate to the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A: The imaginary part is ±2πh or something. No.

Option B: Similarly incorrect.

Option C: Correct in both parts.

Option D: Correct as well.

But wait, looking again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are a basis. So yes, that's correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but now I'm a bit stuck. Because both C and D seem correct. But I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, the question gives four options, and only one is correct. So which is correct.

Let me think about each statement.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part is correct. The second part, not being an eigenstate of Az, is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement you would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

But looking again, the options are:

Option C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, is it an eigenstate of A²? Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. So any state is an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

So the statement in C is correct.

Wait, but wait, if A² is a scalar, then all states are its eigenstates. So yes, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But the statement in C says 'can also be' which is correct. So statement C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought D is correct. So now I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a scalar), but not of Az.

So I think option C is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the eigenvalues. Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, only option C and D are left.

Looking at the options again, option D is correct if the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, which they do. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenvectors are the basis.

So which one is the correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Because when you find the eigenfunctions, they form a basis, which is a standard result.

Alternatively, the question could be pointing to the fact that the eigenfunctions are not orthogonal. Wait, but in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal if the matrix is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Ay is given as (h/(4pi)) * S, where S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the same as S. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay is Hermitian because it's a product of a real constant and a Hermitian matrix.

So the eigenvalues are real, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

So for a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and they form an orthonormal basis. So the eigenfunctions are orthogonal, and they form a basis for R^2 (or C^2 in this case). So statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which makes sense. So D is correct.

But then, why is option C correct? Because any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. So statement C is correct.

Hmm, the problem is that both C and D are correct statements. But the options require only one correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in analyzing one of them.

Wait, looking back at the question: which statement is correct during the calculation.

So perhaps during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you consider that the eigenfunctions can form a basis, which is option D. Or, you find that they are eigenfunctions of A², which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So in that case, option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, any state that's an eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity. So that's correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

That's also correct because the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the 2D space.

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options can't have two correct answers, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of the operator.

Wait, the problem says that the matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0), which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So S = σy.

So the operator Ay is c * σy, where c = h/(4π).

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (±1) = ±c. So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but the options don't have this. Looking again:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Yes, as explained earlier.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis. Yes.

So which is the correct statement?

The question is which statement is correct during the eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C because the fact that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² is a significant point. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the eigenvalues and see.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

To find the eigenvalues, we solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a       (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i         (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ]

Which is:

[ -a       -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)^2 - ( (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) = a² - ( (i)(-i) (h/(4π))² )

Wait, let's compute that: (i)(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant equation is:

a² - (1) * (h/(4π))² = 0.

So a² = (h²)/(16 π²).

Thus, a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π).

So looking back at the options, which statement is correct.

Option C says eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is a multiple of identity, any state is an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors of Ay (a 2x2 matrix) form a basis, D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But that can't be, as the options are exclusive.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you find that they form an orthonormal basis, which is D's statement. But the question is about the statements you would consider when calculating. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

I'm a bit stuck, but considering the options, I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, \( \sigma_y \). The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, and no imaginary parts are present.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and there are no imaginary components.

2. **Option B**: This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: This option asserts that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). Since \( A^2 \) is a scalar operator (representing the square of the angular momentum), any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). Additionally, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenstate of \( A_y \) is not an eigenstate of \( A_z \). This statement is correct.

4. **Option D**: This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). Since \( A_y \) is a 2×2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space. This statement is also correct.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct. However, the question specifies that only one statement is correct during the calculation. Since the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) being eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) is a significant and distinct property, **option C** is the most relevant and correct choice.

Answer: C
