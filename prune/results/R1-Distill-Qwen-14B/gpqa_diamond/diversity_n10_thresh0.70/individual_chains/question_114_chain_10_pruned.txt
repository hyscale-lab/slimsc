Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible reagents A and B.

Hmm. Let me start by looking at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. It's reacting with NaCN. I remember that the nucleophilic addition to ketones typically involves something like a cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile. Oh wait, when ketones react with HCN or CN- under certain conditions, they add the CN group. 

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so when it adds CN-, perhaps it forms something. The product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the carbonyl is between two methyl groups. So adding CN- would probably add to the carbonyl group, making a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, right! The reaction of ketones with HCN or CN- in acidic conditions gives a cyanohydrin. 

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see its structure. The formula would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on the second carbon, and so is the hydroxyl. That would make the structure (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, but butanenitrile is a four-carbon chain with a nitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the second carbon, and so is the hydroxyl. So the molecule would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, no, butane has four carbons. Let me count: the nitrile is at position 2, and the hydroxyl also at position 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- in acidic conditions, the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation involves the attack of the CN- on the carbonyl carbon, followed by proton transfer. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons. Wait, but in this case, the product has both groups on the same carbon. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon, which is the same carbon as the two methyl groups, then the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons, so perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)
