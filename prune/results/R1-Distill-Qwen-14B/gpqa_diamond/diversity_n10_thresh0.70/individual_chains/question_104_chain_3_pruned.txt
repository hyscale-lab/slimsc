Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

So the key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms, I think), and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured here, right? The shift in wavelength is related to this velocity.

The Doppler shift formula is something like (Δλ / λ) = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So the shift in wavelength (in angstroms) depends on the velocity of the star moving towards or away from us.

Wait, but here they're giving the shift as milliangstroms, which is 1e-3 angstroms. So for Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, which is 5e-3 angstroms. Similarly, Planet #2 is 7e-3 angstroms.

But how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I think the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star (semi-major axis, a).

The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) * something else... Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (P (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so that term goes away. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's (since the planet is Neptune mass, star is solar mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So perhaps I can simplify this.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / a ) )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe I should look at the formula for K more carefully. From what I remember, the formula is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / ( P (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )
