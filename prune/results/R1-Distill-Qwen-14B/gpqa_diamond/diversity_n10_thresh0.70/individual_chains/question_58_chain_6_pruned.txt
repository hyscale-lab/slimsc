Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let's start by recalling what regularization is.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't give meaningful physical predictions. So, regularization introduces a temporary modification to the theory to make these divergences manageable, allowing us to calculate finite results after renormalization.

The options given are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

I remember that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the theory of electromagnetism, and it does require renormalization because of the divergences. So option C isn't the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics deals with the strong force. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and it's known for having things like asymptotic freedom. But wait, does it require regularization? I think QCD does have issues with divergences, especially in perturbative calculations, so they might use regularization methods like lattice QCD or others. So B is probably not the correct choice either.

Superstring Theory is a type of string theory, which aims to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. I've heard that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Wait, but do they still require any form of regularization? I think in lower energies (or effective field theory), they might use similar techniques, but the full string theory might not need it because it's a theory that doesn't have the same loop divergences as in point particle theories. So A could be a candidate.

Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is the non-quantum version. It doesn't involve the same divergences because it's not a quantum theory. In classical E&M, you can have things like infinite charge densities at point charges, but these are more about the limitations of the classical theory itself rather than something that requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory tool, classical theories wouldn't need it. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but how about string theory? Superstring theory is a quantum theory, so wouldn't it deal with divergences somehow? But I think the key is that string theories don't have
