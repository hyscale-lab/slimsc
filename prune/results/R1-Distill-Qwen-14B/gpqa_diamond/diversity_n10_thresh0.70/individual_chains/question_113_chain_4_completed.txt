Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about determining the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That broad peak usually indicates an -OH group, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, but sometimes it's a little different. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the O-H stretch is usually around 3300-3500. But wait, the problem says a very broad peak at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical alcohols. Hmm. Another possibility is a conjugated carbonyl group, but that doesn't explain the broadness. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituent, but I'm not sure.

Then, two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could it be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like a conjugated ketone? The 1650 peak—what's that? Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be a C=C double bond. Wait, but the NMR part says there are vinyl hydrogens, which indicates a C=C, so that fits. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and conjugated double bonds.

Now, looking at the NMR. There are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So vinyl protons are those on a double bond, typically appearing between δ 5-7. The presence of these suggests there's a double bond in the structure, maybe an alkene or part of a ring system like an aromatic ring. Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring, the protons would be more deshielded and appear around 7 ppm or higher. But vinyl protons can be in different environments, so maybe it's an isolated double bond.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, that's a key clue. The m/z 45 fragment is significant. Let's think about possible fragments. Common fragments at 45 could be something like (CH3)2CO+, but wait, (CH3)2CO would have a mass of 58. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone or an ester. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be an ethylene group or something else. Alternatively, more accurately, m/z 45 is the molecular ion of some fragment. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait, no, methyl groups would be 2*(12 + 3) = 30, plus O is 16 → 46. Hmm, no. Wait, 45. Another possibility is C3H7O. Let me compute: C3H7O is (3*12) + (7*1) +16 = 36 +7 +16=60- no, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's a ketene fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O- something. Alternatively, think of common ions. A common fragment at m/z 45 is CH3CO+ (which is 43?), but I'm not certain. Maybe it's an acetyl group? Wait, acetyl is CH3CO, which is molecular weight 43 (12*2 + 1*3 +16= 43). So maybe it's something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formulas given have different degrees of unsaturation. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here.

Option A: C6H12O2. So C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one DoU. That would mean either one ring and/or one double bond, or two double bonds, etc. Wait, but 1 DoU could be one ring plus a double bond, but that's more than one. Wait, wait, 2C+2=14 (for C=6). 14 - H (12) = 2. 2/2=1. So one DoU.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10) /2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two DoU. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. Same as A.

So the possible DoUs are 1 or 2. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so one DoU), but the FTIR has both 1700 and 1650 peaks, which could indicate two DoU (like a conjugated carbonyl and another double bond, or maybe a carbonyl plus a ring).

Wait, but the FTIR has two peaks in the carbonyl region. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch), or maybe another carbonyl group but in a different environment, but that's less likely. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Looking back, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The IR suggests a carbonyl and possibly an aromatic ring. Wait, but the 1650 cm⁻¹ could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in an aromatic ring, which is around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹). So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an enone system (conjugated carbonyl and double bond).

Wait, but the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹—could that be an alcohol (O-H stretch)? If so, then the formula would have an -OH group. Let's see which options include O. All of them except maybe something else, but in our options, all have O except perhaps some, but no, all options have O.

Wait, no, looking at the options, all have O. So maybe it's an alcohol, but the presence of a carbonyl suggests it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. That would explain the broad O-H stretch (carboxylic acids have a very strong, broad O-H around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹). But the problem says the broad peak is at 3000, which is lower than typical. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH in an ether, but that's not usually that broad. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have a carbonyl (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹) and an O-H stretch? No, esters don't have O-H; they have an OR group. Wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is in a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. So the O-H must be something else. Maybe a phenol? Phenols have O-H stretches around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹, which could explain the broad peak. Phenol O-H is typically broader and a bit lower than aliphatic alcohols. So maybe it's a phenol.

If that's the case, then the compound has a phenol group (O-H) and a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a substituted phenol with a ketone or an ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester or something.

But given the options, let's think about possible structures. For example, if the structure has a benzene ring with a ketone group and a hydroxyl group, that would fit. But wait, given the molecular formulas, let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a benzene ring (C6H5-) with two substituents: maybe a hydroxyl and a carbonyl group. For example, acetophenone with a hydroxyl group? But that would be C6H5-C(O)-R. Alternatively, something like phenyl acetate, but that would have more oxygens. Wait, phenyl acetate is C6H5O2CCH3, so molecular formula C8H8O2. Not matching the options here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone? But that would require more carbonyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about what could fragment to give 45. A common fragment is (CH3)CO+, which is 43. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group fragment. Another possibility: the fragment could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO+? Let's compute: (CH3)2CHO is (2*12 + 6*1) +16 +12 +1= 24 +6 +16 +12 +1= 59? No. Wait, maybe I'm off. (CH3)2CHO would have a molecular weight of (2*CH3) + CHO. CH3 is 15, so 2*15=30, plus CHO (43? No, CHO is 12 +16 +1=29). So 30 +29=59. Not 45.

Wait another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown must have a molecular weight that allows for a fragment of 45. Let's calculate the molecular weights of the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. MW = (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW=72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW=72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. MW=72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z=116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), 100 (D).

But in the mass spec, the fragment peak is at 45. So the molecular weight must be higher than 45, which all of these are.

But how would the fragment form? Maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller part with a molecular weight of 45. So let's see. For each option, is there a possible fragment that sums to 45?

Take option C: C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structural fragments. For example, a fragment with C3H6O, which would be (3*12)+(6*1)+(16)=36+6+16=58. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone group. For example, if the compound has a (CH3)2CO group (which is 58), but that doesn't help. Wait, another possibility: if the structure has an ester group, maybe the ester oxygen leads to a fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester, and upon cleavage, it forms a smaller fragment.

Wait, let's think about the ester cleavage. For example, in an ester, the molecule can cleave at the ester oxygen, leading to two fragments. If the ester is R-O-CO-R', then upon fragmentation, it can break into R-O- and CO-R' parts. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CO+ group. CH2CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12*2 + 2 +16=44? Wait, CH2CO is C2H2O. So 2*12=24, H2 is 2, O is 16 → 24+2+16=42. Hmm, no, that's 42. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O. Let me calculate: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16 → 36+7+16=59. No. Wait, 45 is 36 (3*12) +9 = 45. So perhaps it's C3H9. But that's not possible because H can't be 9 for a neutral molecule. Alternatively, maybe O is involved. Wait, 45 is 36 +9. 36 is carbon, 9 is perhaps O (16) plus something? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O. Wait, (CH3)2O is dimethyl ether, which is 45 (12*2 +1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46). Oh, wait, it's 46. So that's not it. Then what gives 45? Let's compute possible combinations.

45 can be:

- C3H3O: 3*12=36, 3 H is 3, O is 16 → 36+3+16=55. No.

- C2H5NO: Nitrogen is tricky, but the options don't include N. So maybe ignoring that.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment with Cl, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion. Oh, wait, ketene is O=C=O? No, that's 44 (12*2 +16*2=44). Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures.

The NMR has vinyl protons, so the molecule has a double bond. The FTIR shows a broad O-H (maybe phenol), a carbonyl, and possibly another double bond. So maybe it's a substituted phenol with a ketone group. For example, acetophenone with a hydroxyl group. But wait, acetophenone is C6H5COCH3. Adding a hydroxyl group would change the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group. Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. Adding an -OH would make it C6H5CH(OH)CHO? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas again. Each option has 6 carbons. So it's a six-carbon compound. Let's think about possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation is 1. So one ring or one double bond. If it's a six-membered ring, like cyclohexane, but with two oxygen-containing groups. For example, a cyclohexane diol (two -OH groups). But that wouldn't have a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks. Or maybe one carbonyl and something else. Let me reevaluate the IR data. The very broad peak is at 3000—probably O-H. The 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl group. Wait, but 1700 is more likely a ketone or ester, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the structure has a benzene ring (aromatic), that would account for the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak (aromatic C=C stretch), and the 1700 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. The O-H at 3000 would be a phenol group.

So the structure might be a substituted phenol with a carbonyl group, such as a phenyl ketone. For example, 4-hydroxyacetophenone. That would have a benzene ring, a hydroxyl group, and a ketone. Let's think about the molecular formula.

Phenol is C6H5OH (C6H6O). Acetophenone is C6H5COCH3 (C8H8O). 4-Hydroxyacetophenone would be C6H5(OH)COCH3 → which is C8H8O2. But the molecular formulas given don't have 8 carbons. Wait, but the options only have 6 carbons. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the structure isn't a benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. Let's think: cyclohexenone has a ring with a double bond and a ketone. If there's a hydroxyl group attached, that would fit the data.

Wait, but cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Adding a hydroxyl group would make it C6H10O2. Looking at the options, that's option C. So let's see:

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So two degrees of unsaturation, which could be a ring (like cyclohexene) and a ketone.

So the structure could be cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. But cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Adding an -OH would make it C6H10O2.

FTIR: O-H (broad peak at 3000), carbonyl (1700), and the 1650 could be the ring's double bond. NMR would have vinyl hydrogens if there's a double bond, which cyclohexenone has. Mass spec fragment at 45—what could that be?

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12 +10 + 32= 72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114.

What fragments could give 45? Let's think about possible cleavages. If the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the ring breaks, maybe a fragment with 3 carbons could have a molecular weight of 45. But 3 carbons: C3H6O would be 3*12 +6 +16= 36+6+16=58. Alternatively, C2H5O would be 24+5+16=45. Wait, C2H5O has a molecular weight of 45 (2*12=24, 5*1=5, O=16 → 45). So a fragment with formula C2H5O would have m/z45.

How could the molecule cleave to form that? If the cyclohexenone ring breaks, perhaps in a way that a two-carbon fragment is formed. Wait, but cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond. Breaking the ring could release a smaller fragment. Alternatively, perhaps during the fragmentation, a two-carbon piece is lost.

Wait, another way: the molecule could lose a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one. For example, if the molecule loses C4H10O2, that's 4*12 +10 +32= 48+10+32=90. Then the remaining fragment would be C2H0O? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in ketones. McLafferty rearrangement produces a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. But I'm not sure if that would lead to a fragment at m/z45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z45 could correspond to a CH2=CHO+ group. Let me compute that. CH2=CHO has a molecular formula C2H3O. Molecular weight: 24 +3 +16=43. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COO+ (acetate ion) which is 60. No.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion), which is 58. No. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is an ester, and the ester group breaks off. Let's say the molecule is something like CH3O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH2-... No, that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let's think: a six-membered ring with a ketone and an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ortho ester. Or maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the mass spectrometry part. Let's think again. If the fragment is at m/z45, which is 45 amu. So what can fragment into that? Let me think about possible groups.

- (CH3)2CHO+ → 43. No.

- CH3COO+ → 60. No.

Wait, another approach: 45 is 12*3 +1*3 + 0 → 39? No. Wait, maybe O is involved differently. 45 could be CH3CH2O+ (45: 12*2 +6 +16= 24+6+16=46). No, that's 46. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Perhaps I should look for other clues. The presence of a broad O-H peak suggests either an alcohol or phenol. The FTIR peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest a carbonyl and possibly an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond.

In the options, options A and D have O, but only one O. Options B and C have O, with B being one O and C two O's.

Wait, but the FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000, which might indicate a phenol group (since phenol O-H is broad and around 3000). If it's a phenol, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group. Then, the presence of a carbonyl would imply another substituent on the ring—like a ketone group. But the molecular formula for phenol is C6H5OH (C6H6O). Adding a ketone would require more carbons, but our options have only six carbons.

Wait, but if the structure is a benzene ring with an -OH and a carbonyl group attached, that would require substituents. For example, benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group would be C6H5CHOH. The molecular formula would be C7H6O2. But that's not one of the options. So maybe it's not a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. So a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond, and an -OH. That would fit the molecular formula C6H10O2 (option C). Because cyclohexenone (C6H10O) plus an -OH would add another O, making it C6H10O2. But wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Adding an -OH (which replaces a H) would make it C6H9O2? Wait, no, adding an -OH would mean adding one O and one H? Wait, no: substituting a H with an -OH. So original formula for cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Adding an -OH would change it to C6H10O2, because O increases by one. Yes. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

So considering that, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond, explaining the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak), a ketone group (1700 cm⁻¹), and a hydroxyl group (the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹). That fits the IR data. The NMR would show vinyl protons from the double bond in the ring.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment at 45. Let's think about it again. If the molecule is C6H10O2, upon fragmentation, perhaps a two-carbon fragment is lost, leaving a four-carbon fragment? Or perhaps a smaller fragment forms.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's imagine it's a dihydroxy ketone, like a cyclohexenone diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexanone.

Wait, another idea: the fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a retro-aldol cleavage, breaking into two fragments. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecular weight is 114 (option C), and the fragment is 45. So 114 -45=69. So the molecule could break into a 45 and a 69 fragment. 69 could be a fragment with a molecular weight of 69. Hmm.

But I'm not entirely sure about the mass spec part. Maybe I should look for another clue.

Another point: the NMR shows vinyl protons, which are typically more downfield. So in a cyclohexenone, the double bond protons would resonate around δ 5-6, maybe. But without exact data, it's hard to say.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option C: C6H10O2. Because:

- The FTIR suggests O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and possibly an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond (1650). But wait, if it's cyclohexenone, the 1650 would be the ring's double bond, and the 1700 the ketone.

- The NMR has vinyl protons, indicating a double bond, which fits the cyclohexenone structure.

- The mass spec fragment at 45 could correspond to a two-carbon fragment, which might be possible with this structure.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone and an ester group. But that would complicate the formula.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2 could also be a diester or a cyclic ester (lactone). For example, a cyclic ester would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. But would that fit the IR data? The broad peak at 3000 might not fit unless there's an -OH, which a lactone doesn't have. So perhaps that's less likely.

So, based on the data:

- Broad O-H peak → likely an alcohol or phenol.

- 1700 cm⁻¹ → carbonyl.

- 1650 cm⁻¹ → double bond or aromatic ring.

- Vinyl protons in NMR → double bond.

So combining these, the structure likely has a carbonyl group, a double bond, and an -OH group. The molecular formula with two oxygen atoms (C6H10O2) would fit this scenario.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2.


The unknown compound's spectroscopic data provides several key clues:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a phenol or alcohol.  
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from a ketone or ester.  
   - A strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests a conjugated system, such as a double bond or aromatic ring.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a double bond) confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a fragment such as C₂H₅O.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
  Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This formula suggests one ring or one double bond. However, the FTIR data indicates two unsaturations (a carbonyl and a double bond or aromatic ring), making this option less likely.

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:  
  Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula allows for two unsaturations, such as a double bond and a carbonyl group. However, the FTIR data suggests the presence of an -OH group, which this formula does not account for.

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
  Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula accounts for two unsaturations, such as a double bond and a carbonyl group. The presence of two oxygen atoms also aligns with the broad -OH peak in the FTIR spectrum. A plausible structure is a cyclohexenone derivative with a hydroxyl group, which would explain the FTIR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data.

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:  
  Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. Similar to Option A, this formula suggests only one unsaturation, which does not match the FTIR data indicating two unsaturations.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent formula with the given data is **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This compound likely contains a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group, explaining the broad -OH peak, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the vinyl protons in the NMR spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 can also be rationalized with this structure.

Answer: C
