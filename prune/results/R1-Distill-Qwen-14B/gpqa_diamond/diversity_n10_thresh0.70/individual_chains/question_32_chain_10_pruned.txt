Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with particles moving at such high speeds, relativistic effects are important. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. I recall that the total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, what's the nucleus X in this question? Oh right, it's Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium-6 perhaps? Wait, no. Let me think: Li has atomic number 3, so if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's a total of 3 protons + 3 neutrons, making it lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6. So m is the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus.

But wait, particles in colliders are often considered as having mass equal to their rest mass energy. So I'll need the rest mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can use the molar mass and the number of nucleons to find the mass in kg.

Wait, the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, but that's per proton. So for each nucleon (proton or neutron), the rest mass energy is roughly 938 MeV. So for a nucleus with A nucleons, the rest mass energy would be approximately A * 938 MeV. But wait, that's a rough approximation because binding energy and other factors come into play. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can use this approximation.

So the nucleus X is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so A=6. So the rest mass energy is 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that.

6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but wait, I think that's an overestimation because the actual binding energy would reduce the total mass. But in this problem, maybe we're just supposed to take each nucleon as contributing 938 MeV, so the approximation is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, but in an exam setting, you might have to use approximate values.

But for the sake of this problem, I'll proceed with the approximation. So m = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me convert that into GeV: 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. So m≈5.628 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (binding energy). So the rest mass of Li-6 would be a bit less than 6 * 938 MeV. But I'm not sure if the problem expects that to be considered. Maybe it's okay to proceed with the approximate mass here.

So, the next step is to calculate the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The velocity v is given as 0.96c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt
