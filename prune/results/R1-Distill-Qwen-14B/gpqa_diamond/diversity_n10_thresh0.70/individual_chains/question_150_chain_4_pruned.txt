Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO undergoes a series of reactions. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The NMR data is provided, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll try to understand the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures that fit this.

Looking at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm: A triplet integrating for 1H. A triplet at around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So maybe it's part of an enal or something with adjacent CH2 groups. Or perhaps it's next to a double bond, like in a conjugated system.

- 6.98 ppm: A doublet integrating for 2H. This is in the aromatic region. The doublet could mean two equivalent aromatic protons with neighboring substituents. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings?

- 6.51 ppm: Another doublet for 2H. Also aromatic. So perhaps two sets of doublets indicating two different types of aromatic protons. Wait, or maybe these are two different aromatic rings, each with a doublet?

Wait, maybe it's a structure with two para-substituted benzene rings. The 6.98 and 6.51 might be two sets of two protons each on benzene rings. For example, each ring could have two doublets, perhaps indicating substitution at the para position.

Wait, but let me think more about the other peaks. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad suggests possible exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, in the NMR it's 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's a vinyl group or something else. Or maybe it's part of an aromatic ring but with some coupling.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. This is in the CH2 region. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a methylene next to a carbonyl.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecule has an aldehyde (from the 9.72 triplet), two aromatic rings (maybe each with substituents), and a methylene group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. Formula: C8H9NO. So, the general formula is CnHmOxNy.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y*2)/2. Hmm, wait, more accurately, each molecule contributes degrees as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Where X is halogens, but in this case, no X, so:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5 degrees of unsaturation. So five rings or double bonds.

Possible structures: maybe two rings (two benzene rings, each contributing 3 DoU, but wait, two benzene rings would be 3*2=6, which is more than 5. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, one benzene ring (3 DoU), one double bond (1), and a ring (maybe a five-membered ring?), but I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring (3), one double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde, which is a double bond between C and O). Wait, but aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's two DoU in the benzene and one in the aldehyde, and perhaps another double bond elsewhere.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's look at the NMR again.

The triplet at 9.72 (1H) as an aldehyde. So the structure must have an aldehyde group. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets for 2H each could be on a benzene ring. Maybe each is part of a para-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents. But the formula has more
