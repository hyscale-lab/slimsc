Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. The metric resembles something from hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in some coordinates. Let me recall. The Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²), right? But here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 minus (x² + y²), so maybe it's scaled.

If I factor out the 4, the denominator becomes 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/4), where r² is x² + y². So the metric becomes [32/(4(1 - r²/4))] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Wait, maybe I should convert it.

Wait, the given metric is in terms of dx² + dy², so let me write it in polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So substituting, the metric
