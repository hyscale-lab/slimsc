Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is a bit involved, so I need to parse all the information carefully.

First, let me read through the problem again to understand what's being asked. The problem gives a scenario with several substances reacting, and I need to figure out the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

The problem states: 

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsiusâ€”so maybe something that's a solid just above freezing. The product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Also, when calculating the cumulative atomic masses, if there are multiple isotopes, sum all the heavier and lighter ones.

So, let's take each part step by step.

First, let's identify what each substance could be based on the reactions and properties given.

Substance X is reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with equal protons and neutrons. So, each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about gases that fit this. Common gases include CO2, H2O, NH3, etc. Wait, but for a molecule, the total number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases.

The simplest would be something like CO2: each CO2 molecule has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22). But the number of neutrons in CO2 would depend on the isotopes. But wait, the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule as a whole has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like H2O. Each H2O molecule has 10 protons (2 H's and 8 O). The total number of neutrons would be the sum from
