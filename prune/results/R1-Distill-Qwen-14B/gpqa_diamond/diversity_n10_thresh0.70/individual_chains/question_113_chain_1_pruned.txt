Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound, and I've used three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me break down each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but the peak is very broad. For alcohols, the O-H stretch is usually a broad peak, but carboxylic acids are even broader, right? So maybe it's an -OH group, but not sure yet.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone (around 1715), an aldehyde (higher, maybe 1720), esters around 1740? Wait, esters are usually higher. Wait, no, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, the 1700 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring with conjugation. Oh wait, aromatic C=C stretches are around 1600-1680, so 1650 could be that. Or maybe an amide, but I don't see any info about nitrogen here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. So maybe an alkene is present.

The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could correspond to (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's
