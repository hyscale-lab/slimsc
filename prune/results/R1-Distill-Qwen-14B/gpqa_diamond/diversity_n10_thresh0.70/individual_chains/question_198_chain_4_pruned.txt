Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here. 

Alright, let's parse the problem. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, right? So β1 would be the constant for the first ligand, β2 for two, etc.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands attached. So that would correspond to the complex with two ligands, which would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. So the stability constant β2 is 40. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is for [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], β3 for [Co(SCN)_3], and β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]. So the dithiocyanato complex is the β2 one, with a stability constant of 40.

But wait, I think the stability constants might be for the stepwise formation. So βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand. Or is it the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands? Oh right, stability constants can be either stepwise (each step) or overall. But in this case, the way the problem is presented, I think each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is [Co(SCN)]^2+ / [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1. So the overall formation constant for each complex is given. 

The problem is about finding the percentage of the blue complexes, which are the dithiocyanate ones, so the [Co(SCN)_2^2+] concentration. So I need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that is this particular complex.

So, the approach would be to model the different species in solution. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible species. The possible species are Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^2+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. So that's five species, each with their own concentrations. 

The total concentration of Co is c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^2+.

But calculating each of these concentrations might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the formation of complexes step by step, considering the ligand concentrations and the stability constants.

Let me think about the distribution of the cobalt species.
