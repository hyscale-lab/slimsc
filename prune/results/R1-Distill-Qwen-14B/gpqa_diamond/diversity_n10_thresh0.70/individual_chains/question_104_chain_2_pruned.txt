Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves a little back and forth as the planet orbits it.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. So, both systems are similar in some ways—same star mass, same planet mass—but the RV shifts are different, and we need to find out how the orbital periods compare.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1's?

Wait, I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M planet) ) / ( (M star + M planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 day in seconds) )) ), but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the semi-amplitude formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p / M_star) )^(1/3)

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun's mass), the (1 + M_p/M_star) term approximates to M_star. So M_p/(M_star^(2/3)) becomes M_p/(M_star^(2/3)).

Wait, maybe there's a simpler way. The key thing is that the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 / sqrt(P)), but I might be mixing up terms. Alternatively, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (c * P^(1/3))) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the relation between K and the orbital period. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Or is it directly proportional?

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π G) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of the simplified version when M_p << M_star and circular orbit (so e=0). Then the formula simplifies.

In that case, K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (4π²) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe even better to write the formula as K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * c)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass
