Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

Alternatively, perhaps each state has its own uncertainty, and the energy difference needs to be larger than each of those. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. So ΔE > max(ħ/τ1, ħ/τ2).

Wait, because if the energy difference is larger than either state's uncertainty, then the peaks in the energy spectrum will be separated enough to see them as distinct. Because if the separation is less than the uncertainties, they might blend together.

So let's compute the energy uncertainties for each state.

Given:
τ1 = 1e-9 seconds
τ2 = 1e-8 seconds

Compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1
ΔE2 = ħ / τ2

But wait, since ħ is in J·s, and the options are in eV, I need to convert units. Let me calculate these values.

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So converting ħ to eV·s:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So now, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. That's 6.582
