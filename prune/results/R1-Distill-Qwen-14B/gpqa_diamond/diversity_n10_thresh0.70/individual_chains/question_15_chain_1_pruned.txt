Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the orbital inclination and the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, since shorter orbital period means it's nearer. Also, the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Oh, because if a more massive star has the same radius, it might be slightly smaller in terms of its size relative to its mass, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet.

I think the probability of a transit depends on two main factors: the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity is zero, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to P = R_star / a_planet.

Wait, but a_planet is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. So for each planet, I can find a_planet using Kepler's law. But since they're using the same host stars (but different masses?), wait, no, each planet is around a different star. So for each, I need to calculate a_planet based on their orbital periods and their respective stars' masses.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form a³ = (G(M_star + M_planet) * P²)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet is negligible. So a³ ≈ (G M_star) (P/(2π))². Or, more accurately, a³ = (G M_star) (P²/(4π²)).

But I'm not sure if I should use the version with P in seconds or another unit. But perhaps I can find the ratio between a1 and a2.

Wait, let's denote Planet_1 as P1 and
