Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Let me start by going through each of the given data points one by one and see what each tells me about the structure of the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids? Wait, but wait, the peak is very broad. Oh, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more easily. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but the peak might be a bit less broad. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, the FTIR has two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. What do those correspond to? Well, 1700 is a strong peak, often a carbonyl group (C=O). So that might be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. So maybe it's not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups? Or maybe an ester or an amide? But wait, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Wait, but in aromatic compounds, the C=C stretch is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, so 1650 is on the higher side. So perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1730-1750, but maybe in this case it's lower because of conjugation or something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's stretching, but I'm not certain.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group somewhere. So maybe an aromatic ring with double bonds? Or perhaps an isolated double bond, like in an ester group or something else. So that suggests that the compound has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with the carbonyl group, as that would explain the 1650 peak in IR. Wait, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So like an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, or maybe a ketone with a conjugated double bond.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me
