Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what it's asking. Alright, it says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just the potential energy probably.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So they're all sitting on a sphere with radius 2 meters around point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So that's the central charge, and the other 12 are around it.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D, with some numbers in scientific notation. Hmm. So I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy, since we're dealing with charges in an electrostatic configuration.

Wait, but wait. Since the system is isolated, the total energy would be the sum of all the potential energies between every pair of charges. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges from infinity to their current positions.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. Hmm, but wait, for point charges, the potential energy would depend on their arrangement. Since all except one are fixed at a distance of 2m from P, perhaps the configuration is symmetric. So maybe they're equally spaced around the central charge.

Wait, but the 12 charges are at 2m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2m from P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of these 12 charges is 2m away from the central charge. So the potential energy associated with each pair would be the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12.

Wait, but wait a second. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair (i,j), we calculate U_ij and sum them all.

But in this case, the 12 charges are identical, and each is at the same distance from the 13th. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 will be the same. So maybe I can calculate that first.

So each of the 12 charges has charge 2e, as does the central charge. So the charge at P is +2e each? Wait, but the problem says each has charge 2e. So all 13 are 2e. So the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e.

So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (2e * 2e) divided by (4πε₀ * r), where r is 2 meters. Wait, but each pair is between the central charge and the 12 others. So that's 12 pairs contributing the same amount.

So the potential energy for each of those 12 pairs would be (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2m). Since each pair contributes that, the total for these 12 is 12 times that.

But wait, wait. Wait, no. Because in the formula, U is (q1 q2)/(4πε₀ r), but in the case where one charge is fixed and the others are being placed around it, the potential energy added is q_i times the potential at that point due to all the other charges. Hmm, but actually, in the standard formula, the potential energy for a pair is mutual. So each pair contributes once.

So for the 12 pairs between the central charge and the surrounding charges, each pair contributes U = (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m). So that's 4e²/(4πε₀ * 2m) for each pair.

Wait, but wait, 4e² is (2e)^2, yes. So each pair contributes ( (2e)^2 ) / (4πε₀ * 2m) ) = (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) ) = e²/(2πε₀ m).

Wait, but wait, 4e² divided by 8πε₀ m. Because 4πε₀ * 2m is the denominator.

Wait, 4e² / (4πε₀ * 2m) ) = (e²) / (π ε₀ m) ) * (4/(4 * 2)) )? Wait, let me compute it again.

Wait, 4e² divided by (4πε₀ * 2m) ) equals (4e²)/(8π ε₀ m) ) = (e²)/(2π ε₀ m).

So each of the 12 pairs contributes e²/(2π ε₀ m), so the total for these 12 is 12 * e²/(2π ε₀ m) ) = (6 e²)/(π ε₀ m).

But wait, that's just the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12. But there are other potential energies as well. Because the 12 surrounding charges are all at the same distance, but they might also have potential energy between each other.

Ah, right. Because each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the central charge, but they are also at a certain distance from each other. So the potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges must also be considered.

Wait, but the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. So the distance between any two of them would depend on the angle between them. For example, two charges on the sphere would be separated by a distance d = 2 * 2m * sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between their positions as viewed from P. But if the charges are equally spaced, then each pair is as far apart as they can be, but wait, no, in reality, the minimum distance would be when the charges are as close as possible, but wait, perhaps for the minimum energy, the system's potential energy would be minimized when all the surrounding charges are as close as possible to each other, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but wait a minute. Electric potential energy between two positive charges is repulsive. So to minimize the energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. So the potential energy between them would be negative if they are opposite charges, but since all are positive, the potential energy would be positive, and to minimize the total, we'd want the potential energy between them to be as small as possible, which would mean the charges are as far apart as possible. So in that case, the minimum energy would be achieved when the 12 charges are placed as far apart as possible on the sphere, which would be the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something like that.

But actually, calculating the exact potential energy between all pairs is complicated, because each pair contributes a term of (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ d), where d is the distance between them. Since all the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two points on the sphere is given by the chord length: d = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between their position vectors from the center.

So the problem is that the potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. But to find the minimum energy, perhaps we can find an average distance or something. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified and only considers the potential energies between the central charge and the 12 others, not the interactions between the 12 themselves. Because sometimes, in such textbook problems, they neglect the interactions among the charges when they are fixed on a sphere, perhaps assuming that their potential energy between themselves is negligible compared to the other terms. Or maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge.

Wait, because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the other terms (between the 12 charges themselves) are positive, so including them would increase the total energy. But the question is about finding the minimum possible energy, so perhaps we can minimize the potential energy by considering only the central charge and the 12. Or perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible if they are all the same sign.

Wait, but wait, no. All charges are 2e, so same sign. So their mutual potential energies would be positive, meaning that the more they are spread out, the lower the potential energy between them. Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive, and it's higher when they're closer. So to minimize the total energy, you want them as far apart as possible. But how does that affect the potential energy? Because if they're spread apart, the potential energy would be lower (less positive), but it's still positive.

Wait, but if the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the total potential energy would arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, thus minimizing the sum of their mutual potential energies. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider just the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones, and not the interactions among the 12. Because that would make the problem much simpler. Hmm.

Let me read the question again. It says, "what is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" So perhaps the minimum energy is when the system's potential energy is as low as possible. Considering that all charges are positive, the potential energy between each pair is positive, so the more the pairs are spaced apart, the lower the energy. But the 12 on the sphere can't be arranged to be infinitely far apart, so perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, hence the charges are as spread out as possible.

But wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what's given. Each of the 12 surrounding charges is fixed at 2 meters from P, so their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m. The 13th is at P. So perhaps the mutual potential energies are fixed as well, because their positions are constrained. So maybe I don't have to compute the potential energies between the 12 charges because that's fixed, and the problem only requires the potential energies between each of the 12 and the central charge.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the mutual interactions would still contribute. For instance, each of the 12 charges would contribute to the potential energy of the others. But perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and not the mutual interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairs, so including the central charge with each of the 12, and the 12 choose 2 pairs for the surrounding charges.

So perhaps I need to compute both.

So let's break it down. The total potential energy U is the sum of U_central and U_surrounding.

U_central is the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges. Since each of these is 2e, the central charge is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (4e²)/(8πε₀ m) = e²/(2π ε₀ m).

But wait, I'm sorry, 4e² is (2e)^2, yes. So each pair contributes (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2m) = 4e²/(8πε₀ m) ) = e²/(2π ε₀ m). And there are 12 such pairs, so U_central = 12 * (e²/(2π ε₀ m)) ) = 6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Then, U_surrounding is the potential energy between each pair of surrounding charges. Each surrounding charge is 2e. The distance between two surrounding charges depends on their arrangement. Assuming they are placed symmetrically, perhaps at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but the exact calculation would be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that can't be because all charges are positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the central charge's interactions, and the surrounding charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual interactions cancel out, but that's only possible if their arrangement is such that the potential contributions are symmetrical and cancel each other out. But that's not possible for the potential energies between them, as they all contribute positive terms.

Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the interactions between the central charge and the surrounding ones. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated, and the options don't seem to take into account a very large number, which would be the case if all the 12 charges are close together. Let me think about the numbers.

The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. Let me compute the potential energy contributions to see which option matches.

First, compute U_central:

U_central = 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 π ε₀ * 2 m) )

Which is 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ m )

Simplify: 12 * (4/8) = 12 * 0.5 = 6.

So U_central = 6 e²/( π ε₀ m )

But wait, the denominator is 4πε₀ * 2m, right? So 4e² divided by (4πε₀ * 2m) is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m ). Then multiplied by 12, gives 6 e²/(pi ε₀ m )

Now, what's the value of e squared?

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

4πε₀ is approximately 1.11265e-10 N·m²/C².

So let me compute U_central.

U_central = 6 * (2.566e-38) / ( pi * 1.11265e-10 * 2 )

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is pi * epsilon_0 * m (2 meters).

Wait, no. Let me be precise.

U_central = 6 * e² / (pi * ε₀ * 2m) ) because the denominator is (4πε₀ * 2m) in each pair, but wait, no. Wait, each term is (4e²)/(8 pi ε₀ m) ), because 4e²/(4 pi ε₀ * 2m) ) = e²/(2 pi ε₀ m) per pair. So for 12 pairs, U_central = 12 * e²/(2 pi ε₀ m) ) = 6 e²/(pi ε₀ m).

Wait, yes.

So substituting numbers:

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approximately 2.566e-38 C².

pi = 3.14159.

epsilon_0 = 8.854e-12 F/m (C²/(N·m²)).

m is 2 meters.

So U_central = 6 * (2.566e-38) / ( 3.14159 * 8.854e-12 * 2 )

Let me compute the denominator first.

3.14159 * 8.854e-12 = 3.14159 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.781e-11.

Multiply by 2: 5.562e-11.

So U_central = 6 * 2.566e-38 / 5.562e-11.

Compute numerator: 6 * 2.566e-38 = 15.396e-38.

Divide by 5.562e-11: 15.396e-38 / 5.562e-11 = (15.396 /5.562) * 1e-27.

15.396 /5.562 ≈ 2.766.

So U_central ≈ 2.766e-27 J.

Wait, but wait. That's only the central charge's contribution. Now, what about the surrounding charges' mutual potential energy?

Each pair of the 12 surrounding charges contributes (2e)^2/(4 pi ε₀ d), where d is the distance between them. However, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute d. But perhaps if the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, each pair would have a certain average distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, considering that each is fixed on the sphere and their mutual distances are fixed, but that would complicate the problem a lot. So perhaps the intended solution is to compute only the central charge's potential energy with each of the 12, and not the mutual terms.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.766e-27 * 2.55. Hmmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the denominator in U_central is 4 pi ε₀ * 2m, but in each pair, the distance is 2m. So for each pair (central and surrounding), the distance is 2m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_central.

Wait, let's recalculate step by step.

Each pair between central and surrounding contributes:

U = (2e)(2e) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2m) ) = 4e² / (8 pi ε₀ m) ) = e²/(2 pi ε₀ m).

So each pair contributes e²/(2 pi ε₀ m).

12 pairs: 12 * e²/(2 pi ε₀ m) ) = 6 e²/(pi ε₀ m).

So U_central = 6 e²/(pi ε₀ m).

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers correctly.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

pi ≈ 3.14159.

epsilon_0 = 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

m = 2 meters.

So U_central = 6 * (2.566e-38) / (3.14159 * 8.854e-12 * 2 )

Wait, denominator is pi * epsilon_0 * 2m.

Wait, denominator = 3.14159 * 8.854e-12 * 2 = 3.14159 * 1.7708e-11 ≈ 5.56e-11.

So 6 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 15.396e-38.

15.396e-38 / 5.56e-11 = (15.396 /5.56) * 1e-27.

15.396 /5.56 ≈ 2.766, so 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger. Option A is 5.645e-26, also about 20 times larger. Option C is about 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times 2.766e-27, which is not exact. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, let me check the units. Oh wait! 4 pi ε₀ is in units of C²/(N·m²), so when you have e²/(4 pi ε₀ r), the units are (C²) * (N·m²/C²) ) / m = N·m²/m = N·m, which is joules. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate the denominator:

Denominator: pi * epsilon_0 * 2m.

pi ≈ 3.1416.

epsilon_0 ≈ 8.854e-12.

2m = 2 * 1 = 2 m.

So denominator: 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 = let's compute that.

3.1416 * 8.854e-12 = let's approximate.

8.854e-12 * 3 = 26.562e-12.

0.1416 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 1.253e-12.

So total ≈ 26.562e-12 + 1.253e-12 = 27.815e-12.

Multiply by 2: 55.63e-12 = 5.563e-11.

So denominator is 5.563e-11.

Numerator: 6 * e² =6 * 2.566e-38 =15.396e-38.

So 15.396e-38 / 5.563e-11 = (15.396 /5.563) * 1e-27.

15.396 /5.563 ≈ 2.766.

So U_central ≈ 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.77e-27 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, but that's about 2.55 times higher. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says each charge is 2e, but in my calculation, I used (2e)^2. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the number of pairs. Oh wait, no, the central charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let's compute it again.

Denominator: pi * epsilon_0 * 2m.

pi = 3.14159265.

epsilon_0 = 8.854187817e-12 F/m.

2m = 2*1 = 2 m.

So: 3.14159265 * 8.854187817e-12 = let's compute this.

3 * 8.854e-12 = 26.562e-12.

0.14159265 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 0.14159265 *8.854 ≈ 1.253e-12.

So 26.562e-12 + 1.253e-12 = 27.815e-12.

Multiply by 2: 55.63e-12 = 5.563e-11.

So denominator is 5.563e-11.

So 6e² =6 * 2.566e-38 =15.396e-38.

15.396e-38 / 5.563e-11 = (15.396 /5.563) * 1e-27.

15.396 /5.563 ≈ 2.766.

So U_central ≈ 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times bigger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's see what that would contribute.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the center. The distance between any two surrounding charges can be found by considering the chord length, which is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between their position vectors. If the charges are equally spaced around the sphere, the angle theta between any two adjacent charges (as seen from the center) would be around 360/12 = 30 degrees? No, wait, because in 3D, the number of points on a sphere can't be equally spaced in a way that each has the same theta. Alternatively, perhaps in the most symmetrical arrangement, like a regular icosahedron, but that's complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of surrounding charges is placed diametrically opposite, but that's only possible if there are 6 pairs, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy can be neglected, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, the average distance between them would be larger, leading to a smaller potential energy (but still positive, since all are positive).

In that case, the mutual potential energy would be a positive contribution, making the total energy higher than just the U_central term. So the minimum energy would include this.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the intended solution is to compute only the central charge's contribution, and the answer would be approximately 2.77e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering all 13 charges contributing to each other, but since one is fixed, perhaps the mutual potential energies are being considered for all pairs except those involving the central charge.

Wait, no, that's not the case. The central charge is fixed, and the other 12 are constrained, so all pairs involving the central charge are considered, and all pairs among the 12 are considered.

But perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, without the mutual terms. So the answer would be 2.766e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me see if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair's potential energy is (2e)(2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 r), which is (4e²)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2 m) ) = e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m) ) per pair. Then, 12 pairs would be 12 * e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m) ) = 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ).

Wait, let me compute this again.

e^2 = (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

6 * 2.566e-38 = 15.396e-38.

Denominator: pi * epsilon_0 * m.

pi ≈3.1416.

epsilon_0 =8.854e-12.

m=2 m.

So denominator: 3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2= 3.1416 * 1.7708e-11 ≈ 5.56e-11.

So 15.396e-38 /5.56e-11 = 2.766e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy is actually (q1 q2)/(4 pi epsilon_0 r), and I used 4 pi epsilon_0 r as the denominator.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So each pair's potential energy is (2e)(2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m) = 4e²/(8 pi epsilon_0 m) ) = e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m).

So 12 pairs: 12 * e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m ) = 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m).

Ah, wait, wait, because m is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2 m, so perhaps it's 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m) ) ?

Wait no, because it's 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m), but m is 2 m. So denominator is pi epsilon_0 * 2 m.

Wait, so 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m) ) = 3 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Each term is (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m) ) = 4e^2/(8 pi epsilon_0 m ) = e^2/(2 pi epsilon_0 m) per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * e^2/(2 pi epsilon_0 m ) = 6 e^2/(pi epsilon_0 m).

So U_central = 6 e^2/(pi epsilon_0 m ).

Ah, because m is 2 m, so it's 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2) ) = 3 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 1 m).

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me re-express:

U_central = 6 * (e^2) / (pi * epsilon_0 * 2 m )

Because m is 2 meters.

Wait, no. m is 2 meters, but in the denominator, it's 4 pi epsilon_0 r, where r is 2 m.

Wait, perhaps I have to re-examine the expression.

Each pair's potential energy: (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 * r ), where r is 2 m.

So (4e²) / (4 pi epsilon_0 * 2 m ) = (e²) / (pi epsilon_0 * 2 m ) per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m ) ) = (6 e²) / (pi epsilon_0 m ).

So U_central =6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Because m is 2, so 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 )

So 3 e²/(pi epsilon_0 )

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 m ) = 3 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck in the variables. Let me just plug in the numbers again.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = 2.566e-38 C².

pi = 3.14159.

epsilon_0 = 8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

r = 2 m.

U_central = 12 * ( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi epsilon_0 r )

= 12 * (4 e²)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2 m )

Simplify: 12 * (4 e²) / (8 pi epsilon_0 m )

= 12 * e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )

= (12/2) * e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

= 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Ah, now substituting:

e² =2.566e-38 C².

pi epsilon_0 m = 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 F/m * 2 m.

So pi epsilon_0 m = 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 = 3.1416 * 1.7708e-11 ≈5.56e-11.

So U_central =6 * 2.566e-38 /5.56e-11.

Compute numerator:6 *2.566e-38=15.396e-38.

15.396e-38 /5.56e-11 = approx 2.766e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. The closest is C, which is 7.056e-27 J.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the central charge is 2e, and the 12 are 2e, so each pair is (2e)(2e), correct. So 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each pair as contributing twice, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the central charge, but the central charge is fixed, so the work done is only for bringing each charge from infinity to 2m away.

In that case, the potential energy for each surrounding charge is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at point P due to the central charge.

Wait, that's another approach. The potential at P due to the central charge is V = (2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 0 ), but wait, that's undefined because the potential at a point charge is infinite. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps this approach isn't applicable.

Alternatively, another way to compute the potential energy of the system is to consider the work done in assembling the charges. So, place the central charge first (no work needed). Then bring each of the 12 charges from infinity to 2m away. The potential at 2m is due to the central charge only, which is (2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m). So each charge contributes work dW = q * V = (2e) * (2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m) ) = (4e²)/(8 pi epsilon_0 m )= e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m ).

So 12 charges: 12 * e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m ) )=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ), which is the same as before.

So that's the same calculation. So perhaps the problem only wants this term, ignoring the mutual potential energies.

But the options don't have 2.77e-27 J. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2 cm instead of 2 meters? Because the options have much larger values. Let me check the question. Oh, the distance is 2 meters. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ) =6 * (1.602e-19)^2 / (3.1416 * 8.854e-12 * 2 )

Compute numerator: 6 * (2.566e-38) )=1.5396e-37.

Denominator:3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 =5.563e-11.

So 1.5396e-37 /5.563e-11 = 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher than 2.76e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Oh wait, perhaps there are 13 charges, so the 12 surrounding plus the central.

Wait no, the central is fixed. The 12 are moving. So the mutual potential between the 12 is another term.

Assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something with each pair at the same distance. Let's assume that all pairs are at the same distance. Wait, but in 3D, you can't have 12 points all equidistant from each other on a sphere. So that's not possible. So perhaps the average distance can be considered as the same for all pairs, but that's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to only include the central charge's interactions, and the mutual interactions are zero. That doesn't make sense, but perhaps it's a trick question.

But given that the calculated U_central is 2.77e-27 J and the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each mutual pair contributes twice, because each pair is counted once when considering the central charge. No, the mutual pairs are separate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would require the potential energy to be as negative as possible. But all charges are positive, so bringing them close would result in higher positive potential energy. Wait, no, positive charges repel, so bringing them closer would require work, increasing the potential energy. So the minimum energy would be achieved when the charges are as far apart as possible, which would be when they are on a sphere with maximum possible separation. But in this problem, their separation is fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distance isn't fixed.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy's contribution is negligible compared to the central charge's term, so the answer is approximately 2.77e-27 J. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central one, and each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m), leading to 12*(4e²)/(8 pi epsilon_0 m) )= 12*(e²)/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ), which is what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the problem statement, the 12 charges are constrained to be 2 meters from P, so their distance is fixed, but their mutual distances are not fixed. So the mutual potential energy is not fixed and depends on their arrangement. So to find the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, thus making the mutual U as small as possible (but still positive).

But again, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute the mutual U.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible with same-sign charges.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for the 13 charges, each pair contributes.

The central charge is 2e, and the 12 surrounding are 2e each.

So the number of pairs is:

Central charge with each of the 12: 12 pairs.

Between the 12 surrounding charges: C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each of these pairs contributes (2e)(2e)/(4 pi epsilon_0 d), where d is the distance between them.

But as I said earlier, without knowing d, it's hard to compute. But perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the central charge's interactions.

In that case, the total U would be 12 * (4e²)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m) )= 12 * e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ).

Which is 2.77e-27 J, as before.

But again, that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, the options are given in Joules, correct to three decimals. Let me see option B: 2.822e-26 J. That's about 10 times higher than my calculation. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the exponent?

Wait, 2e is 2 times elementary charge. So, e=1.6e-19 C.

So (2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*(2.56e-38)=1.024e-37 C².

Wait, no, 1.6e-19 squared is 2.56e-38. So 4e² is 1.024e-37 C².

Wait, but in the U_central calculation, I used e² as 2.566e-38 C², which is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all 13 charges, including the mutual interactions. Let me compute the mutual potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges.

Assuming that each pair is equally distant, the average distance can be approximated. For a sphere of radius r, the average distance between two points is (something).

Wait, the average distance between two random points on a sphere of radius r is (3r)/(pi). So for r=2 m, average d = (3*2)/(pi) ≈ 1.91 m.

But this is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the average chord length is (4r)/(pi).

Wait, the average chord length between two random points on a sphere of radius r is (4r/3). Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check.

Wait, I think the average chord length is (4r)/pi. So for r=2m, average d= (4*2)/pi ≈ 2.546 m.

Hmm. So each mutual pair would be separated by about 2.546 m on average.

So each mutual pair's potential energy would be (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2.546) )=4e²/(10.184 pi epsilon_0) ).

So 4e²/(10.184 pi epsilon_0) ) = (4e²)/(31.96 epsilon_0) ).

But with 66 pairs, the total mutual U would be 66 * (4e²)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2.546 m ) ) = 66 * (4e²)/(10.184 pi epsilon_0 m ) ) = 66 * (4e²)/(10.184 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 m )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the units.

Wait, perhaps the mutual U is 66 * (4e²)/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2.546 m ) )=66 * e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2.546 m ) ).

e² is 2.566e-38.

So mutual U =66 * 2.566e-38/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.546 *2 m )

Wait, denominator:3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.546 *2 m.

Wait, 3.1416 *8.854e-12 =2.781e-11.

2.781e-11 *2.546 =7.077e-11.

7.077e-11 *2=1.415e-10.

So mutual U =66 * 2.566e-38/(1.415e-10 )

=66 * (2.566e-38 /1.415e-10 )

=66 * 1.814e-28.

=1.200e-26 J.

That's about 1.2e-26 J.

But then, adding this to the U_central of 2.77e-27 J gives a total of approximately 1.48e-26 J.

But none of the options match this either. So perhaps the mutual term is negligible compared to the central term, but in this case, it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual term is negative, which would lower the total energy, but since all charges are positive, mutual U is positive.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to only consider the central charge's interactions, resulting in 2.77e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute U_central again.

U_central =12 * (2e * 2e) / (4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m )

=12 *4 e²/(8 pi epsilon_0 m )

=12 * e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )

=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Now, substitute the numbers:

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²=2.566e-38 C².

pi=3.1416.

epsilon_0=8.854e-12 F/m.

m=2 m.

So U_central=6 *2.566e-38/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 )

Compute denominator:3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 =5.563e-11.

So U_central=6*2.566e-38/5.563e-11=15.396e-38/5.563e-11=2.766e-27 J.

Hmm.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me compute 3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.

3.1416 *8.854e-12 =3.1416 *8.854e-12≈27.81e-12.

Multiply by 2:55.62e-12=5.562e-11.

So denominator is correct.

So perhaps the problem wants the answer to be approximately 2.77e-27 J, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, the problem states 13 particles, each with charge 2e. So 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term with the central charge.

So 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge is 2e, and each of the surrounding is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 * 2m) ), and 12 pairs give U_central =12*(4e²)/(8 pi epsilon_0 m )= 12*(e²)/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ).

Wait, with m=2, then U_central=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2 )=3 e²/(pi epsilon_0).

So 3 * (1.602e-19)^2/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 )

Compute numerator:3*(2.566e-38)=7.698e-38.

Denominator:3.1416 *8.854e-12≈2.781e-11.

So U_central=7.698e-38 /2.781e-11=2.766e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given that the calculated value isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total potential energy, including both the central charge and the mutual terms, and the mutual terms are much larger. But without knowing the mutual distances, maybe the problem is designed to ignore them, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual terms, and the correct answer isn't listed, but from the options, perhaps option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times larger than my calculated 2.77e-27 J. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2 cm instead of 2 meters. Let me check the problem statement again. It says 2 m from P. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law is F = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q1 q2)/r². The potential energy U is (q1 q2)/(4 pi epsilon_0 r ), correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges being fixed, so the work done is only for bringing each charge to 2m from the central charge, which is what I did.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 2.77e-27 J. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but among the options, the closest is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.55 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher. But I can't find where I might have missed a factor of 10.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem statement says 2e, but I considered each charge as 2e, but the actual charges are +2e each, so when calculating the potential energy between the central charge and a surrounding one, it's (2e)(2e) =4e², but perhaps I should have considered (2e)(e), but no, the central charge is 2e as well.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e². Let me recompute e².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approx 2.56697e-38 C².

So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Given that the calculation leads to approximately 2.77e-27 J and the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is 2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how that would be achieved.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for epsilon_0, such as 8.85e-12 instead of 8.854e-12. Let me see.

If epsilon_0 is taken as 8.85e-12, then:

denominator:3.1416 *8.85e-12 *2=3.1416 *1.77e-11=5.56e-11.

Same as before. So it doesn't change the result.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes twice, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 0.2 m instead of 2 m. Let me check the problem statement again. It says 2 m. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended solution is to compute only the central charge's contribution, resulting in 2.77e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B) 2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times higher, and I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using meters incorrectly. Let me check the units again.

Wait, 1/(4 pi epsilon_0) has units of N·m²/C².

So when calculating U, the units are (C^2) * (N·m²/C²) ) / m = N·m = J.

So the units are correct.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.55 times the calculated U_central.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ), where m=2. So 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 2) ) =3 e²/(pi epsilon_0 ).

So 3*2.566e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12) )=7.698e-38 /2.781e-11=2.766e-27 J.

Hmm.

After spending a lot of time, I think the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how that would be derived. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mutual potential energy to be included, leading to a higher value. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge's potential energy is 12*(2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 *2m ), which is 12*(4e²)/(8 pi epsilon_0 m )=12*(e²)/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )=6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ), which is 2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm. I think I'll go with the calculation I did. The answer should be approximately 2.77e-27 J, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.82e-26 J, but I can't figure out why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the central charge is 1, and there are 12 surrounding charges. So the number of pairs involving the central charge is 12. The number of mutual pairs among the 12 is (12 *11)/2 =66. So the total number of pairs is 78. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute their contributions.

In the end, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.82e-26 J, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges arranged in a regular polygon. For example, 12 charges on a circle of radius 2m around point P. Then, the distance between adjacent charges would be 2m * sin(pi/6) =2m *0.5=1m.

So the distance between adjacent charges would be 1m. The potential energy between each pair would be (2e)^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 *1m )=4e²/(4 pi epsilon_0 *1 )=e²/(pi epsilon_0 ).

So each mutual pair contributes e²/(pi epsilon_0 ), and there are 12 such pairs (in a regular 12-gon, each charge has two neighbors, but each pair is counted once, so 12/2=6 pairs? Wait, no, in a 12-gon, each adjacent pair is unique, so 12 pairs. Wait, no, for a regular polygon with n sides, there are n adjacent pairs, but each pair is counted once, so 12 pairs.

Wait, no. For a regular 12-gon, there are 12 edges, each between two adjacent charges, so 12 pairs at 1m apart.

So the mutual potential energy would be 12 * (e²/(pi epsilon_0 )) ).

Wait, but each mutual pair is only the adjacent ones, but in reality, the charges are on a sphere, so the mutual distances vary. But perhaps the problem is considering only the adjacent pairs.

So mutual U would be 12 * (e²/(pi epsilon_0 )) ).

Additionally, the central charge's U is 12*(e²/(2 pi epsilon_0 m )) ), which is 6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m ).

Hmm. But this approach would give a different result. Let me compute.

Mutual U (adjacent pairs only):12 * e²/(pi epsilon_0 * 1m )=12 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Central U:6 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )

Total U:18 e²/(pi epsilon_0 m )=18 *2.566e-38/(3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 )

Denominator:3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2=5.563e-11.

18 *2.566e-38=4.619e-37.

4.619e-37 /5.563e-11=8.300e-27 J.

But this is an approximation, and the answer isn't any of the options. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

After spending a lot of time and not finding a matching option, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation, and the correct answer is option C.

But based on the calculation, the U_central is approximately 2.77e-27 J, which is not an option. Therefore, I'm probably missing something, but I can't figure it out. I'll have to go with option B, 2.822e-26 J, perhaps because it's the only one in the same order of magnitude, but I'm not certain.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the system, which includes contributions from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 surrounding charges. The problem specifies that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at a fixed distance of 2 m from the central charge, but their mutual distances are not explicitly given. 

### Step 1: Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Surrounding Charges
Each surrounding charge has a charge of \( 2e \), and the central charge also has a charge of \( 2e \). The potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is given by:

\[
U_{\text{central}} = \frac{(2e)(2e)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \cdot 2m} = \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 m} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 m}.
\]

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy contributed by these interactions is:

\[
U_{\text{total, central}} = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 m} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0 m}.
\]

Substituting the known values:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),
- \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \),
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N·m}^2) \),
- \( m = 2 \, \text{m} \),

we compute:

\[
U_{\text{total, central}} = \frac{6 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{\pi \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 2}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
\pi \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 2 = 5.563 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Then, calculate the numerator:

\[
6 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 1.5396 \times 10^{-37}.
\]

Finally, divide:

\[
U_{\text{total, central}} = \frac{1.5396 \times 10^{-37}}{5.563 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.766 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Surrounding Charges
The mutual potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges depends on their arrangement. Assuming the charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the average distance between two charges can be approximated. However, the exact calculation of mutual potential energy is complex due to the need to account for all pairwise distances. For simplicity, this contribution is not explicitly calculated in the analysis.

### Step 3: Total Potential Energy
The total potential energy of the system includes both the energy from the central charge and the mutual energy between the surrounding charges. Since the mutual energy is not explicitly calculated, the focus remains on the contribution from the central charge, which is approximately \( 2.77 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 4: Comparison with Options
The calculated value of \( 2.77 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 2.55 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or an oversight in the interpretation of the mutual potential energy contribution.

### Conclusion
Given the available options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, as it is the closest to the calculated value, despite the discrepancy.

**Answer: C**
