Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. We're given the initial volumes and concentrations, and we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each providing two pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Diluting it would change the concentration.

Wait, the first thing I should do is calculate the new concentration after dilution. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes according to the formula C1V1 = C2V2. So C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³ after adding 20 cm³ of water. So C2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no—wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.

Now, the titration is done with 0.1 M NaOH. So at 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? Let's think.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So first, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.025 M is 0.025 moles per liter. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH (which is a strong base) will be 0.001 moles as well. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

So at 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of 10 cm
