Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about an electron's spin state and some operator. The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional means it's just a scalar multiple, right? So I probably need to normalize it first.

Hmmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors have to be normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves should be 1. So I need to calculate the magnitude squared of each coefficient and sum them up to find the normalization factor.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let's compute their magnitudes squared. The magnitude of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b².

For the first coefficient (1+i), |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
For the second (2 - i), |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.
Adding them gives 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the state is normalized now.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, because the spin is up or down, so two states.

Let me write out the matrix A. Since it's 2x2, the indices go from 1 and 2. So for i=1, j=2: A_12 = ħ/2, and A_21= ħ/2. All the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Hmm, wait, that's an anti-diagonal matrix. So the operator has eigenstates different from |up> and |down>, perhaps? Because the standard basis is |up> and |down> for spin z-component.

I think the operator A is given by this matrix, so the eigenstates are probably the eigenstates of this particular operator, not the z-projection. So the eigenstates of A are not |up> and |down>, but some other states.

So the problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring the electron in the eigenstates of operator A, which are not the standard spin up and down states.

Wait, but wait: the question says, "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So the eigenstates of A are the new basis we should express |alpha> in, to find the probabilities.

So the first step is to find the eigenstates of A.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Which is a 2x2 matrix. Let's find its
