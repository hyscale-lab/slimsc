Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to figure out where this is located geometrically. I think the options are in terms of coordinates in some space, maybe Bloch sphere coordinates or something similar.

Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and it's related to the density matrix. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to points on the Bloch sphere. Specifically, |0⟩ is at (1, 0, 0) and |1⟩ is at (-1, 0, 0), if I recall correctly. But wait, no, maybe |0⟩ is at (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,1) or something. Wait, no, I think |0⟩ is at (1,0,0), |1⟩ is at (-1,0,0). Or was it (0,0,1) for |1⟩? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the Bloch sphere representation. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. The given ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with probability 1/2. So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

The density matrix can be written as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So this is an equal mixture of the two basis states. Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think the Bloch vector for a mixed state is given by certain components derived from the density matrix.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So expanding that, ρ = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2.

Let's compute that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the Pauli matrices are σx=[[0,1],[1,0]], σy=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σz=[[1,0],[0,-1]].

Given our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute |0⟩⟨0| : that's [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So (1/2)(I) is ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. So substituting into the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, we have (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that (I + r·σ) must equal I. So r·σ must be zero matrix. Because I + r·σ equals I multiplied by 2 times (I/2) would give I. Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

Given ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, and our ρ is I/2, so I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. So r·σ is the zero matrix. What does that mean for r?

r·σ is xσx + yσy + zσz. For this to be zero for all terms, each coefficient must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is linearly independent. So x=0, y=0, z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but wait. The Bloch sphere has all pure states on its surface, and the completely mixed state is at the origin. So yeah, the density matrix being I/2 corresponds to r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1|).
\]

This represents a mixed state that is an equal statistical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = x\sigma_x + y\sigma_y + z\sigma_z\).

For the given \(\rho\), we compute \(|0\rangle\langle 0|\) and \(|1\rangle\langle 1|\), which are the diagonal matrices \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), respectively. Adding these gives the identity matrix \(I\), so 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), we find that 

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
