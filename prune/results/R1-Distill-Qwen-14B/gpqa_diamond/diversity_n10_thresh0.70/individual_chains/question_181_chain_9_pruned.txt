Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. Oh wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain.

So, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, right? But I'm not exactly sure how. I think the main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-I branch. But pp-III might be a part that contributes less or under different conditions.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. So if it stops, that means that a certain part of the neutrino production is halted. But how does that affect the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth?

The question asks about the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to find Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) after the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1 MeV or so. Oh, because the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into carbon-12, which emits two protons, and that process releases a lot of energy. So the neutrinos from pp-III would have higher energies.

Wait, but
