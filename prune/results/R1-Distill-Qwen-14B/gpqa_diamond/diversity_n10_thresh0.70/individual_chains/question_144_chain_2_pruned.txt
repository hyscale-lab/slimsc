Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various numbers.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula involves the lifetime and the speed of the particle, or maybe the velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βγc), but wait, no—actually, the mean decay distance is the average speed multiplied by the lifetime. Or wait, more accurately, the mean decay length is (βc) * τ, where β is v/c, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But to get τ, I need the particle's lifetime. The lifetime is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Because the width Γ is the energy uncertainty ΔE, and the uncertainty in time Δt is ħ/(ΔE). So τ, the mean lifetime, is approximately ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but I have to be careful with units. Let me jot down the formula. The mean proper lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the total width Γ is the total
