Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The task is to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the potential energy between point charges is calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for potential energy (U) between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

Wait, but in this case, there are multiple charges. So, I think I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair of charges and then sum them all up. Because each charge contributes to the potential energy of the others.

Let me think: There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But what about the distance between each other? Since they are all at 2 m from P, I imagine they form a sphere around P. So, each of the 12 is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. But are they all at the same point? No, because they're constrained to stay at a distance of 2 m, so they can be anywhere on the surface, but the distance between any two of them would vary unless they're all at the same spot, which isn't allowed because that would cause overlap and infinite potential energy. So, wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m—does that mean their positions are fixed, but they can be anywhere on that sphere? So, their mutual distances can vary, but for the minimum energy, maybe they arrange themselves to be as close as possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. The problem
