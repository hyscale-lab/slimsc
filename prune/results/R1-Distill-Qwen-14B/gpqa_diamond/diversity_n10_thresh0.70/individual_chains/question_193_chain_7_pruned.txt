Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, which involve different powers of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. Or wait, wait, no: more accurately, distance d (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax (they appear to move more), so if plx is small, d is large.

So if I have d = 1/plx, then plx is 1/d. So let's substitute plx in terms of d. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx = 1/d, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent: (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh wait, wait—because when we talk about the number of stars in a range of distance, we're considering a thin shell between r and r+dr, perhaps. So we need to find the number of stars as a function of r, and then see how it scales with r.

So N ∝ d^5. But wait, no, that can't be right. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases. But that doesn't make sense, because more distant stars would be fewer in number. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait the question says "the
