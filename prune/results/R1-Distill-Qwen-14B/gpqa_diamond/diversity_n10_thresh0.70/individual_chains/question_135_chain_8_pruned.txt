Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Let me parse this.

So the Lagrangian looks like it's describing an interaction between the boson field X and some fermion fields ψf. The term λf is probably a coupling constant. The structure of the Lagrangian suggests that X is interacting with fermions ψf, and the interaction is proportional to X(y) times ψf and ψf̄.

Wait, fermions are the matter particles like electrons, quarks, etc. So the boson X is interacting with these fermions. The interaction term might be written as X ψψ, implying a coupling that allows X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄. But which fermions are allowed? That depends on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent particle must be at least twice the mass of the daughter particles for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

Now, what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV each? Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV. So 2e would be negligible, definitely allowed.

Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV. So 2μ's mass is 0.2 GeV, way under 6.

Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV. So 2τ would be 3.56 GeV. So X can decay into ττ̄.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Let's see their masses.

Wait, the masses for quarks are a bit tricky because they're given in different ways—current masses. But I think the approximate masses are:

u: ~1 MeV (so negligible)
d: ~3 MeV (also negligible)
s: ~95 MeV (so 0.095 GeV)
c: ~1.2 GeV
b: ~4.5 GeV
t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So for X to decay into quark-antiquark pairs, the pair's mass must be less than or equal to X's mass, which is 6 GeV.

Looking at the quarks:

- u and d: their masses are negligible, so 2m ≈ 0, so they can definitely be produced. So X can decay into
