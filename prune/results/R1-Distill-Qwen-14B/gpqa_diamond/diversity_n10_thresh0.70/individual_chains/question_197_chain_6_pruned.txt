Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, I need to figure out what the product is when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's see what data I've got.

First, looking at the IR data: it shows strong peaks around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, since the other options don't seem to have amines, maybe it's an O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is present here. Oh, but wait, the IR also has a peak at 1450 cm-1, which might be from a carbonyl adjacent to an aromatic ring, like in a ketone or maybe an acyl group attached to something else. Also, the 1610 cm-1 could be C=C aromatic stretching.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an O-H proton. So maybe a carboxylic acid group. Because if it were an alcohol, the peak would be around 1-5 ppm
