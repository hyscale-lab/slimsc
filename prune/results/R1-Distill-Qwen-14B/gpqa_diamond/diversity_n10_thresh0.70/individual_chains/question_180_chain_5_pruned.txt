Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with electric potential energy, the key is to consider each pair of charges and calculate the potential energy between them. Since the system is isolated, I think the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, the system is isolated, so it doesn't interact with anything else, but the charges themselves are interacting. So each charge contributes to the potential energy of the system. But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, the other 12 are fixed at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, which has the 13th charge.

Let me think about the setup. There are 13 charges in total. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So for the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, that's 12 interactions. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay 2 meters from P. But are they allowed to move relative to each other? The problem says they are constrained, but it doesn't specify if they can move closer to each other or not. Oh, wait, if they are all at 2 meters from P, but the distance between each other isn't specified. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2m from P, but how about their distance from each other? If they are all at a fixed radius from P, they could be arranged in a spherical shell, but their exact positions might not matter for the potential energy because each pair among them contributes to the total.

Wait, but calculating the potential energy between all pairs would involve all the combinations of the 12 charges. Because each pair contributes to the potential energy, which is an additive quantity.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So let's think about this. For a system of N point charges, the total electric potential energy is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where the sum is over all i < j.

But in this case, some of the charges are at different positions. There are two groups: the 13th charge at P and the 12 charges at 2m away.

So each
