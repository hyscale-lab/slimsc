Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I should probably figure out the energy difference between the states and then use that to find the photon's momentum.

Wait, the molecule is modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, that's often called the non-rigid rotor model because it considers both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state (v=1) because increasing the vibrational state would contribute more energy than just increasing the rotational state. Or wait, maybe not. Because sometimes the rotational energy levels can be closer together. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule needs to absorb a photon that causes it to transition to the next energy level. The next energy level after the fundamental state is either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the photon's momentum, so I need to find the energy of the photon.

I think that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one has a lower energy? Well, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The vibrational energy for v=1 would be higher than the rotational energy for J=1, I think, because the vibrational energy depends on the bond's angular frequency, which is typically higher than rotational energy.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, and rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So
