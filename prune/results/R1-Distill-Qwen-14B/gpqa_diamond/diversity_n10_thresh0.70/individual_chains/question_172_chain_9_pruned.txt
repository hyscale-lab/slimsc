Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Okay, let's break it down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I remember that excitation refers to the energy levels of atoms. When atoms are excited, they have higher energy. But how does this relate to the stars' temperatures?

Wait, it's mentioned that the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I can use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann distribution tells us about the population of different energy levels in a system in equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E is the energy difference between two levels, E_i and E_j. But wait, the problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. Does that mean the ratio of excited atoms is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2?

So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. The problem says n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Because if star_1 has higher excitation, perhaps more atoms are in the higher energy state. So if the ground state is j and the excited state is i, then n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, or maybe the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) for each star.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the ratio of n_i to n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Suppose for star_1, the population in the excited state is higher. So for each star, the ratio n_i / n_j is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) multiplied by (g_i/g_j). Similarly for star_2, (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) times (g_i/g_j).

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Does that mean that the population ratio is twice? Let me think. If more atoms are excited, then the ratio n_i/n_j would be higher. So if in star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2, then (n_i1/n_j1) = 2*(n_i2/n_j2). 

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the way. Let me rephrase. Let’s denote the ratio for each star as (n_i/n_j) for star 1 is R
