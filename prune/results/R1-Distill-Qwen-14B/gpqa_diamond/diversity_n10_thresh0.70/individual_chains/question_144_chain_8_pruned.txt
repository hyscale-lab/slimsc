Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances.

Wait, what do I remember about decay distances? Oh right, the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), so d = βcτ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right, from the uncertainty principle or the Heisenberg's principle. The lifetime is related to the width Γ by τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, which is inversely related to the lifetime—so the broader the peak, the shorter the lifetime.

But wait, the width Γ is given in MeV, so I'll need to convert that into units compatible with Planck's constant. Let me recall, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 0.32 GeV because 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let
