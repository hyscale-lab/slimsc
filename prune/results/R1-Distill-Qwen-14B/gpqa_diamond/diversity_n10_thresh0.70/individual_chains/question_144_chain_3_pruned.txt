Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time, and the mean decay distance depends on how long it lives and how fast it's moving. But wait, how do I calculate that?

Oh right, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width Γ. I think the formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, wait, I've heard that the width Γ is related to the uncertainty principle. So yes, Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the mean lifetime. So that part makes sense.

But wait, the problem gives Γ in MeV. Oh yeah, because energy units are involved here. So I need to convert Γ into appropriate units when using it in τ.

But wait, there's another thing—relativistic motion. The particle's speed is going to be a factor because the distance it travels before decaying depends on how fast it's moving. So the mean decay length L is the product of the velocity (v) times the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But how
