Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand the question correctly.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And they remind us that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking about how light speed works in different media and how motion affects it. I remember that in a medium like glass, the speed of light is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. So normally, without any movement, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n because c is 1. But here, the glass itself is moving, so that's adding another layer.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. So, the glass is moving in the same direction the light is propagating. But since the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them, I think I need to consider relative velocities here.

I'm a bit confused about how the glass moving affects the speed of light in it. From what I remember, the speed of light in a moving medium isn't simply additive with the medium's velocity because of relativity. Wait, but the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe I don't have to deal with relativistic effects like length contraction or time dilation here. Or do I?

Wait, no. I think in classical mechanics, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, the speed of something in the medium would be v_medium + v_light_in_medium. But wait, that's not quite right because light's speed isn't just additive that way. Oh wait, this is probably a scenario where Galilean addition applies, but in reality, according to Einstein's relativity, the speed of light remains c in all inertial frames. So that might complicate things.

But wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, so the observer is in the lab frame. The light is moving within the glass, which is itself moving. So perhaps I should think about the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but the question is about
