Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could be added to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, right? And Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. Oh wait, because in relativity, the Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. So if something respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, in SMEFT, do all operators have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare?

Wait, I think SMEFT is constructed in a way that all terms are Poincare invariant. Because Poincare includes translations, which means the theory is Lorentz invariant and the same in all reference frames. So operators must respect Poincare, which would mean they also respect Lorentz. So if 2 is correct (Poincare), then 1 (Lorentz) is automatically correct. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators respect Poincare, then they must also respect Lorentz, but is Lorentz a separate requirement?

Hmm, maybe I should clarify. If a theory respects
