Okay, I need to find the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to another carbon). The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring attached to a hydroxymethyl group and another cyclohexyl group attached to the aldehyde. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let's look again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1. And at position 1, there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me parse the name. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is like cyclohexane with a -CH2CHO group? Or wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a cyclohexane with an aldehyde group directly attached. So, the structure would be cyclohexane with a -CHO group on one carbon and a substituent on that same carbon.

Wait, maybe the target structure is cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl?) and the other is an aldehyde group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group which has an OH and is attached to the aldehyde. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the target is a molecule where the cyclohexane ring is attached to a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and an aldehyde. Wait, perhaps it's a 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl)) group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is the cyclohexane with an aldehyde at one position, and a substituent at the
