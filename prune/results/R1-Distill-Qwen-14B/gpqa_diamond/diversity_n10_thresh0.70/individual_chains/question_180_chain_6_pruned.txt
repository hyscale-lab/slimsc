Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, okay. So this is an electrostatics problem involving calculating electric potential energy. Since all the charges are the same, the potential energy will be due to the interactions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, so the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. So the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But also, the 12 charges are probably not moving relative to each other since they're constrained, but I'm not sure if their arrangement affects the potential energy. Oh, but wait, the problem states that each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but I don't know their arrangement relative to each other. Hmm, maybe that's a detail I can ignore because it's an isolated system, and the potential energy is only due to their positions relative to each other and the fixed charge.

Wait, no. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So any two charges contribute to the total. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair. 

Let me think. The fixed charge at P is one of the 13. So that's the 13th, right? The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But what about their distances from each other? 

Well, if I imagine the 12 charges arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, then each of them is at some distance from the others. But wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't
