Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and another reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible choices for A and B.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that reactions with ketones and nitriles might involve nucleophilic substitution or addition. Let me think about each step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) with NaCN and Reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, wait. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide (like NaCN), I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. But ketones typically form secondary alcohols when reduced, but this is more about substitution maybe?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would probably lead to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin is when a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes an alkoxide after the attack, then protonated, I guess. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So butan-2-one has structure (CH3)2C=O. Adding CN- would make (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product in the question is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The nitrile (CN) would be on carbon 2, along with a hydroxyl (OH) and methyl groups. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-m
