Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So that's the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems, right? So the state can be written as a vector in the z-basis. But the problem is about another operator with a different matrix representation. Oh, wait, the operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would be 2x2 because it's for spin-1/2. Let me think, the matrix would be zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, because for i≠j, so (1,2) and (2,1) are non-zero. So this is actually the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A is (hbar/2) * X.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So the operator A has eigenstates which are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are the eigenstates of the spin x operator. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the question is, when we make a measurement of operator A, what is the probability of getting each eigenvalue, and what is the average value of A.

So first, we need to express the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector.

Wait, but another approach is to diagonalize matrix A first. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenvalues are ±hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so multiplying by
