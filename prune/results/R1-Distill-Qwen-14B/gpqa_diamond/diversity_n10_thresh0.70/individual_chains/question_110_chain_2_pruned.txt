Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding the problem.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Oh wait, no, wait: the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. "With ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So a star that's brighter than 17 mag (like, magnitude less than 17) is observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.

So both spectrographs can detect stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤16, because ESPRESSO goes up to 17 and HIRES up to 16. So any star that is brighter than 16 (i.e., magnitude ≤16) can be seen by both. But wait, I'm getting this a bit wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, that sounds counterint
