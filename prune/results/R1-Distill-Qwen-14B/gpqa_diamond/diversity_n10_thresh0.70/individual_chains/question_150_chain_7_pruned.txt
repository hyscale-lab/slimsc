Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves an NMR analysis and determining the structure of a compound, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's see.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Wait, let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, 2*8 +2 =18, minus 9 H, 0 X, plus 1 N. So 18-9+1=10. Divided by 2 is 5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That means 5 rings or double bonds or triple bonds. Probably a combination. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 3 degrees), an aldehyde (which is a double bond, another degree), and maybe some other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. Wait, that's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's one H as triplet. Wait, but wait, what could cause an aldehyde proton to be a triplet? Usually, aldehyde protons are deshielded and are split based on neighboring protons. But maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's next to a CH that's coupled with something else.

Then there's a signal at 6.98 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. Another at 6.51 ppm, a doublet for 2H. These look like aromatic protons. Let me think, perhaps a para-substituted benzene? Because the doublets for 2H each might indicate two sets of equivalent protons in a para arrangement. So maybe the substituents are in para positions.

Then a 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an alcohol -OH proton, but wait, 2H? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, these could be vinyl protons, but
