Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Oh, wait, no, that's the limit. So a star with V magnitude 17 or less can be observed. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V ≤16. So a star needs to have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the star must be apparent V ≤16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, but the question is about stars that can be detected with both. So the apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the lower limit for both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So only stars with V ≤16 can be observed by both.

Now, the stars are given as Star1 to Star5. Each has different parameters. I'll need to calculate their apparent V magnitude and see which ones are ≤16.

Starting with Star1: Absolute V magnitude Mv = 15.5, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10, so log(10/10)=0. So m = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So m=15.5. That's less than 16, so Star1 can be seen by both? Wait, but wait, Star1's m is 15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both can detect it. But wait, wait. Let's check all parameters.

Wait, Star1's RA and DEC: RA 15 deg, DEC -75. I don't think it matters for our current consideration because the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitude. So we don't have to worry about whether the telescopes can actually point to that star. So
