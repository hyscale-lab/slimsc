Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. They've given NMR data, and it's reacting through a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR is given as:

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure out the structure based on this. I remember that NMR can give information about the functional groups and the structure of the molecule. 

Starting with the peaks. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

Then, the next peak at 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be aromatic protons, possibly from a benzene ring. The coupling might indicate ortho substitution or maybe para. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually as a doublet when there's another substituent. Or maybe it's part of a coupling with another ring.

The next peak is at 6.51 ppm, also a doublet of 2H. Again, aromatic protons. Maybe this is another benzene ring, perhaps attached in a way that the protons are split into a doublet. So perhaps two benzene rings are involved.

Then there's 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H. Broad singlet could suggest either an aromatic ring with substituents that make the protons not split, or maybe a vinyl proton that's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, it might be an aldehyde adjacent to something, but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's part of a conjugated diene or maybe a ketone adjacent to an aldehyde? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, considering the aldehyde, maybe it's an alpha proton. The aldehyde is at 9.72, so the adjacent protons (like in a butyraldehyde) might be around 2-3 ppm. But 6.27 is higher, which doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system with another group.

The last peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That's around where methylene groups (CH2) attached to something electron-withdrawing might show up. Like OCH2 or maybe adjacent to an aldehyde. So maybe an OCH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings connected via some chain. Since the formula is C
