Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's break this down.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. Relativity comes into play here.

So, the first part is finding the relative speed. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds. Right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because if you just subtract, you might get something faster than light, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says "relative speed", which is the speed of one as seen from the other. So, maybe I should calculate the relative speed of B with respect to A.

Wait, no. The problem says "relative speed" between the two, but I need to clarify which frame we're considering. Oh, wait, I think the question is about the relative speed of the two astronauts as observed from one of their frames. Wait, but which frame? Oh, I think in relativity, the relative speed is frame-dependent, but I'm not entirely sure how it's calculated.

Wait, let's think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Then astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. From A's frame, what is B's speed? Because A is moving at 0.6c, B is moving slower. So B's speed relative to A would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c^2)).

Let me compute that. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. So one of those options is for the relative speed.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. The system is the two astronauts. So I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8=1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c². So the total energy is about 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but did I calculate the relative speed correctly? Let me check the formula again. The relative velocity u' of B from A's frame is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - v_A v_B / c²). Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, since A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's frame, B is moving at (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1-0.3) = 0.1/0.7 ≈0.1428c. Which is about 0.14c.

So that's correct. So the relative speed is 0.14c, and total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one object with respect to another in special relativity is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(v_1 = 0.6c\), and astronaut B (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(v_2 = 0.5c\), both in the same direction. Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A:
For astronaut A (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B:
For astronaut B (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of A and B:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(5.96m c^2\).

These match the values in **Option C**.
