Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about which decay channels are kinematically allowed for a boson X with mass 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need that for the kinematics part. Oh wait, the Lagrangian probably tells me what particles X can interact with, right?

The Lagrangian is L = -λf f(y)(ψ_f(y))(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh wait, perhaps it's L = -λ f f(y) [ῡ + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me look again. Oh, actually, the equation is written as L(y) = -λ f f_bar(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the interaction term is something like λ f f_bar X ψ_f? No, wait, maybe the term is L = -λ f (y) ψ_f† (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe the ψ_f is a fermion field, and the interaction is between X and fermions f.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as -λ f̄(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which would imply that X interacts with fermions ψ_f. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the specific fermions depend on the masses and the allowed decays based on energy.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion pairs can have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay X → f f̄ to be allowed, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. For a fermion pair, say f and f̄, each has a mass m_f. The rest mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into f f̄, the threshold condition is that 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So let's list all possible fermions and their masses. Let me recall approximate masses:

- e⁻: about 0.511 MeV (so negligible compared to GeV)
- μ⁻: about 105.7 MeV
- τ⁻: about 1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- u: around 2-5 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV)
- d: similar to u, maybe ~3-6 MeV
- s: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- c: about 1.27 GeV
- b: around 4.7 GeV
- t: way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks.

Wait, but wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's compute 2m_f for each fermion.

- e: 2*0.511 MeV ≈ 1 MeV → 0.001 GeV. So definitely allowed.
- μ: 2*105.7 MeV ≈ 211.4 MeV → 0.211 GeV. So allowed.
- τ: 2*1.777 GeV ≈ 3.554 GeV. 3.554 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
- u: 2* say 2 MeV = 4 MeV → 0.004 GeV. Allowed.
- d: same as u, around 0.006 GeV. Allowed.
- s: 2*0.095 GeV = 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- c: 2*1.27 GeV = 2.54 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.
- b: 2*4.7 GeV =9.4 GeV. 9.4 >6 GeV → Not allowed. So X cannot decay into b b̄.
- t: way too heavy, as mentioned.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A: includes b and s and u and d and tau and e. But we just determined that b is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, c is allowed. So the pairs are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So this would be possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so decay into t t̄ is not allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b isn't allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct option should be B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait but let me double-check. The mass of each fermion:

- c: ~1.27 GeV each. So 2*1.27=2.54 GeV <6 → allowed.
- s: ~95 MeV. 190 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
- u and d: negligible, so allowed.
- tau: 1.777 GeV each. 3.554 <6 → allowed.
- mu and e: even smaller, allowed.

So the allowed decays are all except b and t. So option B is the one that includes all except b and t.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e → yes, all allowed.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), but the specific decays depend on whether the combined mass of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). 

For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the threshold condition is \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). The approximate masses of the fermions are:

- \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_e \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \))
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_\mu \sim 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \))
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_\tau \sim 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( u \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_u \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \))
- \( d \): \( \sim 3-6 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_d \sim 6 \, \text{MeV} \))
- \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( 2m_s \sim 190 \, \text{MeV} \))
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_c \sim 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( 2m_b \sim 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy to decay into \( t \bar{t} \)).

From this, the allowed decays are:

- \( X \to e^+ e^- \) (allowed, \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \) (allowed, \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.211 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) (allowed, \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \) (allowed, \( 2m_u \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \) (allowed, \( 2m_d \sim 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \) (allowed, \( 2m_s \sim 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \) (allowed, \( 2m_c \sim 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because \( 2m_b \sim 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Hence, incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
