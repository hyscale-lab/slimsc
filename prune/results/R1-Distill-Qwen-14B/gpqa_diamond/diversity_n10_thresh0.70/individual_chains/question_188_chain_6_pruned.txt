Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all the angles between them are the same. Oh wait, right, that's why it's sometimes called a trigonal crystal system or a cubic system with all angles equal but maybe not 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are given as 30 degrees each, so not the usual cubic angles.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. There's a formula for calculating that, isn't there? I recall it's related to the reciprocal of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d^2 equals (h² + k² + l²) times something divided by the lattice constants and also considering the angles. Oh right, the general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos(βγ)/(a b) - 2hl cos(αγ)/(a c) - 2kl cos(αβ)/(b c)

Wait, but in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, right? Because all edges are equal. So that simplifies things. Also
