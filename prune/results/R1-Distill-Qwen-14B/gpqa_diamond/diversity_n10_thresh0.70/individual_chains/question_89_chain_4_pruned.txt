Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C to give a product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to give product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that when dibrominated compounds react with KOH, especially under such conditions, elimination reactions are common. Maybe an E2 mechanism? Since it's dibromo, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs, forming a double bond.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH would likely form an alkene. Because adamantane is a diamondoid structure, it's quite rigid. So 1,3-dibromo would probably eliminate to form 1,2-diamantadene or something similar. Wait, no, elimination of two bromides would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridge being formed, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diene or a single double bond.

Wait, product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, maybe for an -O- group, like an ether or something else. But wait, KOH is a strong base. Oh, wait, when you eliminate HBr, you form a double bond, but maybe in this case, the KOH could cause a substitution or elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds
