Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me see. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

Wait, the planets are Earth-like, so their sizes are similar. Oh, but the host stars' masses and radii matter here. The question says Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but they have the same radii. Interesting. So same size, but different masses.

The planets have the same mass. Oh, right, but we're talking about transit probability, which depends on the relative size of the planet and the star. Wait, no, more accurately, it depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but also the orbital distance. Because the transit probability is higher when the orbit is more likely to align edge-on, which is when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

The formula I recall for the probability of a transit is P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of orbits that are edge-on. Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is (R*/a) * ( (R_p + R*) / R* ), but wait, no, that's the depth. Hmm, no, wait, the transit probability is given by
