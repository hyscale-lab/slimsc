Alright, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, like a type of boson, right? They're composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that have a very short lifetime, so they decay quickly. 

The problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from these values. 

Wait, wait, mean decay distance. I remember that the mean proper lifetime (tau) of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the total decay width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship. Oh wait, Γ is the total decay rate, so the lifetime would be τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think Γ has units of energy. So when you take ħ (which is in units of GeV·s, since ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s), and divide by Γ (in GeV), the units would be seconds. But then I also need to consider the particle's velocity, because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime.

Oh right, the mean decay distance L is given by L = γ * β * c * τ. Where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, and c is the speed of light. 

So first, I need to compute the proper lifetime τ, then find the velocity of the meson, calculate gamma, and then multiply all together with c to get the distance.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute the proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity β of the meson using its energy and mass.
3. Calculate γ using the velocity.
4. Compute L = γ * β * c * τ.

Wait, but I should think about the energy given. The production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy. So the total energy E is 8 GeV. 

From special relativity, the energy E is related to mass m
