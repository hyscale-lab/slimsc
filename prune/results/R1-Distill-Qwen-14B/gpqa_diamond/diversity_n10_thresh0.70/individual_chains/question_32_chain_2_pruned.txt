Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. I need to figure out what that means first.

Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium atom has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. The speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So relativistic effects are definitely in play.

The energy in question is probably the total energy of the nucleus. The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, I'll calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me compute that.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me check that. 0.28 * 3.5714 is about 1, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the mass m of the nucleus. The nucleus is ^6Li, which has a mass. I think the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect, but wait, do I need the exact mass? Or can I use the atomic mass in some way?

Wait, in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, the mass is often considered in terms of the rest mass. The rest mass of a ^6Li nucleus. So I should find the rest mass energy of ^6Li.

The rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the actual mass of ^6Li would be the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons minus the binding energy. Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable to use the mass of ^6Li as approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, since each nucleon contributes about that.

Wait no, the mass of ^6Li is about 6 * 938 MeV/c², but that's not exactly correct because the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to
