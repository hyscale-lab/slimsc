Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots compared to the whole star. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots must be at 5000K, right?

The situation is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to vary. From our perspective, this looks like the star's brightness is periodically changing. The interesting part is that this could resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the question is, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the brightness variation, what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Wait, but the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So in that case, what would be the exoplanet's radius needed to give the same signal.

Hmm. So I think the approach is to calculate the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) caused by the spots, and then find what planetary radius would cause the same change.

First, let's understand what the spots do. When the spots are on the side facing us, they make the star appear dimmer because the spots are cooler. As the star rotates, the spots move into and out of view, causing dips in brightness.

The filling factor is 20% or 0.2. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the star's surface area. But wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots". Oh wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Because, imagine the star as a sphere—so the spots are covering 20% of the whole surface. Wait, but the problem says "one hemisphere is spotty", so maybe the spots are on one side, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere? Or is the filling factor 20% of the entire star? I think the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface area that is covered. So if one hemisphere is covered 20%, then the total spot area is 0.2 * (π R^2) ?

Wait no, the filling factor is defined as the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is all spots, the filling factor would be 50%, but in this case, each hemisphere has 20% coverage? No, wait the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 times (2π R² / 2) )? Wait, no. Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So if one hemisphere has 2
