Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark, so their temperature must be lower. The difference in temperature between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, perhaps?

The setup is that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of a star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is asking, if we didn't have these spots, what size of exoplanet would cause the same amplitude in the brightness variations as the spots do.

Wait, no. The scenario says that the situation (with the spots) can resemble an exoplanet. But the question is, to produce the same amplitude signal as this scenario, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius?

Hmm. So, the observed brightness variation comes from two effects: the spots being cooler and the planet blocking light when it transits.

Wait, no, wait. The problem is about photometric variations. When a planet transits, it blocks some starlight, causing a dip. The amplitude of that dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the spots on the star cause a variation in brightness when they rotate into and out of view. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer. So the overall brightness of the star changes as spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the variations. So without the spots, a planet would cause a dip when it transits. But in this case, the spots cause a dimming as the star rotates, so the brightness variation is due to the spots changing the observed flux. So the problem is equating the two scenarios: what planet size would cause the same change in brightness as the spot-induced variation.

So to find the radius of the planet (Rpl) relative to the star (Rstar), such that the brightness dip caused by the planet is the same as the amplitude from the spots.

Let me think about how to model both cases.

First, for the planet transit: the change in brightness (delta F) is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So delta_F_planet = (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2), because the area blocked is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 times the star's area. But since the star's area is the same, the relative change is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, no. Actually, when a planet transits, it blocks a fraction (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the star's light, so the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the relative change is that value.

Now, for the spots: the star's brightness varies
