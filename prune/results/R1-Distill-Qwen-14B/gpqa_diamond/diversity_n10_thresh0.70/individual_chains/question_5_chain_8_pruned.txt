Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, but the way the problem is framed, I think the operator is a vector operator, so P is a vector, and we're looking at its component along n. Or maybe it's about each component of P?

Wait, the way it's written: the operator is P with components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right! So the operator P is a vector operator, and when you have a direction n, the component of P along n is P·n, which would be a combination of Px, Py, Pz.

Wait, but the question says, "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n." So I think that operator is P_n = P·n, which would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, right? Because the operator's eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 systems. So the possible eigenstates would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for each component. But here, it's along an arbitrary direction n, so the eigenstate is the spin-up state along n.

But wait, the question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So the operator is P·n, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps each component Px, Py, Pz corresponds to the spin component in their respective directions. So, for example, P_x is the spin operator in the x-direction, and similarly for y and z.

So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along a given direction. So, if the direction is n, the eigenvectors are |+n> and |-n>, corresponding to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ
