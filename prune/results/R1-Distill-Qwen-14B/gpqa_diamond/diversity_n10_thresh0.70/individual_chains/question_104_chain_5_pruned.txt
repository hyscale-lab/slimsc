Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, the RV signal (the semi-amplitude K) depends on several factors. The formula I think is K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * something? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Because when the star is moving due to the planet's orbit, the velocity depends on the mass ratio and the orbital period. Wait, maybe it's better to write the exact formula.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember the simplified version when M_p << M_star, which is the usual case for exoplanets. Then the formula simplifies.

In that case, K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / (2π)^(1/3) ) * something. Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach. Since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have same mass (Neptune-like), but different K (5 and 7 mA), the periods will be different.

But wait, the problem states that the planets have similar masses to Neptune, but their K values are different. So, perhaps the formula relates K with the period.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I think is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈
