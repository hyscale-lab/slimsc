Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets are similar to Neptune in mass. The orbital shifts in their spectral lines are given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. Wait, but the question is about the orbital period ratio—how much longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's orbit. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and the characteristics of the orbit.

The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is proportional to (M sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) * (1/(1-e²)^(0.5))... but since e is zero here (circ orbits), that part is 1. Also, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass. So M_planet/M_star is negligible. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact formula. Alternatively, I've heard that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p approximates to M_*, so (1 + M_p/M_*) is about 1, so we can ignore that term.

So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But when M_p << M_*, this becomes:

K ≈ [ (G P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on, as RV method usually finds), and e is zero, so we can ignore that.

So K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_*. Also, both planets have similar masses, M_p is same for both. So M_p and M_* are same for both planets. So K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), because all other factors are same.

So K1 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) * C, where C is a constant for both planets since M_p and M_* are same.

Similarly, K2 = (1 / P2^(1/3)) * C.

But wait, the question states that the spectral line shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #1 and #2 respectively. Wait, wait, but the actual velocity semi-amplitude K is what causes the Doppler shift. So perhaps the shift in wavelength is proportional to K. Because the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, so v is proportional to Δλ.

So K is proportional to the measured Δλ.

Wait, the more precise relation is: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is equal to (Δλ / λ) * c, because the Doppler shift formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c. So K is proportional to (Δλ / λ) * c. But since λ is the same for the same spectral line, and c is a constant, then K is proportional to Δλ.

So, for the two planets, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7 milliangstroms. So K2/K1 = 7/5.

But earlier, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But according to the measured shifts, K2 is larger than K1. So K2 = (7/5) * K1.

So,

K2 = (7/5) * K1

But K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) = 7/5.

Wait, let me set up the equation correctly.

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So since K2/K1 = 7/5,

(1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = 7/5

Which is (P1 / P2 )^(1/3) = 7/5

So cube both sides:

P1 / P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744

So P1 = 2.744 * P2 → P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3646 * P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1.

So P2 = 0.3646 * P1 → P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2 / P1 is 0.3646. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's period.

Wait, but the options are about how many times longer P2 is than P1. If P2 is shorter, the ratio (P2 / P1) is less than 1. So the answer would be something like 0.36 times as long.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the equation correctly?

Wait, let me double-check. So K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. Because K and 1/P^(1/3) are directly proportional. So a larger K implies a smaller P.

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2)^3.

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me write P as proportional to (1/K)^3.

So P1 ∝ (1/K1)^3, P2 ∝ (1/K2)^3.

Then P2 / P1 = ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1 / K2 )^3.

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3.

Because K2 > K1, (K1/K2) is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2's period is about 0.36 times P1's, which is about 0.36 times as long. So the answer is A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( 1/P^{1/3} \), which means:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the spectral line shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively, we can infer that \( K_2 / K_1 = 7/5 \). Using the proportionality \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), we relate \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) to \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \):

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

Substituting \( K_2 / K_1 = 7/5 \):

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{125}{343}
\]

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{5^3}{7^3}
\]

Thus, the ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
