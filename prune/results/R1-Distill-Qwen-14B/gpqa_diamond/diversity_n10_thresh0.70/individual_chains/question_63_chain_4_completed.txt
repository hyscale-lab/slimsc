Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. Oh right, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it's something like X-Y, where X and Y have masses given as Mx and My. The bond length is R, and angular frequency is w. The options are for the photon's momentum.

First, I think I should figure out what transitions are allowed. When a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of the photon must match the difference between two energy states. Since the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's the lowest energy state. I'm assuming the fundamental state is the ground state, so the next state would be the first excited state.

But wait, what's the structure of the energy levels here? For diatomic molecules, the rotation and vibration are coupled. The energy levels are quantized and given by some formula involving both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers.

Wait, the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either increasing v or J. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the order of energy levels? Vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational because vibrational involves kinetic and potential energy, which is higher than rotational which is just kinetic.

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state (J=1), not the next vibrational state (v=1). Because the rotational states are lower in energy than the vibrational ones. Or wait, no, that depends. Let me think: the vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħw. So the first vibrational state (v=1) would have higher energy than the ground state. The rotational energy levels are Er = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia.

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible lower energy state would be either increasing J or v. Wait, no. The next state that's higher in energy than the ground state. So the smallest possible energy increase would be the smallest possible transition. So between the ground state and the next state, which requires the least energy? Let me compute the energies.

Wait, the energy of the ground state is Ev=0, J=0: E = (0 + 1/2) ħw + (0) * (0+1) * B, but wait, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational. Or is it the product? No, no, it's additive. So the ground state is Ev=0 and J=0: E = (0 + 1/2) ħw + 0 = (1/2 ħw) + 0 = 1/2 ħw.

Wait, or is the rotational energy separate? Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total energy being the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the ground state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state would likely be the next rotational state (J=1), because the rotational energy levels are closer together than the vibrational ones. Because the vibrational energy spacing is ħw, and rotational spacing is B (which is typically much smaller than ħw).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be EJ=1 - EJ=0 = B*(1)*(1+1) - 0 = 2B. Because B = ħ²/(2I), right?

Wait, the rotational energy levels are Er = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

Alternatively, the next state might involve both a change in rotation and vibration. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that implies the smallest possible energy jump, so probably the lowest ΔE, which would be the rotational transition.

Wait, but perhaps the photon can cause a transition where both rotation and vibration change. But since it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, perhaps the photon will cause a vibrational transition, because rotational transitions require lower energy? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: compute the energy of the ground state, then find the next state that's the next higher energy. The next state after the ground state would be either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1). Which of these has a lower energy difference?

Let's calculate both.

First, compute B (rotational constant): B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², μ is the reduced mass.

So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but we need to convert amu into kg to get I in kg·m².

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.011e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.011e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is the reduced Planck constant: ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46) ) → let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 → about 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.204e-46 = 2.408e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.408) * 1e-22 → approx 0.4618 * 1e-22 = 4.618e-23 J.

Wait, that's B in Joules? Or is it in terms of energy? Hmm, perhaps I should keep it as B for now.

Wait, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B, which is approximately 2 *4.618e-23 = 9.236e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy spacing is ħw. Because the energy levels for vibration are Ev = (v + 1/2) ħw. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħw.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħw = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two energy differences: the vibrational transition gives 4.218e-20 J, and the rotational gives ~9e-23 J. Wait, wait, 9.236e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition would require a smaller energy photon.

So because the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to v=0, J=1. That requires energy ΔE = 2B = 9.236e-23 J.

Wait, but wait: the problem asks for the photon's momentum. So the energy of the photon should be equal to the energy difference, right? Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, its energy increases by the photon's energy.

But wait, another thought: in quantum mechanics, transitions can also involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But if the photon's energy is the minimal possible to move to the next state, which is the next rotational state, then the photon's energy is 2B.

Wait, but the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B = 9.236e-23 J.

But wait, the options are given in momentum p. So how do I find p from E?

Wait, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. Because for photons, E = pc, since their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

So p = (9.236e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.078e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. The options are around 1e-27 or 1e-28.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculation?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Compute B again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstrom = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.204e-46 = 2.408e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.408e-46) ≈ (1.112/2.408) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4618 *1e-22 → 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.236e-23 J.

But wait, the energy of the photon is 9.236e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.236e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.078e-31 kg m/s.

But the options given are much larger: 1e-27, etc. So perhaps I've messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule can't transition only rotationally because the question is about the rotation-vibration model. Maybe the transition involves both rotation and vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is for a vibrational transition, and I was wrong earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), but that would require a larger energy jump. Let me calculate that.

Energy difference for v=0 to v=1 is ħw. As I calculated earlier, that's about 4.218e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. Hmm, that's close. But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so that would be the lower energy photon. But perhaps in the model, transitions are only allowed when both rotation and vibration change. Or perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as v=0, J=0, and the next state is v=1, J=0, which would be higher in energy.

Wait, another point: the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational states. So the energy levels are a product of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the energy is Ev + Er. So the ground state is v=0, J=0: E = (1/2) ħw + 0.

The next possible state is either v=0, J=1 (which is lower energy than v=1, J=0) because 2B is much less than ħw.

So the molecule would first transition to v=0, J=1, requiring 2B energy.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B = 9.236e-23 J.

Which gives p = E/c = 3.078e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the formula for B. Let me recall: the rotational energy levels are given by Er = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I). Wait, no, wait, the correct formula is Er = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So yes, B is ħ²/(2I). So that part was correct.

Wait, maybe I confused I with the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate I.

I = μ R².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu → 20 *2 =40, 20+2=22 → μ=40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg → 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters.

I = (3.01e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.01e-27 *4e-20 → 1.204e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46) → numerator is 1.112e-68, denominator 2.408e-46 → 4.618e-23 J for B.

So 2B is 9.236e-23 J. Then p_photon = E/c = 9.236e-23 /3e8 → 3.078e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. The options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy selection. Maybe the molecule needs to transition to the next state with the next possible energy, which is a combination of both vibrational and rotational. But that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0. As I calculated earlier, the energy difference for J=1 is about 9e-23 J, and for v=1 is 4e-20 J. So the lowest energy transition is J=1, which requires a photon with E=9e-23 J.

But the problem is that the options don't match that. So perhaps I'm considering the wrong model. Maybe the question is referring to the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħw and Er = B J (J+1). So the total energy is the sum.

Wait, but the question says the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the same as the rotation-vibration model. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition isn't purely rotational. Maybe it's a combination, but the photon's energy must match the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, but the rotational state is also changed. For example, v=1, J=0. Then the energy difference would be Ev(1) - Ev(0) = ħw.

So the photon's energy would be ħw, which is 4.218e-20 J. Then p = E/c = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D: 1.4e-28.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. That matches the calculation if the photon's energy is ħw.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the photon's momentum higher than that?

Ah, wait, perhaps the model requires that the molecule must change both vibrational and rotational states. Or perhaps the question is only considering vibrational transitions, but that doesn't make sense because the photon's energy would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy, and the next state is the next possible state, which could be a vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state must be the one with the smallest energy increment above the ground state.

Which would be the rotational transition, since 9.2e-23 J < 4.2e-20 J.

Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the calculations for B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1 or something else. Wait, no, the calculation was in J.

Another possibility: perhaps the model allows for simultaneous changes in J and v, but the energy difference is a combination. But then, the minimal jump might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which is v=1, but with the rotational state also changing. But that would give a larger energy difference.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ² / (2I)

I = μ R^2.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) /22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Ah, wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) amu → 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Divide by 2I: 2 * 1.204e-46 = 2.408e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.236e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy E_photon = 2B = 9.236e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.236e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.078e-31 kg m/s.

But the options given are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are near 3e-31. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum using the relativistic equation, but for photons, it's E = pc, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are not just additive, but it's a product or something else. Or perhaps the energy difference is for a vibrational transition with a change in rotational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator and a rigid rotor, which have quantized energy levels as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħw and Er = B J (J+1). The total energy is Ev + Er.

So the ground state is v=0, J=0: E = (1/2) ħw + 0 = (1/2) ħw.

The next state with the next lowest energy would be v=0, J=1: E = (1/2 ħw) + 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B.

Wait, but earlier calculation says 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

But let's compute the photon's momentum again: p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for bond vibrations, but perhaps the bond length isn't fixed. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the model uses a different formula for energy levels. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is Er = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So B is (ħ²/(2I)). But perhaps in the non-rigid model, the bond length isn't fixed, but I don't think that changes the formula here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of μ. Let me recheck μ.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) → 20 *2 =40, 20+2=22 → 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, but the calculation for that gives a momentum of ~1.4e-28, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the rotational transition would require a lower energy photon, but perhaps the model expects a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, regardless of the rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased such that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state', which refers to the first vibrational state, but that doesn't make sense because the fundamental state is usually the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first rotational state, but the calculation for that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem's 'fundamental state' refers to the first excited state. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me check the calculation of B again.

B = ħ²/(2I) → ω for rotation is sqrt(ħ²/( I k)), but no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy level can be expressed in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the vibrational frequency to compute the rotational constant. But I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, perhaps the given angular frequency w is for the vibration, and the rotational constant B is related to w in some way. But I don't think so.

Wait, another angle: The total energy levels for rotation-vibration are given by:

E(J, v) = ħw(v + 1/2) + B J (J + 1)

So the ground state is J=0, v=0: E = (1/2) ħw.

The next state is J=1, v=0: E = (1/2) ħw + 2B.

The photon's energy is E = 2B.

But as before, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B using the given w.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is related to the vibrational frequency w. Let me think about this.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I). I is μ R².

But perhaps the question expects us to compute B using the given vibrational frequency w. But I don't see a direct relation between B and w, unless perhaps through the force constant.

Wait, the vibrational frequency w is related to the force constant k and the reduced mass μ by w = sqrt(k/μ). So perhaps I can find k and then relate it to I.

But I don't think that's necessary here. Because the problem gives us w, which is for vibration, and R for bond length, and masses Mx and My.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using the given w and other constants.

Wait, but I don't see a direct formula to connect B and w, except through μ and I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1, which requires 2B.

But as we saw, the momentum comes out to be ~3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s. Let's see what energy that corresponds to.

p = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → E = p c = 1.4e-28 * 3e8 = 4.2e-20 J.

Which is exactly the energy of the vibrational transition (ħw =4.2e-20 J).

So perhaps the question is implying that the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, not the rotational state.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon's energy be 4.2e-20 J?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but the next state involves a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But that would require a much higher energy photon.

But why would the question not consider the possibility of a lower-energy rotational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used doesn't allow for pure rotational transitions, and only allows transitions that change both v and J. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the next state is the first vibrational state, regardless of the rotational state. So the photon's energy is ħw, which is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would the question not consider the lower-energy rotational transition? Because perhaps the rotational transitions are forbidden or not allowed in this model. Or perhaps the problem is structured in a way that the next state is the first vibrational state.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about it again.

The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state in energy would be either J=1, v=0 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Between these two, the rotational state requires less energy, so the photon would have to supply that lower energy.

But according to the calculations, that leads to a momentum that's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change. Or perhaps the model being used doesn't allow for pure rotational transitions, and the minimal transition is a vibrational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy of the photon being the difference between the first excited rotational state and the ground state.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Maybe I should present the answer as D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next possible state in the rotation-vibration model, which could be a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy difference between the (v=0, J=0) and (v=1, J=0) states, which is ħw.

So E_photon = ħw =4.218e-20 J → p = E/c ≈ 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would the next state be vibrational then? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Ah, perhaps the model doesn't allow for pure rotational transitions. Or perhaps the rotational transitions are forbidden in this context.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the first transition is the vibrational one because the rotational transitions are part of the same energy level in some models.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to test the knowledge of the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational part.

Given that the options include D as 1.4e-28, which matches the vibrational transition, I think that's the intended answer.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is modeled as a combination of rotational and vibrational states, with energy levels given by:

\[
E(J, v) = \hbar \omega \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) + B J (J + 1),
\]

where \(v\) is the vibrational quantum number, \(J\) is the rotational quantum number, \(\hbar \omega\) is the vibrational energy spacing, and \(B\) is the rotational constant.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (\(\mu\)):**
   The reduced mass is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y},
   \]
   where \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}\) and \(M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\). Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/amu} = 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (\(I\)):**
   Using the bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant (\(B\)):**
   The rotational constant is:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I},
   \]
   where \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}\). Substituting:
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.204 \times 10^{-46}} = 4.618 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition:**
   The energy difference between \(J = 0\) and \(J = 1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.618 \times 10^{-23} = 9.236 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition:**
   The vibrational energy spacing is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Photon Momentum:**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\(p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)):** This does not match the calculated momentum for either the rotational or vibrational transition.
- **Option B (\(p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)):** This is far too large and inconsistent with the energy differences.
- **Option C (\(p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)):** This is also far too large and does not match the calculated momentum.
- **Option D (\(p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)):** This matches the momentum calculated for the vibrational transition (\(p = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}\)).

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the next state involves a vibrational transition rather than a rotational one, as the calculated momentum for the vibrational transition matches one of the options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
