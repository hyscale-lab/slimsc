Okay, so I have this crystallography problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is 1/(sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... some terms involving the angles ... )). But wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but not necessarily the angles. Or wait, rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, but the angles can be different. Wait, no, maybe in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal and the angles are equal? Or is that a different type of crystal? I might need to think about that.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma could be different. But in this case, the given is that all three angles are 30 degrees. So, perhaps it's a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. Or maybe it's a triclinic system? No, wait, no—rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems, and in that, all a, b, c are equal, but the angles can be different. So in this case, the angles are all 30, so it's a rhombohedral system.

Wait, but the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. I think interatomic distance refers to the length of the unit cell edge. Oh wait, no. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter a. But in more complex structures, the atoms are not necessarily at the corners of the unit cell, so the interatomic distance might not be the same as a. Hmm, but wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps this refers to the lattice parameter a being 10 Angstrom? Or is it the interatomic distance between nearest neighbors?

Wait, maybe in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a is equal to the interatomic distance. But in a BCC or FCC structure, the interatomic distance would be a√3/4 for FCC (since the atoms are at the corners and the face centers, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals). But since the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance here is given as the lattice parameter 'a', which is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, this might need some clarification. So the problem says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral structure, the lattice vectors are a, b, c with a = b = c, but the angles between them are
