Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? I remember the pp chain is the main source of energy for the Sun, producing helium and generating neutrinos. Wait, there are different branches in the pp chain. The pp-I and pp-II branches involve boron, while the pp-III branch is something else. Oh wait, no, I think the pp-I and pp-II involve the capture of protons by boron-5 or something like that. The pp-III branch might be the main one where two protons fuse into deuterium and then another proton adds on, releasing a positron and a neutrino.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops. So that means whatever neutrinos are produced in that branch won't be happening anymore. But the question says this happened 8.5 minutes ago, which is the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to Earth. So the neutrinos from the Sun's core take about 8 minutes to reach us, so if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we're just now seeing the effect on the flux here on Earth.

The question is about the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we need to find flux_band1 / flux_band2.

I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp-III branch, which produces neutrinos with energies around 250 keV, but wait, no, I'm not sure. Or maybe I'm confusing it with another process. Wait, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle might have higher energies. Or wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain typically have lower energies. Let me think. The main neutrinos come from the beta decay in the pp chain. So the neutrinos are produced when a proton captures a positron and emits a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around a few tens of keV, but wait, other processes, like the CNO cycle, might produce higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is the
