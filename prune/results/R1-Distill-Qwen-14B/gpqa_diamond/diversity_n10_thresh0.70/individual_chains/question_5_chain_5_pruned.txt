Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we're supposed to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each of which is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators (like Lx, Ly, Lz) have specific matrix representations. Since P is an operator with components, it's probably related to angular momentum. But the question mentions a muon, which is a lepton like an electron, so maybe it's spin-1/2. So P could be the spin angular momentum operator for the muon.

The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 for each component. But since the direction is arbitrary, along an axis in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should be aligned along that direction.

Wait, the operator here is P, but I think the operator in the spin case would be the spin angular momentum S. But regardless, the approach should be similar.

The components of the operator P are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

So the operator vector P is in the x-z plane, direction n. So the operator we're looking at is P·n, right? Because the operator for angular momentum along an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of the vector operator with n.

Wait, the question says that the eigenvector is for the operator P along direction n. So I think the operator we're considering is P·n_hat, where n_hat is the unit vector in the direction of n.

Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, because in the x-z plane, the angle with the z-axis is θ, and the direction can be parametrized as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the unit vector n_hat is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So our operator P·n_hat is:

P·n_hat = Px * (n_x) + Py * (n_y) + Pz * (n_z)

But since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So it's Px * sinθ + Pz * cosθ.

So the operator becomes:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

Multiplying out:

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ * 1 , sinθ * 1 ],
           [ sinθ * 1 , - cosθ * 1 ] ]

So the matrix looks like:
[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   (-ħ/2 cosθ) ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute element-wise.

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * cosθ because the Pz matrix has 1 in (1,
