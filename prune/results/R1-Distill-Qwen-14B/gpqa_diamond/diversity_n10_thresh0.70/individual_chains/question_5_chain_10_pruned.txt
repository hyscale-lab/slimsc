Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the operator P, which is a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, I should probably start by recalling what I know about spin operators and eigenvectors. The operator in question is P, which seems analogous to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh right, because for electrons (and muons too), the spin operators are often represented using the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the components of P are given as P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator we're interested in is the total P vector dotted with the direction vector n. So, the operator would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the operator becomes P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Hmm, but wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me denote θ as the angle that n makes with the z-axis. Then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) ), where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is [ (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z) ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me think about how to find the eigenvector for this operator. Since each P component is (ħ/2)σ_i, the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). So the equation is:

( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ> 

Because when we factor out (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation becomes (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, no, because the operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = (n_x (ħ/2 σ_x) + n_z (ħ/2 σ_z )) ), and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2). So the equation is:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

Because (n_x (σ_x) + n_z (σ_z)) multiplied by |ψ> gives (
