Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6 operators are common in SMEFT.

Wait, what's Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it would also respect Poincare because Poincare is a broader symmetry. Or is it the other way around? No, Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait, but do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think so. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So operators must be Lorentz scalars. That would mean Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must. And since Poincare includes translations and Lorentz, operators must respect Poincare (2) as well. So 1 and 2 are necessary.

What about CP symmetry? CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. SMEFT operators can violate CP, right? For example, in the Standard Model, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So in SMEFT, you can have CP-violating operators as well. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily a must.

Then CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formalism and the structure of the theory require that. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4).

So putting it together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators? They must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2) because they're Lorentz-invariant. And CPT (4), because any Lorentz-invariant theory must have CPT symmetry.

Wait, but does Poincare imply Lore
