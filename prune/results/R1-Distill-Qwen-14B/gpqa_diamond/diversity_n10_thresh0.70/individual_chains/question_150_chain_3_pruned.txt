Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. It's then reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product among the options given.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me break that down: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, a nitrogen, and an oxygen. Hmm, that's a total degree of unsaturation. Let me calculate that.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so:

(2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees: maybe a ring and some double bonds or something. Since the molecule also has a nitro group (since the formula has N and O, and I think the reagents involve nitrous acid, which is used in diazotization reactions).

Wait, but wait, the reagents are NaNO2 and HCl. Oh, right, that's usually for diazotization. So the starting material probably has an aromatic amine group (like an aniline derivative) because that's what reacts with nitrous acid under cold conditions. Diazonium salt formation.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) — that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So that's one possibility. Or maybe an aromatic proton in a para-substituted ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like an -OH? But that's usually broader. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Hmm.

6.98 (d, 2H) — doublet, two hydrogens. Maybe aromatic protons in a disubstituted ring. Like para-substituted, so each has one neighboring proton, making them doublets.

6.51 (d, 2H) — another doublet. Maybe another set of aromatic protons. If these are adjacent to each other, perhaps in a substituent?

6.27 (bs, 2H) — broad singlet, two hydrogens. Could be an -OH group? Or maybe an aromatic ring with two protons that are deshielded but not coupled, like in a di-substituted position but not split much.

3.66 (d, 2H) — doublet, two hydrogens. This is probably a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2 something. So maybe an OCH2- group attached to something else. The doublet suggests that each proton is next to another equivalent one, like in a CH2 connected to something else, such as an oxygen.

Putting this together: maybe a structure with an aromatic ring, an aldehyde group, and an
