Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. The task is to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, with the options provided.

Hmm, right. So, I think this is an electrostatics problem involving potential energy between charges. Since the system is isolated, I don't have to worry about external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

So, each particle has a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, meaning 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

The setup is that 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and one is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P.

Wait, but how are those 12 arranged? Are they equally spaced on the surface? I think for the minimum potential energy, the charges should be arranged in a way that minimizes repulsion. But wait, since all the charges are positive (since each is 2e), they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, they should be as far apart as possible. Oh, but in this case, they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at that radius.

So the arrangement is fixed. So the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, each at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So it's the central charge. All other charges are on a sphere around it.

So the system's potential energy comes from two types of interactions:

1. The potential energy between the central charge (at P) and each of the 12 surrounding charges.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

Since potential energy is a state function, and since the system is isolated, I can calculate
