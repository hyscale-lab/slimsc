Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit detection. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the question says both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That gives them the minimum masses and orbital periods. But the RV method doesn't tell us the exact orbital inclination, right? So for transit detection, we care about the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits.

The probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, another thought: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the sine of the inclination. No, wait, the probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance of the planet's orbit. Specifically, the probability P is approximately P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - eÂ²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies to R_star / a_planet.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up some factors. Another formula I remember: the probability is
