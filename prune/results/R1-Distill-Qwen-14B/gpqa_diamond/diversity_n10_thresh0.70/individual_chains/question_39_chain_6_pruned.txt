Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, okay, the wave function is a complex number because of the 'i' term. But when I measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the particles are only in that interval. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Oh wait, right, when the wave function is normalized, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space should equal 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. Wait, no, the wave function isn't zero, but the probability is zero. Hmm, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, so the integral from -infinity to infinity of |ψ(x)|² dx will be 1, and the wave function is zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the given wave function is only valid in that interval, and zero otherwise. 

Wait, the question says the wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -
