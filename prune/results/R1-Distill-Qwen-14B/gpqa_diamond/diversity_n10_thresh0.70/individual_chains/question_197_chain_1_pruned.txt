Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid cleavage of alkenes, especially in the context of the Prins reaction or for the cleavage of double bonds. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus might be involved in the dehydration of alcohols or maybe some kind of acid catalysis. Wait, wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is a reagent used for the cleavage of alkenes, particularly in the Hofmann degradation or maybe the Prins reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's more about the oxy-HI reaction. Hmm, perhaps I should think about what reaction conditions are created here.

The problem provides IR and NMR data for Compound X. The options are all various substituted benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 (so
