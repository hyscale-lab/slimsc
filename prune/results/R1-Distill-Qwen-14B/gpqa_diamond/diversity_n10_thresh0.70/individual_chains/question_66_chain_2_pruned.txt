Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model gauge symmetry. Effective theories usually don't break the underlying symmetries of the original theory, except for the ones that are explicitly broken.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it might not necessarily respect Poincare, but wait, I think all the operators in SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant. Because the SM itself is Lorentz invariant, so the effective theory should also respect it.

Wait no, Poincare includes translations as well. So if a term is not translation invariant, like having a derivative, that's part of Poincare. But SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect translations. So operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 would be required.

But wait, do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare? Because the SM does, so the effective theory should too. So options that include both 1 and 2 are possible. Looking at the options, option A is 1,2. Option C is 1,2,4. So 4 is CPT symmetry.

Wait, what about CPT symmetry? The SM is CPT symmetric. Effective theories built from SM should also respect CPT, unless the operator explicitly breaks it. But SMEFT operators are built from SM fields, which are CPT symmetric. So yes, SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

CP symmetry: The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact. For example, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So operators wouldn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. Therefore, 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if any operator in SMEFT violates a symmetry, then that symmetry isn't a must-respect
