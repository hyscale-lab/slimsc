Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in organic reactions, the reagents are crucial for determining what kind of reaction happens. 

The problem has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what usually happens? Oh wait, I remember the nucleophilic addition to ketones. So NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, which are nucleophiles. They attack the carbonyl group.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- attacks, it would add to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. But wait, how does that work? The cyanide ion as a nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen then gets a negative charge, which would pick up a proton to become hydroxyl. So the product would have an OH and a CN group on the same carbon, right?

So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The conditions for that usually involve an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile, it might not attack under basic conditions. So acid catalysis would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. That makes sense. So reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ maybe?

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+ or something else. Option C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, right! Sodium bisulfite is used in the sulfite addition to carbonyl compounds. But in that case, the product is a bisulfite adduct, which upon workup gives the diol. But in this case, the product has a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So I don't think bisulfite is involved here.

So I think the first step uses acid catalysis. So A is H3O+ which is option A or B. Now, what about the second reaction?

The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with H2O and reagent B to get a carboxylic acid. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, meaning the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a -COOH group. How does that happen?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid involve either acidic or basic
