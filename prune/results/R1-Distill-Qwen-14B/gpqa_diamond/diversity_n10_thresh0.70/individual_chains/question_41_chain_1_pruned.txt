Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is all relative motion. The glass is moving, so I think I have to consider how the observer in the lab frame measures the speed of the light beam.

Wait, isn't this a relativistic situation? Or maybe not, because v is probably non-relativistic. But the question doesn't specify, so I guess I can't assume that. Hmm, but for the sake of the problem, maybe they're expecting a non-relativistic approach.

Let me think. The glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. But wait, from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So I need to find out how the speed of light in the glass appears in the lab frame.

Wait, no. The light beam is propagating through the glass. So in the glass's frame, the speed of light is v_light = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be different.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light in the glass (but I'm not sure if it's a simple addition because velocities don't add that way in relativity).

Wait, but maybe this is a Doppler effect problem? Or maybe not. Another approach: using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving with velocity v, and the light's velocity in the glass frame is u', then the lab frame would see u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c^2)) ), but wait, c is the
