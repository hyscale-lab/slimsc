Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. They say that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The form is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, so S looks like this:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are related to spin operators. The Pauli sigma matrices, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh right, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are (ℏ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But wait, our matrix S here has entries with i and -i. Let me think—what's the structure of the Pauli matrices? 

The Pauli σ_y matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which matches exactly with S here. So S is σ_y. So that means S is actually the Pauli matrix σ_y. So then, A_y is c multiplied by σ_y, right?

But wait, c is given as h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin operator is usually represented as S = (ℏ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Hmm, because for electrons, the spin is 1/2, so S is (ℏ/2) times each Pauli matrix. 

But here, the operator is given as c·S, but I'm not sure if that's the same. Alternatively, perhaps this setup is using a different scaling. Let me think about the eigenvalues of S.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? So for σ_y, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. But here, A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y, so the eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by those eigenvalues. So the possible eigenvalues would be (h/(4π))(1) and (h/(4π
