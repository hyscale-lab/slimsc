Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has 3 protons normally. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, I think. Because the atomic number is 3, and mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6.

So I need to find the total energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c. Oh, right, in particle physics, when they talk about energy in colliders, they're usually referring to the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... wait, what's the molar mass of Li-6? Lithium has an atomic mass of about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, the isotope mass for Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units (u). Because Li-7 is the most common, but Li-6 is lighter. Let me recall, the exact value is about 6.017 u. So the rest mass energy is m*c², which in units of GeV would be m (in u) multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u, because
