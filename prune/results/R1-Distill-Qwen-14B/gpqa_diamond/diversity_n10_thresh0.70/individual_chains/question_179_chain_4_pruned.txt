Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Hmm, let's take it step by step. 

The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators, and unitary matrices are important because they preserve probabilities, right? Also, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities.

The matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says there exists a vector such that when you multiply it by e^X, the norm changes. Wait, the norm would change if e^X isn't unitary. Because unitary operators preserve the norm. So, for a vector v, ||e^X v|| = ||v|| only if e^X is unitary. But for e^X to be unitary, X must be a skew-Hermitian matrix. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So, is X skew-Hermitian?

Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X. Let me compute X's conjugate transpose. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate of X (X†) would be:

Row 1: (-i)*, (-1)*, (2i)* → Row 1 becomes -i, -1, -2i.
Wait, no, wait. Conjugate transpose swaps rows and columns and takes complex conjugate. Let me write X again:

X = [
[i, -1, 2i],
[1, 0, 1],
[2i, -1, -i]
]

So, X† would be the transpose of X's conjugate. Let me compute each element.

Element (1,1) of X is i. Conjugate is -i. In X†, it's at (1,1), so X†[1][1] = -i.

Element (1,2): X has -1 at (1,2). Conjugate is -1. Transposed to (2,1). So X†[2][1] = -1.

Element (1,3): 2i → conjugate is -2i. Transposed to (3,1). X†[3][1] = -2i.

Second row: X[2][1] is 1 → conjugate 1. Transposed to (1,2). X†[1][2] = 1.

X[2][2] is 0 → 0. X†[2][2] = 0.

X[2][3] is 1 → conjugate 1. X†[3][2] = 1.

Third row: X[3][1] is 2i → -2i. X†[1][3] = -2i.

X[3][2
