Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but let's think through it.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. The 'C3' part refers to a three-fold rotation axis, and the 'h' means there's a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options provided, I see four molecules. I'll go through each one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The structure might be a tricyclic compound with three rings maybe? I'm not exactly sure, but the substituents are symmetrical. If each phenyl is in a symmetric position, perhaps it has a three-fold symmetry. But I'm not certain about the mirror plane.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So benzo implies a benzene ring fused with a tricyclic system? Maybe a benzofuran or similar? I'm not exactly remembering the structure. But if it's a fused ring system with three substituents, perhaps it has a three-fold symmetry. I'm not sure about the mirror plane here either.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a boron atom attached to oxygen. Triisopropyl means three isopropyl groups. Triisopropyl borate is [(i-Pr)3BO-]. Wait, no, the structure is typically [B(O-iPr)3], so the boron is in the center with three identical isopropyl groups attached. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis because all three substituents are the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. So if you look down the boron, the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically. That suggests a C3 axis. Now, for a horizontal mirror plane. The mirror plane would need to pass through the boron and bisect each isopropyl group. Each isopropyl group has its own symmetry, right? So yes, the molecule should have a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry applies here?

Wait, but wait. The structure of triisopropyl borate. The borate ion is [B(O-iPr)3]^-. Boron is in the center with three O-iPr groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, so yes, a C3 axis. Each O-iPr is symmetric, so there should be mirror planes. Each mirror plane would be through the boron and each O-iPr, but wait, the 'h' in C3h is a horizontal mirror plane, not a vertical one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the horizontal mirror plane
