Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember harmonic oscillators from my mechanics classes, but this one is relativistic, so things might be a bit different. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, in a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by something like v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So without relativity, that would be option C, maybe. But this is relativistic, so we can't ignore relativistic effects.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So we probably need to use relativistic equations of motion or energy. The key here is that the energy can't exceed the relativistic total energy.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, how does the energy work for a harmonic oscillator in relativity? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it would be the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1)mc².

Alternatively, perhaps the system is being treated in a way that the total energy is conserved, considering relativistic effects. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all its energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

So let's model this. The total energy E should be equal at all points. So at x=A, E = (1/2)kA² (potential) plus the kinetic energy. But wait, at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². 

Wait, but that's non-relativistic. In the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but when x is
