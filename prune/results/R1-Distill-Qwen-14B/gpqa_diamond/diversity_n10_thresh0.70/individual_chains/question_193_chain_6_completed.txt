Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's number of stars N = something times 1/(parallax)^5. Wait, the exact relationship is given as N ∝ 1/parallax^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Hmm, and the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So, we're looking for how N depends on r, or maybe the rate of change of N with r? Or perhaps the differential number of stars per distance increment?

Wait, I think I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no. The formula is usually plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / d (where d is in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, let me substitute d into that. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. Let's see. So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So N ∝ (1/plx) ^5 → N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx^5) is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, but I think it's more about the number per unit volume or per some other measure. Or perhaps the differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux or density. Or maybe it's about the number density. Let me recall some concepts.

The number of stars in a certain volume is related to their distribution. If more stars are at a certain distance, that affects how the number changes with distance.

Wait, parallax relates to distance. So, if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx =1/d), then N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because stars farther away should be less visible, but maybe in this region, there are more stars at larger distances, which would make the number of stars increase with d^5. But that's the given relation.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So is it the absolute number of stars at a given distance r, or the number per unit distance?

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, which is the differential number. Let's think about that.

If N is the total number of stars at a distance less than or equal to r, then dN/dr would be the number of stars per unit distance. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, if N is the number of stars at a specific distance r, then the change in N with r could be considered.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5.

But wait, if you're looking at how the number of stars varies with distance, that would just be N ∝ d^5. So per unit of distance, the number increases with the fifth power.

Wait, but the options given are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So in that case, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the differential number, meaning the number of stars per unit distance. So for a small change in r, how does the number of stars in that shell (at radius r) change.

If N is the total number of stars up to distance r, then dN/dr would be the number of stars per unit distance. But according to the given, N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, that would be if N is the cumulative number. Alternatively, if N is the number per unit distance, perhaps the given relation is different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me restate the problem.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d.

So N ∝ d^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^5.

Wait, but if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell (per unit distance) would be d^5. Or wait, is it the total number up to that distance? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a volume element depends on the distance. Volume scales with r^2 in solid angle (since volume is 4π r^2 dr), but this might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number density. If more stars are present at larger distances, how does the number per unit volume change?

Wait, but the question seems to be about the number of stars in the region as a function of distance. So perhaps in a given solid angle (like a region of the sky), the number of stars at a distance r is given by N(r) ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5.

So N(r) is proportional to r^5. So with increasing r, the number increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region would change with distance as r^5.

But wait, that's if N is proportional to d^5. So the correct dependence is r^5, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number per unit distance. Let me think about the differential.

If N(r) = k * r^5, then the change in N with r is dN/dr = 5k r^4. But the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Hmm. So per unit distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^4. But that would be the derivative.

Wait, but the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 / plx^5". So it's given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ d^5 (since plx =1/d). So when they ask how the number changes with distance, it's proportional to d^5.

So the answer would be B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose you have a certain volume of space. The number of stars in that volume depends on r. If you consider a thin shell at distance r, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the surface area (4π r²) and the number per unit area. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r (with r in parsecs), then N ∝ r^5. So for a given region, as r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

So the answer should be B) ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), where \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the number of stars per unit distance, which is proportional to \( r^5 \). Therefore, the correct dependence is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
