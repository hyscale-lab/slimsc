Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says it's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

Wait, the problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â†” CaEDTA^2-, right?

The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-] divided by ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio. Or wait, the solution is the complex itself, so when you dissolve it, it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as C. So C = 0.02 M. When it dissociates, it will produce some calcium ions and some EDTA ions. Let's let the concentration of Ca^2+ be x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca and one EDTA, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x.

Wait, no, wait. Or is that correct
