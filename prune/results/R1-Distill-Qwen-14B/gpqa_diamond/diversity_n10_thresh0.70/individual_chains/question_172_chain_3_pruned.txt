Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about the photosphere and excitation levels, it's related to the thermal conditions of the star. Oh wait, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means that the gas in the photosphere behaves according to the laws of thermodynamics in small regions. So, the stars are in thermal equilibrium.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the excitation level is about how many atoms are in a higher energy state. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, we can assume that the statistical weights (g) for the two levels are the same for both stars because we're comparing the same energy levels. Or wait, does the question say anything about the statistical weights? No, it just says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So I guess we can consider that the g values are the same and can be canceled out. So the ratio of excitation depends only on the exponential term.

So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me write down the ratios. Let’s denote the populations as n1 and n2 for the two stars. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, wait. Wait, no, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice that of n2_upper / n2_lower. Because the question says "twice as excited", meaning the population in the excited state is higher. So:

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

But using the Boltzmann factor, each ratio is exp( -ΔE / (k T) ). So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, because let me think again. The ratio for star_1 is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2 it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). The problem says star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio. So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, that seems right. Because n1/n1_lower = 2*(n2/n2_lower). Alternatively, perhaps I should write the ratio for each star and then set up the equation.

So, for star 1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Star 2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k
