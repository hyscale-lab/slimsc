Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. Parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

Wait, but the problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Because plx is in the denominator, maybe I can express it in terms of distance. Let's substitute plx with 1/d, since plx = 1/d.

So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. Therefore, 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, I'm supposed to find how N changes with r, which is distance. So in terms of distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^5?

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r. Because when you go outwards in distance, you're looking at a larger volume, so more stars. But the exact dependence would come from the density and the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number density. Let me think. If the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that's not possible because as you go further away, the density of stars should decrease, but the volume increases. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars
