Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The question gives me a matrix S, and the operator Ay is c multiplied by S, with c being h/(4π). Let me try to break this down.

So, Ay is given by c times S. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, so S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay is c * S. So substituting c = h/(4π), Ay looks like:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, I think angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to their spin. Since we're dealing with a muon, which is a lepton with spin 1/2, right? So the spin matrices S should correspond to the Pauli matrices or something similar.

Wait, wait. The spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz for spin-1/2 particles are all proportional to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2. But in this problem, S is given as a specific matrix. Let me compute what S is.

Wait, S is [0 -i; i 0
