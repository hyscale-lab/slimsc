Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And they're both in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). I need to find the correct equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio of excited to ground state, or something like that.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, n2 is the number in the higher energy level, n1 in the lower. g factors are the statistical weights. But the problem says that the excitation is twice as much, so I think n2/n1 would be 2 for star_1 relative to star_2? Or wait, actually, the problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe star_1 has twice the number of excited atoms compared to star_2? Or perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning more in the higher level.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for that particular energy level, the number is higher in star_1.

So, let's denote the number of atoms in the excited state as n1 for star_1 and n2 for star_2. Then, according to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2. But wait, that might not be the case because the energy levels and their respective populations depend on temperature.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The ratio of (n_upper / n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, their ratio depends on their own temperature.

So, for star_1: (n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_upper)_2 / (n_lower)_2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) )

But the problem says that (n_upper)_1 is twice (n_upper)_2, but wait no, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. Hmm, maybe the ratio n_upper / n_lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, in star_1, the excitation is higher, so that ratio would be higher. Let me think. Let’s denote that for each star, the ratio is R1 and R2 respectively. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Because in star_1, the excitation is twice as much, so R1 = 2
