Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, so the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. That probably means that the direction can be described by an angle theta from the z-axis, right? Because in the x-z plane, the polar angle theta would determine the direction, and phi would be 0 since it's in the x-z plane, not needing the azimuthal angle.

The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator in question is probably the spin operator in the direction n, which is a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. Oh right, because spin operators in an arbitrary direction are given by the dot product of the vector with the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the spin operator along direction n is S·n, right? Which would be (n_x Sx + n_y Sy + n_z Sz). But wait, in this problem, I'm dealing with operator P, but I think P is analogous to the spin operator.

So first, I need to figure out the explicit form of the operator P along direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, a point in the x-z plane would have phi=0, so x is proportional to sinθ, y is 0, and z is cosθ. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P along n would be P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Wait, wait, no. Because the operator is P·n, so each component of P (Px, Py, Pz) is multiplied by the corresponding component of n and summed. So P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since in this case, n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Now, Px is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let me write that down.

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is:

P = (n_x) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out the (ħ/2) term:

P = (ħ/2) * [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix inside becomes:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

Because:

First element (1,1) is n_z * 1 + n_x * 0 → n_z.
(1,2) is n_x *1 → n_x.
(2,1) is n_x *1 → n_x.
(2,2) is (-n_z) from Pz, so -n_z.

So P matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to simplify:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

Let me write the matrix equation:

[ n_z   n_x ] [a]   = [a]
[ n_x  -n_z ] [b]     [b]

So, for each component:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z) b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Hmm, these are two equations. Let me write them again.

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → Equation (1)

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → Equation (2)

I can write this in matrix form for the homogeneous system:

[ (n_z -1)  n_x ] [a]   = 0
[ n_x       (-n_z -1) ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero. Let's compute the determinant.

Determinant D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

= [ (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) ) ] - n_x²
Wait, let me compute it correctly. 

Alternatively:

D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2
= [ (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) ) ] - n_x²
= [ -n_z^2 + n_z -n_z +1 ] - n_x²
Wait, let's compute it step by step.

Multiply (n_z -1)(-n_z -1):

= n_z*(-n_z) + n_z*(-1) -1*(-n_z) -1*(-1)
= -n_z² -n_z +n_z +1
Simplify: -n_z² +0 +1 → -(n_z)^2 +1.

So D= (-n_z^2 +1) - (n_x)^2.

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Because n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, so (sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 =1.

So n_x² = 1 - n_z².

So substitute into D:

D= (1 - n_z²) - (n_z² -1 +1 -n_z²? Wait, wait— wait, no.

Wait, D= [1 - n_z²] - n_x² → but n_x² =1 - n_z². So:

D= [1 - n_z²] - (1 - n_z²) ) → 0. So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we have an eigenvalue problem, and we're looking for non-trivial solutions.

So the two equations are not independent. Let me take equation 1:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but let's plug in the expressions for n_x and n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps I should express this ratio differently. Let's factor:

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), right? Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2). So cosθ -1= - (1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So let me substitute these into the expression for a in terms of b.

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The numerator is -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Denominator is -2 sin²(theta/2)

So the negatives cancel, and the 2s cancel. So we get [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2).

So let me write a = cot(theta/2) * b.

But for the eigenvector, we can choose b as a parameter, say, set b=1. Then a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but let's consider that in terms of components. Let me consider the vector as [a, b]. So the eigenvector can be written as:

[ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But wait, let me check equation 2 to see if it gives the same result.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Plugging in a= cot(theta/2) * b:

sinθ * cot(theta/2) + [ -cosθ -1 ] b =0.

Compute sinθ * cot(theta/2). Let's express in terms of theta/2.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So sinθ * cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos^2(theta/2).

So equation 2 becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2) + [ (-cosθ -1) ] b =0.

But wait, let's substitute cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So -cosθ -1 = -(2 cos²(theta/2) -1) -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 = -2 cos²(theta/2).

So equation 2 becomes:

2 cos^2(theta/2) -2 cos^2(theta/2) * b =
