Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a star with a certain radius and mass, but maybe those aren't super relevant to the question. The important parts are about the effective temperature and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

So, when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the spots are cooler, right? So the overall effective temperature might be a weighted average based on the area covered.

Wait, no, the problem states that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I think that's a simplification because when spots are present, the star's light is less than when it's all unspotted. But in this case, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus not.

The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio decreases, so when there are spots, the ratio is lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it does. So, the factor is (ratio
