Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me start by understanding the information given.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V magnitude <=16.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the text says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Brighter means lower magnitude number. So a star with V=17 is the limit for ESPRESSO. So apparent V <=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V <=16 can be observed.

So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V magnitude <=16 because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So the star must have apparent V <=16, because that's the stricter condition.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. I think I need to calculate its apparent magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) = 15.5 +5*0=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it because 15.5 < 16 and <17.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag. So ESPRESSO can see it (<=17), but HIRES can't, as it needs <=16. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, but wait, there's extinction E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, right, extinction affects apparent magnitude. The formula for extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = around 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude without extinction is given as 15.5. But extinction makes it appear dimmer, so I need to add A_V to get the actual apparent magnitude.

So Star3's m_observed = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. Hmm. Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude without considering extinction is m0. But because of extinction, the star appears dimmer, so the actual m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, yes. Because if there's extinction, the star is fainter. So the apparent magnitude increases. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So for HIRES, which requires apparent V <=16, 17.36 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. What about ESPRESSO? It requires <=17. So 17.36 is above 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it either. Wait, no, no. Wait, the problem statement says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V brighter than 17 can be observed. So m <=17 can be observed. So 17.36 is beyond, so ESPRESSO can't see it either. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but wait the star's apparent V is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is 0.6. So the actual observed V is 15.5 + 3.1 * 0.6 = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So both telescopes can't see it because 17.36 is above their limits.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recheck the note: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but after extinction, it's 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So it's beyond both telescopes' limits. So Star3 cannot be seen by either.

Star4: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 * 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. But there's E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_observed = 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, which needs m <=16, 16.74 is too bright (wait, no, wait. Brighter magnitude is lower. So 16.74 is higher than 16, so it's fainter. So HIRES can't see it because 16.74 >16. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.74 is within its limit. So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not
