Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance? So, I need to find the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let me rewrite that in terms of r. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So substituting plx with 1/r, we get 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Wait, N ∝ 1/(plx^5) → N ∝ r^5 because plx is 1/r. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So when you move a small amount in distance, how does the number of stars change? Because the options are about the dependence on r, but I think it's the number per unit distance, like a differential.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more precisely. Let me think in terms of differential calculus. So N is proportional to r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, wait. The problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and since plx is 1/r, N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that can't be the whole story. Because if N increases with r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly as you go further. But that seems counterint
