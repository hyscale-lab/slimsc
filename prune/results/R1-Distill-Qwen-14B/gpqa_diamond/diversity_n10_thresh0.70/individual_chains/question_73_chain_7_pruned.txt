Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's parse the problem. There are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds.

The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options give different combinations, so I need to calculate both.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just the difference in their speeds because of the way velocities add relativistically. Oh right, you can't just subtract their speeds normally. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²). But wait, which one is u and which is v here? Because relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other.

Let me think. Let's designate the first astronaut (2m) as moving at velocity u = 0.6c, and the second (3m) at v = 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says "relative speed", which I think refers to the speed of one as
