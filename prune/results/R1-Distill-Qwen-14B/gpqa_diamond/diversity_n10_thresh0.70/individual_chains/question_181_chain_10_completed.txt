Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain part of the Sun's fusion suddenly stops. Hmm, let's think about it step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core processes—pp chain and CNO cycle. Oh right, the pp chain has branches. The pp-I, II, and III. I think pp-III is one of the main branches that produces a lot of neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is a significant contributor to the solar neutrino flux, right? So stopping it would affect the neutrino production.

So, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of high-energy neutrinos. Like, the main neutrino lines are from the Beryllium-7 (Be7) and Boron-8 (B8) in the sun. Oh wait, the B8 decay produces high-energy neutrinos. And the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which contributes to the majority of the Sun's energy, but maybe more neutrinos in certain energy ranges.

Wait, what's the typical neutrino energy distribution? The Sun emits neutrinos across a spectrum, but certain energies are more prominent. The Beryllium neutrinos peak around 478 keV and 511 keV (I think). Then the Boron-8 neutrinos have a higher energy, maybe around 15-20 MeV, but wait, that's way higher than the bands we're looking at here (700-900 keV). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the sources. Or perhaps the question is about the energy bands of the neutrinos emitted from different reactions.

Wait, the pp-III branch. Let me think about the pp chain in the Sun. The proton-proton chain has several branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which involves the fusion of two protons into deuterium, then another deuterium to helium-4. But the pp-II and pp-III branches involve more steps and produce different isotopes. Oh, I think the pp-III branch produces Beryllium-8, which then decays into two alpha particles, but wait, no—Be8 is unstable and tends to capture another proton to form Boron-8. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is the dominant one producing B8, which then decays into two He-4 nuclei and emits neutrinos.

Wait, but the neutrinos from B8 are the ones that are high-energy. The B8 decay produces a neutrino with energy around 15 MeV, but wait, that's way higher than the 700-800 and 800-900 keV ranges. So if the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, that would stop the production of B8 neutrinos. So the high-energy neutrinos (above a few MeV) would drop. 

But the question is about the flux ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, would that affect these bands?

Wait, no. Because the neutrinos from B8 are higher energy. So the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands might be dominated by other sources. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the neutrino energy spectrum from the pp-III branch. If the pp-III stopped, maybe the number of neutrinos in certain energy ranges would change.

Wait, another thought. The main solar neutrinos come from the decay of B8. The B8 neutrinos have a continuous spectrum peaking around 15 MeV. So neutrinos in the MeV range are from B8. But the bands in the question are in the hundreds of keV, which is lower than MeV. So maybe those come from other sources, like the Be7 neutrinos. Wait, Be7 captures a proton to become B8, and in that decay, it emits a neutrino. The Be7 neutrinos have lower energies. The main line is at around 478 keV, I think. So, the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands are higher than that. So, perhaps in the Sun, the neutrino flux at these energies comes from the B8 decay.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stopped, which produces B8, then the B8 neutrinos would stop. So, the neutrino flux in higher energy bands (above maybe 500 keV) would drop. But in the scenario, the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, so the neutrinos emitted now (from the present) are from the reactions that have been ongoing. So, if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would stop arriving 8.5 minutes later, meaning right now, we wouldn't get any neutrinos from that process anymore.

Wait, but the problem says, the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. So, the solar neutrinos we're detecting now are from the reactions that happened in the Sun before that time. So, the neutrinos we're getting now are from the time when the pp-III was operational. But if the pp-III stopped, what about the remaining reactions? Do other branches contribute to neutrinos?

Wait, the pp chain has other branches, like the pp-I and pp-II. Let me think. The pp-I is the main branch, producing He-4 via two steps. But the pp-II and pp-III are other branches that also contribute, especially in lower metallicity conditions or different regions of the Sun's core.

So, if pp-III stops, the main pp-I and pp-II continue? Or maybe the question is that all other reactions remain the same. Wait, the question says, "all other reactions remained as they were." So the pp-III stopped, but pp-I and pp-II continue. Or perhaps the other reactions are the same as before. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read: "hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were."

So, the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) are still going, so neutrinos from those would continue. So, what neutrinos are produced by the pp-I and pp-II branches? Well, pp-I leads to He-4 and produces some neutrinos. I think the main neutrino sources are from the B8 decay, which comes from the pp-III branch. So if pp-III stopped, the B8 neutrinos would stop, but the other sources (like Be7 from other branches) would continue?

Wait, but if pp-III stopped, would B8 production stop? Because B8 is produced via the pp-III branch. So the B8 neutrinos are from B8 decay, which is from the pp-III. So without pp-III, B8 production stops, so no B8 neutrinos. But what about the other neutrino sources?

Alternatively, thinking about the neutrinos from the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle burns protons into C-12 and then via steps produces He-4. The CNO cycle contributes to neutrinos as well, but I'm not sure about the exact energy spectrum. Wait, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are also high-energy, similar to the B8 neutrinos. Or is that right? I think the CNO neutrinos are also of higher energy but perhaps not as dominant as the B8 ones.

Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, perhaps the CNO cycle continues. Because the CNO cycle is a separate process. The question says that only the pp-III branch stopped, others remain. So CNO reactions are still ongoing, producing their neutrinos.

So, the solar neutrino flux is a mix of B8 neutrinos (from pp-III) and CNO neutrinos (from the CNO cycle), and possibly Be7 neutrinos from other branches.

Wait, the Be7 neutrinos have lower energies. So, if the pp-III stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (from B8) would stop, but the lower-energy ones (Be7 and CNO) would continue. But the question is about the flux in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands. Hmm, where do these come from? 

Let me think about the energy ranges. 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, these are in the MeV range. B8 neutrinos have a spectrum peaking around 15 MeV, but they have a tail extending down to lower energies. Similarly, CNO neutrinos are also high energy, perhaps in similar ranges.

If the B8 neutrinos (from pp-III) stopped, but the CNO neutrinos are still being emitted, what would happen to the flux in these energy bands?

Wait, before the pp-III stopped, the total neutrino flux in these bands was a combination of B8 and CNO. So, if B8 stopped, the flux would drop to just CNO. But the problem says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so now the neutrinos we detect are the ones emitted before that time, which includes B8. Wait, but neutrinos travel at light speed, so neutrinos emitted 8.5 minutes ago arrive now. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then neutrinos emitted after that time (from any source) would not reach us yet. So, neutrinos emitted before the pp-III stopped would still be arriving. 

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The Sun is emitting neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted since that time (from any other sources) would not have reached Earth yet. So, the neutrinos that are currently arriving are those emitted before the pp-III stopped. So, the neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands would be from both B8 (pp-III) and CNO. But now, after the pp-III stopped, the only neutrinos being emitted in the Sun are from pp-I, pp-II, and CNO. So, the current neutrino flux at Earth is a mix of the pre-pp-III-stopping and the ongoing processes.

Wait, no. Because the neutrinos we detect are from the Sun's inner regions, emitted over the past 8.5 minutes. Because it takes about 8 minutes for neutrinos to reach Earth. So, the neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes are what we're detecting now. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means that the neutrinos emitted during the last 8.5 minutes (from any source) are from the pp-III stopping. Hmm, no, that can't be right. Let me clarify.

When the pp-III stopped, all neutrino production from that branch stopped. So, any neutrinos emitted after that stopping (from pp-III) would stop. But other branches (pp-I, pp-II, and CNO) continue. So, the neutrinos emitted during the past 8.5 minutes (from other branches) are still coming. Wait, but the pp-III branch was responsible for producing a lot of neutrinos. So, if it stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then from that point on, the neutrinos in the flux would come only from the other sources.

But the question is, what is the ratio of the current flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV). Before the pp-III stopped, the flux in these bands was higher because the B8 neutrinos contributed. Now, without B8, the flux in these bands would come from other sources, mainly CNO neutrinos.

Wait, but what's the typical flux ratio between these two bands when considering only the CNO neutrinos?

Alternatively, maybe the Be7 neutrinos are in the lower keV range, so their contribution to 700-800 and 800-900 keV would be minimal. So, the main neutrinos in these bands are from B8 and CNO.

If pp-III stopped, the B8 neutrinos would drop. So, the flux in these bands would be just CNO. So, the question is, what's the ratio of CNO flux in 700-800 to 800-900 keV?

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact energy spectrum of CNO neutrinos. Let me think. The CNO neutrinos are produced in the CNO cycle, which involves higher temperatures and densities. The neutrinos from the CNO cycle have a higher average energy than the B8 neutrinos, perhaps? Or maybe a similar range.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, meaning they have a higher average energy. If the CNO neutrinos are more abundant at higher energies, then the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be higher than band 1 (700-800 keV), assuming the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks beyond 800 keV.

Wait, the B8 neutrinos have a spectrum that extends into the higher energies, but their flux drops off quickly. The CNO neutrinos might have a somewhat similar distribution but perhaps with a different shape.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos contribute more neutrinos at higher energies. So, if B8 neutrinos were the main contributors, and they're gone, the remaining CNO neutrinos would have a higher flux at higher energies.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. If the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band2 than band1, then the ratio would be less than 1. If before pp-III stopped, the B8 neutrinos made band1 and band2 have similar fluxes, then after stopping, the CNO neutrinos may have a different ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the B8 neutrinos have a peak around 15 MeV, but their flux drops off rapidly below that. So, the lower-energy neutrinos (like in 700-800 keV) are a small fraction of the total B8 neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos, on the other hand, might have a different distribution.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in the 800-900 keV band compared to the 700-800 keV band. So, if the B8 neutrinos are gone, the CNO would shift the ratio.

But without knowing the exact spectrum, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos dominated the high-energy bands, so without them, the relative contributions from CNO would change the ratio.

Let me think about the initial scenario. Before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band1 and band2 was a combination of B8 and CNO. B8's flux drops with energy, so the B8 contribution to band2 is less than band1 (since B8's flux is higher at higher energies but drops off quickly). Wait, actually, B8's flux peaks at higher energies and then declines. So, the 700-800 keV band is below the peak, so more B8 neutrinos are at higher energies. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the B8 neutrinos have a spectrum that is relatively flat in the lower MeV range. So, the flux in the 700-800 keV band is similar to that in 800-900 keV, but perhaps higher than lower keV bands. If B8 neutrinos are no longer present, then the CNO neutrinos, which might have a harder spectrum, could have a higher flux in the higher band.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, perhaps the question is assuming that the pp-III neutrinos (B8) contribute to both bands, and the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band2.

Alternatively, maybe the B8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, so without them, both fluxes drop, but the question is about the ratio.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of flux between band1 and band2. If the B8 neutrinos were the main source, and their flux drops quickly with energy, then band1 (700-800) would have more B8 neutrinos than band2 (800-900), making band1's flux higher. But if B8 is gone, and the only source is CNO, which might have a different spectrum, perhaps band2's flux is higher than band1.

Alternatively, think about the typical solar neutrino flux. The dominant neutrinos are the B8 ones, which peak around 15 MeV. The flux at lower energies (like 700 keV) is a tail of the B8 distribution. The CNO neutrinos are a smaller component but have their own spectrum.

So, prior to the pp-III stopping, the 700-800 band would have some B8 and some CNO. The 800-900 band would have less B8 (since B8 flux drops) but perhaps more CNO. So, the ratio (band1/band2) would be (B8_700-800 + CNO_700-800) / (B8_800-900 + CNO_800-900).

If B8 is the main contributor, then B8_700-800 is larger than B8_800-900. But CNO_800-900 could be larger than CNO_700-800, depending on their spectrum.

Wait, but if the B8 neutrinos are gone, then the flux is only from CNO. So, the ratio becomes (CNO_700-800)/(CNO_800-900). What's the typical CNO neutrino energy spectrum like?

I think the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, meaning higher energies. So, their flux decreases less rapidly with energy than the B8 neutrinos. Or perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks at higher energies. If that's the case, then in the CNO spectrum, the flux in 800-900 keV is higher than in 700-800 keV. So, the ratio would be less than 1.

If the CNO_700-800 is X, and CNO_800-900 is Y, and Y > X, then the ratio X/Y would be less than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a similar or even higher flux in the higher band. So, after the pp-III stopped, the flux in 800-900 (band2) is higher than in 700-800 (band1). So, the ratio would be (flux band1) / (flux band2) which is (X)/(Y) < 1.

So, the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1. So, if X/Y is 0.1, that's option D.

But why would the ratio be 0.1? Let's think about the CNO neutrino spectrum. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum where each decade in energy has roughly similar flux, or perhaps it's a power law.

Alternatively, if the CNO neutrinos have a power-law spectrum F(E) ~ E^-gamma, where gamma is around 2 or so. Then, the flux in each band would be the integral over E of F(E) dE.

So, for F(E) = k E^-gamma, the integral from E1 to E2 is k ∫ E1^E2 E^(-gamma) dE = k [ (E2^{1-gamma} - E1^{1-gamma}) / (1 - gamma) ) ].

Assuming gamma is 2, then:

Flux in band1 (700-800 keV) = k [ (800^-1 - 700^-1) * (10^3 eV) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the ratio.

If gamma is 2, then the integral from E1 to E2 is proportional to (E2^{-1} - E1^{-1}) ).

So, the ratio (band1)/(band2) is [ (800^-1 -700^-1) ] / [ (900^-1 -800^-1) ].

Let's compute this:

Compute 1/700 - 1/800 = (800 -700)/(700*800) )= 100/(560000) ) = 1/5600 ≈ 0.0001786.

Compute 1/800 -1/900 = (900-800)/(800*900) )= 100/(720000)= 1/7200≈ 0.0001389.

So, the ratio is (1/5600) / (1/7200) )= 7200/5600 ≈ 1.2857.

So, F(band1)/F(band2) ≈ 1.2857. So, around 1.3.

But that's under a gamma of 2 assumption. If gamma is higher, say gamma=3, it would be:

Band1: 800^-2 -700^-2 = (700^2 -800^2)/(700^2 *800^2 ). Wait, 700^2=490000, 800^2=640000. So, 490000 -640000= -150000. So, (800^-2 -700^-2) = ( (1/64e4) - (1/49e4) ) = (49e4 -64e4)/(49e4 *64e4) )= (-15e4)/(3.136e10) )= approx -4.78e-7.

Wait, but since it's 800^-2 -700^-2, it's negative. But in the integral, it should be the absolute value. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the positive contribution. Wait, no, because E is going up, and F(E) decreases with E, so the integral from 700 to 800 is larger than from 800 to 900, but because the function is decreasing, the integral (flux) in a higher band would be less than the lower band.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of logarithms.

Alternatively, maybe the assumption about the spectrum is incorrect. Another approach: if the neutrino flux from the CNO cycle is lower in the 700-800 band than in 800-900, then the ratio would be less than 1.

But without knowing the exact distribution, maybe another approach is needed. Let's think about the relative contributions of pp-III and CNO before the pp-III stopped.

The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by B8 neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos are a smaller component. So, when the pp-III stopped, the B8 neutrinos are gone, leaving only the CNO neutrinos.

Assuming that the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) than in the lower (700-800), the flux in band2 is higher than band1. So, the ratio band1/band2 would be less than 1.

If the ratio is around 0.1, that's option D.

Alternatively, if the CNO neutrinos have a similar flux in both bands, the ratio would be close to 1, which is option C. But I think that depends on the spectrum.

Another thought: the B8 neutrinos have a higher flux in higher energy bands, but their flux drops quickly. The CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, perhaps with a more gradual drop-off. So, the CNO contribution to 800-900 keV is higher than to 700-800.

If that's the case, the ratio would be less than 1. So, options B or D.

If the ratio was 0.1, that would mean band2 is 10 times band1. But why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the B8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, and their removal leaves only CNO neutrinos. If the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band2 than band1, the ratio would be less than 1.

If the ratio is 0.1, that would mean that band1 is 10% of band2, which is a significant drop. That would happen if CNO neutrinos have much more flux in band2 than band1.

But without precise knowledge, it's hard. Maybe the answer is D) 0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III were the main source of neutrinos in both bands, so removing them would leave the CNO neutrinos. But if the CNO neutrinos have a similar energy distribution, the ratio remains ~1.

But I think that's not the case. Perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, so their flux in higher bands is greater.

Another angle: the pp-III branch accounts for ~90% of the solar neutrinos. So, if it stops, the remaining neutrinos are from CNO and pp-I/II.

But what's the typical energy distribution of the CNO neutrinos? I think they have a harder spectrum, so higher flux in higher energy bands.

So, after stopping pp-III, the CNO neutrinos would dominate the higher energies more than the lower.

So, the ratio (band1/band2) would be (CNO_band1)/(CNO_band2). If CNO has more in band2, then the ratio is <1.

But how much less?

If the CNO neutrino flux has a higher flux in band2 than band1, but not extremely so, perhaps the ratio is around 0.1.

Wait, but perhaps the pp-III neutrinos (B8) had a higher flux in band1 than CNO, and similar in band2. So, when B8 is gone, the CNO's band1 and band2 are what's left.

If the CNO neutrinos in band1 and band2 have a similar ratio, then the overall ratio would stay about the same as before. But without knowing the initial ratio, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the B8 neutrinos have a higher flux in band1 than in band2, while CNO have a higher flux in band2 than band1. So, the total ratio would change.

Let me think about the B8 and CNO contributions.

Before stopping, flux_band1 = B8_band1 + CNO_band1.

Flux_band2 = B8_band2 + CNO_band2.

After stopping, flux_band1 = CNO_band1.

Flux_band2 = CNO_band2.

The question is the ratio (flux_band1)/(flux_band2) after stopping.

If, in B8, B8_band1 > B8_band2. And in CNO, CNO_band2 > CNO_band1. Then, after stopping, the ratio may be about (CNO_band1)/(CNO_band2), which is less than 1.

But how much less?

Another angle: the B8 neutrinos contribute more to the lower band (band1) because their spectrum drops off with energy. So, B8_band1 > B8_band2. The CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, so CNO_band2 > CNO_band1.

So, when B8 stops, the new ratio is (CNO_band1)/(CNO_band2) = R.

Now, if the B8 contribution to band1 was higher than to band2, and CNO's contribution to band2 is higher than to band1, the overall R could vary.

But without exact numbers, it's tough. Maybe the best approach is to recall that when the pp-III branch stopped (as in the solar neutrino problem historically), the observed neutrino flux dropped significantly, around a factor of 3, because the B8 neutrinos were about 60% of the total flux. But in this question, it's about the ratio of two bands.

Wait, another thought. The B8 neutrinos have a higher energy and a spectrum that peaks around 15 MeV, but the tail extends down. So, the number of B8 neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band is less than those in the 800-900 keV band, because 800 keV is lower than 15 MeV, and the higher energy part is more populated. Wait, no, the B8 spectrum peaks at higher energies, so the lower energy bands (like 700-800) would have fewer neutrinos than higher ones. So B8_band2 < B8_band1.

Wait, no. The B8 neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks at around 15 MeV, but the number of neutrinos at lower energies (like 700 keV) is actually higher because the flux is a cumulative effect. Wait, no, no. The flux decreases with energy. So, the number of neutrinos at 700 keV is higher than at 800 keV for B8. Because as energy increases, the number of neutrinos decreases.

Wait, no, wait. The B8 neutrinos have a spectrum F(E) = k E^(-gamma), where gamma is around 2. So, higher E has lower F(E). So, the lower energy bands (band1) would have more neutrinos than higher bands (band2).

So, in B8, B8_band1 > B8_band2.

In CNO, perhaps the spectrum is similar but with a higher normalization. So, CNO_band1 and CNO_band2 are both lower than B8, but their ratio could be different.

If the CNO neutrinos have a similar spectrum to B8, then CNO_band1 > CNO_band2, and the ratio band1/band2 would be similar to B8's ratio.

If the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum (gamma is smaller), then CNO_band2 would be a larger fraction of CNO_band1. So, CNO_band2 > CNO_band1, leading to a lower ratio.

But what's the typical gamma for CNO neutrinos? I'm not sure, but I think B8 has gamma around 2, and CNO might have a similar or slightly harder spectrum.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a lower gamma, meaning their flux decreases less rapidly with energy. So, CNO_band2 > CNO_band1, leading to a lower ratio.

If that's the case, then (CNO_band1)/(CNO_band2) would be less than 1, perhaps around 0.1.

Putting it all together, the ratio would drop to 0.1, which is option D.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) in the Sun, assuming the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (B8) neutrinos, which are a significant contributor to the solar neutrino flux. The CNO cycle, which produces its own neutrinos, continues unaffected.

### Key Points:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - **B8 Neutrinos**: Produced by the pp-III branch, these neutrinos have a spectrum peaking around 15 MeV, with a tail extending to lower energies. The flux decreases rapidly with energy.
   - **CNO Neutrinos**: Produced by the CNO cycle, these neutrinos have a harder spectrum, meaning their flux decreases less rapidly with energy compared to B8 neutrinos.

2. **Impact of pp-III Stopping**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in both bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) was a combination of B8 and CNO neutrinos. B8 neutrinos dominated the flux, especially at lower energies.
   - After the pp-III branch stopped, B8 neutrinos are no longer emitted, leaving only CNO neutrinos to contribute to the flux in these bands.

3. **Energy Spectrum Considerations**:
   - B8 neutrinos have a spectrum that decreases rapidly with energy. Thus, the flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) was higher than in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) due to B8 contributions.
   - CNO neutrinos, however, have a harder spectrum, meaning their flux decreases less rapidly with energy. This results in a higher flux in the 800-900 keV band compared to the 700-800 keV band.

4. **Flux Ratio After pp-III Stopping**:
   - After the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in both bands is solely due to CNO neutrinos. Since CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is significantly higher than in band 1 (700-800 keV).
   - The ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 is therefore less than 1. Based on the assumed spectrum of CNO neutrinos, the ratio is estimated to be approximately 0.1.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between the two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stopped is **0.1**.

Answer: D
