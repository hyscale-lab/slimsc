Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The molecule consists of atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. The options are given as A to D.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest energy, which probably refers to the next higher energy state overall. Wait, but what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between these states. The molecule could either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But which transition would be allowed?

In the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The energy for vibration is given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 is the ground state). For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is another name for the rotation-vibration model where the bond length isn't perfectly rigid. But maybe that's a detail here.

So, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be its vibrational ground state (v=0) and rotational ground state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest energy state. The next state could be a higher vibrational state (v=1) and/or a higher rotational state (J=1).

But wait, which transition requires the least energy? The vibrational energy gap is usually much larger than the rotational one. Because the vibrational frequency is given as 4e
