Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle interactions, but let's try to think through this.

The question gives a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). I think this describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermion. The fermion would be ψ_f, and the term suggests that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the boson X can decay into fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions, like f and f-bar. But the fermions must have a mass less than half of X's mass because each would have to have energy less than X's mass divided by 2 (since in the rest frame, each would get m_X/2 each, assuming they are at rest, but actually, it's a bit more involved... Wait, no. The maximum possible mass for each particle is m_X/2 because if each were any heavier, they couldn't come out as decay products. So any fermion pair must have each particle with m < 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but actually, the condition is that the rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for a fermion f and its antiparticle f-bar, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since each is the same mass, each must be less than 3 GeV.

So, which known fermions have masses less than 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Others like the top quark are way beyond 3 GeV.

Wait, but the X boson is 6 GeV, so when it decays into a pair, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV each. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but for a fermion-antifermion pair, each has mass m, so the total is 2m. So 2m must be ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m ≤3 GeV?

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → yes
