Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when high energies are involved. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which is obviously not physical. Regularization introduces a temporary mass or a cutoff to make the integrals finite, then you remove it later, hoping the divergences cancel out. But some theories don't need this because they're already finite or because their structure avoids the divergences naturally.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different because it's a theory of everything, right? Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they vibrate at different frequencies. I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "stringy" cutoff appears, maybe related to the string length or the Planck scale. But wait, do they still need regularization? Or does the theory handle things differently? I'm not sure, but I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions might have better behavior, possibly finite or without the same kind of divergences. Or perhaps they use different methods like dimensional regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbation theory works. But wait, doesn't QCD still require renormalization? Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. So you'd need to regularize those integrals, perhaps using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QCD does require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I remember that QED calculations can have divergent terms, especially in loop diagrams. For instance, the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These divergences are handled through renormalization techniques, which usually involve regularization. So QED definitely
