Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the problem is about a star whose surface temperature changes when dark spots cover part of it. The question is about how the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The options are given, and I have to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem gives the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. Let me think: the ratio is n1/n2. So using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because E2 is higher than E1 (since you go from lower to higher energy when excited), E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponential term would be exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) when considering n_lower/n_upper.

Wait, but the ratio given is the number in level 1 over level 2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? Wait no, because E2 is higher than E1. Let me think again. The energy difference between level 2 and level 1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So n1/n2 would be the inverse of that, so (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, actually, the standard form is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if level 1 is lower in energy than level 2, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait no, because E_i is the energy of state i. So if i is level 1 and j is level 2, then E_i = E1, E_j = E2. So E_i - E_j = E1 - E2 = -(E2-E1). So the exponent becomes - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (E2 - E1)/(k T).

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) )^(-1) ?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me write it correctly. The Boltzmann distribution
