Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy levels in atoms are related to temperature through the Boltzmann distribution. So the Boltzmann factor tells us the probability of atoms being in a certain energy state.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I remember that k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times the temperature factor, but wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is usually written as (g_j/g_i) * (exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )) where g's are the statistical weights. But in this problem, since it's about the excitation relative to another star, maybe we can ignore the statistical weights if it's the same for both stars (since both are iron atoms in the same energy levels).

So for star 1 and star 2, the excitation is twice as much. Let me denote the excitation as N1 and N2. So N1 = 2 N2. But wait, the excitation is proportional to (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Oh, but if the energy difference is the same for both stars, then the ratio N1/N2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) ? Because for star 1, the exponent is -ΔE/(k T1), and for star 2, it's -ΔE/(k T2). So when taking the ratio N1/N2, the exponents subtract.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio N1/N2 would be [ (g_j/g_i) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_j/g_i) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Assuming that the statistical weights g_j and g_i are the same for both stars, they cancel out, so the ratio becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] )

But wait, the ratio is given as N1/N2 = 2. So 2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait a minute, that's the same value as k. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something? Let me compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )=1 K. Oh, that's neat! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

2 = exp( (1 K) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Let me rearrange the terms. 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2). So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, looking at the options, which one matches this equation?

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's exactly what I have. So the correct equation is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the signs. Because when I took the ratio N1/N2 = 2, the equation becomes:

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, that's correct.

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.


The problem involves comparing the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to the Boltzmann constant \( k \). The excitation ratio is \( N_1 / N_2 = 2 \), where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the excitation levels of star_1 and star_2, respectively.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of excitation levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \) and \( N_1 / N_2 = 2 \), the equation becomes:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting the right-hand side:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the equation provided in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
