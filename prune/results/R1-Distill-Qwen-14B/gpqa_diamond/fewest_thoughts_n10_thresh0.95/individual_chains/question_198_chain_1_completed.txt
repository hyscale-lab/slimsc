Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about what each β represents.

Each βn would correspond to the formation of the nth complex. So, β1 is for Co(SCN)n where n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. Wait, wait, actually, I think the notation is that βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. For example, β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on.

The question asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the tetrahedral complex, which is [Co(SCN)4]^2−, but wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, wait. Wait, I should probably clarify the complexes and their colors.

Wait, Co(II) complexes with SCN- can form different structures. The [Co(SCN)4]^2− is a tetrahedral complex and is usually blue, while the [Co(SCN)6]^4− is octahedral and may be another color, but I'm not entirely sure. But for this problem, I think the key is to figure out the distribution of the various complexes based on the stability constants.

So, the problem is about the distribution of Co species in solution, considering the formation of complexes with SCN-. The total Co concentration is 0.01 M, which includes all the possible complexes. But the solution also has 0.1 M SCN-.

The stability constant, β, tells me the tendency of Co(II) to form each complex. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex, and the more likely it is to form.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fractions for the desired species.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up a system where I can use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ion. The general approach involves the formation of each complex step by step, considering the availability of SCN- and Co.

But wait, another thought: the problem might be to find the fraction of the fourth complex, [Co(SCN)4]^2−, which I think is the blue dithiocyanato—wait, wait, no. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups, but in this context, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2−, which is the tetracyano complex.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the nomenclature. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands, but in the options, the question refers to "blue dithiocyanato" which might be [Co(SCN)2]^2+ or perhaps another structure. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the terminology. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)4]^2− as the blue complex, which has four SCN− ligands. But that's a tetra, not di. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the calculations and see.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the distribution among all possible complexes, and the question is about the percentage of the [Co(SCN)4]^2− complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex, but that's a dithiocyanato.

Wait, but the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Hmm. I think that the blue color is more commonly associated with [Co(SCN)4]^2−, which would be a tetra rather than di.

Wait, but perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation without getting stuck on the exact name.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum the required ones.

The species present would be Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)₂^2+, Co(SCN)₃^3+, and Co(SCN)₄^2−.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges. Let's think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1.

So, for each complex:

n = 0: Co^2+ → charge +2.

n=1: CoSCN^+ → charge +1 (since Co²+ + SCN^- → total charge +1).

n=2: Co(SCN)₂ → charge 0 (Co²+ + 2 SCN^- → 2 -2 = 0? No, wait, 2*(-1) is -2. Co²+ is +2. So total is 0. So, complex would be neutral, perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

Wait, but maybe I should just look for the fraction of each species, regardless of charge. Because the formal charge might not be necessary for this calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the formation constants. The stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ; βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, for each n, βn is given. The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, for each n from 1 to 4, we can model the fraction of each complex.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)₃]^− + [Co(SCN)₄]^{2−} } = c = 0.01 M.

But wait, the problem states the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but some of it is tied up in the complexes. However, because SCN- is in excess, the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M. But maybe I should account for the change. Hmm, perhaps for an approximate calculation, assuming that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M is acceptable.

But wait, the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. But when Co forms complexes with SCN, the free SCN^- would decrease. However, if the concentration of Co is 0.01 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher, perhaps the free [SCN^-] is still roughly 0.1 M. So, perhaps I can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M.

So, the approach would be:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, the concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ and the stability constant.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] would be x multiplied by (βn / K), where K depends on the step?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the fractions.

Let me think: the fractions are determined by the product of the stability constants divided by (1 + sum of all such products for each n).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to model the distribution using the formation constants.

Let me consider the distribution of Co among the different complexes. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species.

The fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by f_n = (βn * [SCN]^n) / (denominator), where the denominator is the sum over all m of (βm * [SCN]^m) + [Co^2+].

Wait, but [Co^2+] is x, and the sum is over all n from 0 to 4, where n=0 is Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps another way: the fraction of each species is proportional to βn [SCN]^n.

But wait, in the formation of the complexes, each step involves adding an SCN- to the previous complex.

Wait, okay, perhaps another approach: the overall fraction of each species can be found by considering the ratio of each complex's formation constant relative to the others.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the distribution of complexes based on the stability constants.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / D,

where D is the sum of βm [SCN]^m for m from 0 to 4, with β0 = 1 (since m=0 is the free ion, Co^2+).

Wait, no, because for m=0, the species is Co^2+, and the term would be β0 [SCN]^0. Since β0 is 1 (because the formation constant for the zero complex is 1), and [SCN]^0 is 1, the term is 1.

Then, D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So, D is the sum of all terms, each being βn [SCN]^n, from n=0 to 4.

Then, the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / D.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because for each complex [Co(SCN)_n], the formation constant is βn, which is the equilibrium constant for that complex's formation from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But the total concentration of Co is c = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n}.

So, substituting:

c = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 (βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n )

= [Co^2+] ( 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n )

So, [Co^2+] = c / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n )

But wait, in our case, [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total Co concentration (0.01 M), so perhaps the approximation holds that the free [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M.

So, let's compute each βn [SCN]^n.

Given:

β1 = 9, [SCN] = 0.1 → β1 [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 = 40, → 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 = 63 → 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

β4 = 16 → 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

So, sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = approximately 1.3646.

Then, [Co^2+] = c / (1 + 1.3646) = 0.01 / (2.3646) ≈ 0.004225 M.

Hmm, but wait, that's just [Co^2+], the free ion. But to find the fractions, perhaps I should use the f_n = (βn [SCN]^n ) / D, where D is 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n.

So, D is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So, the fraction f_n for each n:

n=0 (Co^2+): (1) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 or 42.25%.

n=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3808 or 38.08%.

n=2: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 or 16.92%.

n=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 or 2.66%.

n=4: 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000676 or 0.0676%.

So, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but which n corresponds to that?

Wait, let me think about the color again. The [Co(SCN)4]^2- is the tetra complex, which is blue. I think that's the one the question refers to as "blue dithiocyanato" — but wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups, so maybe that's [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is n=2.

Wait, but in this calculation, the fraction for n=2 is 16.92%.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's a D option at 16.9%. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but wait the question says "dithiocyanato", which suggests two SCN- groups. So, that would be n=2.

Wait, so the fraction is 16.92%, which rounds to 16.9%, matching option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fractions.

Wait, let me double-check the fractions.

Compute each f_n:

n=0: 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 → 42.25%.

n=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3808 → 38.08%.

n=2: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692 → 16.92%.

n=3: 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%.

n=4: 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000676 → 0.0676%.

So, the percentage for n=2 is 16.92%, which is option D: 16.9%.

But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So if dithiocyanato is two SCN groups, that's n=2, which is 16.92%, so D is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to [Co(SCN)4]^2− as dithiocyanato, but that doesn't make sense because it's four SCN groups, which would be polythiocyanato.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact terminology. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups, so n=2.

So, the answer would be 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach could be to compute the exact fraction for each complex.

But wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption about [SCN] being 0.1 M. Because when Co forms complexes with SCN, the free [SCN] would decrease. But in the problem, [SCN] is given as 0.1 M. So perhaps the initial assumption that [SCN] is 0.1 M is correct because the problem states that.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Co affects the free [SCN], but since Co is 0.01 M and SCN is 0.1 M, the change in [SCN] due to complexation may be negligible. Let me check.

The maximum amount of SCN that can be tied up is by the highest n, which is 4. So, for all Co in the highest complex, each Co would take 4 SCN. So, total SCN used is 0.01 *4 = 0.04 M. But the initial [SCN] is 0.1 M, which would leave 0.06 M free. But perhaps the assumption is that the free [SCN] is still approximately 0.1 M, given that 0.04 is not too significant compared to 0.1. But for a precise calculation, perhaps I should find the exact [SCN].

However, this would complicate things because the free [SCN] would affect all the βn terms, which would require an iterative approach. But given that the problem provides [SCN] as 0.1 M, perhaps it's intended that we use that value and proceed with the approximation.

So, under this approximation, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck the sum.

Sum of βn [SCN]^n for n=1 to 4:

n=1: 9 *0.1 = 0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063=1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016=1.3646.

So, the denominator D is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So, for n=2, f=0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that:

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

2.3646 × 0.169 = 0.4 (approx). Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169.

2.3646 * 0.169:

2 *0.169=0.338.

0.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.0616.

Total approx 0.338 + 0.0616=0.3996.

Which is close to 0.4, so yes, 0.169 is correct. So 16.9%.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants \( \beta_n \) and the total cobalt concentration \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), with \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the equilibrium constants and the ligand concentration. The general formula for the fraction \( f_n \) of the \( n \)-th complex is:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{D},
\]

where \( D \) is the sum:

\[
D = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n \) for each \( n \)
Given \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \),
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \),
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( D \)
\[
D = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( f_n \) for each \( n \)
The fraction of each species is:
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{D}.
\]

- For \( n = 0 \) (free \( \text{Co}^{2+} \)):
\[
f_0 = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%).
\]

- For \( n = 1 \) (\( \text{CoSCN}^+ \)):
\[
f_1 = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.3808 \, (38.08\%).
\]

- For \( n = 2 \) (\( \text{Co(SCN)}_2^0 \)):
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1692 \, (16.92\%).
\]

- For \( n = 3 \) (\( \text{Co(SCN)}_3^- \)):
\[
f_3 = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%).
\]

- For \( n = 4 \) (\( \text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-} \)):
\[
f_4 = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000676 \, (0.0676\%).
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the results
The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. The term "dithiocyanato" refers to complexes with two \( \text{SCN}^- \) ligands, which corresponds to \( n = 2 \). From the calculations, the fraction of \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2^0 \) is \( f_2 \approx 16.92\% \).

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.

**Answer: D**
