--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars are black bodies and want to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. So, the key here is to find the luminosity ratio. I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius, temperature, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing two stars, the constants might cancel out.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T = b / λ_max is same for both. So T1 = T2. That's important because if T is the same, the luminosity depends only on R².

But wait, hold on. The radial velocities are given. Oh, that's about Doppler shift, right? Because when a star moves towards or away from us, it causes a shift in the observed wavelength. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, it's longer (red shift). 

But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no shift for it. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 is shifted. But wait, the peak wavelengths as observed are the same for both stars. So the rest frame peak wavelength (λ_max) for each star is different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But each star's actual λ_max (in their rest frame) could be different.

So, for Star_2, its rest frame λ_max is different because of the Doppler shift due to its velocity. So we have to account for that to find the actual temperatures.

Wait, how does Doppler shift affect the observed wavelength? The formula for the Doppler effect in light is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

Wait, no, that's the relativistic Doppler shift formula when the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light. But 700 km/s is much slower than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So we can approximate with the non-relativistic formula: λ_observed ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards). But wait, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), so v_r is positive for moving away.

Wait, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. What's the direction? The problem says 0 for Star_1, 700 for Star_2. But since it's a radial velocity, positive could mean moving away, negative towards. But the problem doesn't specify, but for Doppler shift calculation, the sign matters. However, in our case, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So let's model it.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) 

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs

But λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r1=0), and λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

λ_max = b / T ⇒ T = b / λ_max.

So, T1 = b / λ1_rest

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b / (λ1_rest / (1 + v_r2/c )) ) 

Simplify that: T2 = (b (1 + v_r2/c )) / λ1_rest = (1 + v_r2/c ) * (b / λ1_rest) ) = (1 + v_r2/c ) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2's temperature is higher than Star_1's, because it's moving away? Or wait, no. Let me think about the direction.

Wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (so λ_obs > λ_rest). But in our case, λ_obs for Star_2 is same as Star_1's. So Star_2's rest frame λ is shorter than what it would be if it were not moving. So if Star_2 is moving away, its rest λ would be shorter, but observed λ is same as Star_1's. Therefore, Star_2 must have a higher temperature (since λ is shorter).

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully.

Let me denote:

λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 (since v1=0)

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c )

But λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So,

λ_rest,2 = λ_obs,1 / (1 + v2/c )

But from Wien's law:

λ_rest,1 = b / T1

λ_rest,2 = b / T2

So substituting,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c )

Simplify:

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 * T1 * (1 + v2/c ):

T1 (1 + v2/c ) = T2

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but v2 is 700 km/s, which is a radial velocity. But what's the sign? If Star_2 is moving away (positive v), then (1 + v/c) is greater than 1, so T2 is greater than T1. But this would imply that Star_2 is hotter. But from the problem statement, the observed wavelengths are the same.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its λ_obs is longer. But since observed λ for both is the same, Star_2's rest frame λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you move away, the observed λ is longer than the rest frame λ. So if Star_2's rest λ is shorter, then according to Wien's law, T2 is higher than T1.

But wait, let's think about actual numbers. Let's say Star_1's observed λ is λ0. Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ is λ0 = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c ). So λ2_rest is λ0/(1 + v/c ), which is less than λ0. So T2 is higher than T1 because λ is inversely related to temperature.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me plug in some sample numbers. Let's say Star_1 emits at λ_rest = 500 nm. So T1 = b / 500. If Star_2 is moving away at v = 700 km/s, then λ_obs for Star_2 is λ_rest * (1 + v/c ). But if λ_obs = 500 nm, then λ_rest = 500 / (1 + v/c ). So if v is positive (moving away), (1 + v/c ) >1, so λ_rest < 500, which would imply T2 = b / λ_rest = (b / (500/(1 + v/c )) ) = T1 * (1 + v/c ). So T2 is higher than T1.

But wait, the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_2's rest frame λ is shorter than Star_1's. So, in reality, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1 because it's moving away, which makes its observed λ the same as Star_1. So the Doppler shift causes Star_2 to have a higher temperature in its rest frame.

Wait a second, but if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer, but in this case, the observed λ is the same as Star_1. So Star_2's rest λ must be shorter, which makes it hotter.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

But wait, v is 700 km/s. Let me compute the factor. Let's compute v/c.

v = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.023333.

Wait, but then the temperatures are T1 and T2 ≈ 1.023333 T1.

Hmm, but then the luminosity comes into play. Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4; L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We need to find L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) 

= ( (1.5 R2 )² / R2² ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

We have T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c )

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/(1.023333) )^4.

Compute (1 / 1.023333)^4.

Calculate 1.023333^4.

Let me compute 1.023333^2 first.

1.023333 squared is approximately 1.023333 * 1.023333.

Let me compute 1.023333 * 1.023333.

Compute 1.023333 * 1.023333:

= (1 + 0.023333 )^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.023333 + (0.023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721.

Now, square that result again to get to the fourth power: (1.04721)^2.

1.04721^2 ≈ (1 + 0.04721)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.04721 + (0.04721)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.09442 + 0.00223 ≈ 1.09665.

So 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09665.

Then, (1 / 1.023333 )^4 ≈ 1 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.9119.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 1.023333^4 is approximately 1.09665. So 1/1.09665 ≈ 0.9119.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9119.

Compute that:

2.25 * 0.9 is 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0119 ≈ 0.026775.

So total approx 2.025 + 0.026775 ≈ 2.0518.

Wait, that's about 2.05. But the options given are all around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me recheck.

Wait, what's L1 / L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (2.25) R2².

So,

(2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Earlier, I thought T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c )

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (1/(1 + v/c ))^4 = (1.023333)^-4 ≈ 0.9119.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.052.

But the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none of the options match 2.05. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler shift the opposite way. Let me rethink. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength. So when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

In the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ_obs = Star_2's λ_obs.

So, Star_1's λ_rest is same as λ_obs, since v=0.

Star_2's λ_obs is longer than its λ_rest (if moving away) or shorter (if moving towards).

Wait, in the problem, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But the problem doesn't specify direction. So perhaps it's moving towards us. Let's see.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r is negative. Because radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

So, if Star_2 has v_r = -700 km/s, then λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + (-700)/c ) = λ_rest * (1 - 700/c )

So, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c ), but only if it's moving towards us.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for recession velocity (v positive when moving away) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c )

So if v is negative (moving towards), λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + (-v)/c ) = λ_rest (1 - |v|/c )

So, in our problem, Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's, which is λ_rest,1.

So,

λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c ) = λ_rest,1.

Because Star_1's λ_obs is λ_rest,1, and Star_2's λ_obs is λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c ), and both are equal.

So,

λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (1 + v2/c )

Now, using Wien's law, T = b/λ_rest. So,

T1 = b / λ_rest,1

T2 = b / λ_rest,2 = b / ( λ_rest,1 / (1 + v2/c ) ) )

= b * (1 + v2/c ) / λ_rest,1 = (1 + v2/c ) * (b/λ_rest,1 ) = (1 + v2/c ) * T1.

So,

T2 = (1 + v2/c ) * T1.

But now, let's compute.

v2 is 700 km/s. So, v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333.

So,

1 + v2/c = 1.0023333.

Thus,

T2 = 1.0023333 * T1.

So, T2 is a bit higher than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought v was positive for moving away. So if the star is moving away (v positive), then T2 is higher. But if Star_2 is moving towards us (v negative), then 1 + v/c would be less than 1, so T2 would be lower.

Wait, but the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. It doesn't specify the direction. But in the earlier analysis, when we assumed Star_2 was moving away, we get T2 higher than T1. When moving towards, T2 is lower.

But regardless, the observed wavelengths being the same is the key point.

Wait, let's go back. Let's compute the Doppler shift correctly.

The Doppler formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c )

If the source is moving towards, it's λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c )

In our problem, Star_2's observed wavelength is same as Star_1's, which is λ_rest,1.

So,

λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c ) = λ_rest,1 → λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (1 + v2/c )

If v2 is positive (moving away), then denominator is >1, making λ_rest,2 < λ_rest,1, so T2 = b / λ_rest,2 > T1.

Alternatively, if v2 is negative (moving towards), then 1 + v2/c could be less than 1, but if |v2| is 700, then 1 + v2/c could be 1 - (700/c) ≈ 0.9976667.

So λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (0.9976667 ) → λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 * 1.002335.

Which would make T2 = b / λ_rest,2 = (b / λ_rest,1 ) ) * 0.9976667 = T1 * 0.9976667 → T2 < T1.

But in the problem, the observed wavelength is same. So, the direction of velocity affects whether T2 is higher or lower than T1.

But the problem doesn't specify the direction. But let's proceed with the given data. Let's assume that the radial velocity is positive when moving away. So, Star_2 is moving away.

So, going back to the temperature calculation.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c ) = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is 1.002333 * T1.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is:

L1/L2 = ( R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Given R1 =1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

Since T2 = T1 * 1.002333,

(T1/T2) = 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute this: 0.997667^4.

First, compute ln(0.997667) ≈ -0.002338.

Multiply by 4: -0.00935.

e^(-0.00935 ) ≈ 0.9907.

So,

(0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. Looking at the options, D is ~2.23.

But wait, earlier I thought I had a different approach, but got 2.05, but that was when I thought T2 was higher. But that approach was incorrect because I had an error in the Doppler shift direction.

Wait, but in this approach, I get L1/L2 ≈ 2.228, which is about 2.23, option D.

But earlier, I thought when v2 is positive (moving away), T2 is higher. So in that case,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

But T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c ) → (1/1.002333 )^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228, which is option D.

But wait, another possibility is that the calculation is done with v2 being negative, which would make T2 lower than T1.

Wait, let's see. Suppose the radial velocity is negative, meaning moving towards us. So v2 = -700 km/s.

Then,

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + (-700)/c ) = λ_rest,2 * (1 - 700/c )

Because λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

So,

λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (1 - 700/c ) → since 700/c is 0.002333,

1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

So,

λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / 0.997667 ≈ λ_rest,1 * 1.002335.

Thus,

T2 = b / λ_rest,2 = b / (λ_rest,1 * 1.002335 ) = (b / λ_rest,1 ) * (1/1.002335 ) = T1 * 0.997667.

So T2 = 0.997667 T1.

Then,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (T1 / T2 )^4

= 2.25 * (1 / 0.997667 )^4.

Compute (1/0.997667 )^4 → which is (1.00234)^4.

Compute 1.00234^2:

1.00234 * 1.00234 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 1.00468 + 0.00000548 ≈ 1.004685.

Then, square again: (1.004685)^2 ≈ 1.00939.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ approx 1.00939.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.272.

Which is approximately 2.27, but that's not among the options. The options are up to 2.35. The closest would be option B: ~2.32, but that's not exactly.

Hmm, but in the problem statement, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2, but the direction isn't specified. So, perhaps the original assumption was correct that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower luminosity ratio of about 2.23.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is being considered in a different way. Maybe the stars have the same observed wavelength maximum, so the rest wavelengths are adjusted by their velocities.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength maximum is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but that's the relativistic formula. However, if v is much smaller than c, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is small and positive for moving away.

But perhaps the correct approach is to compute the temperature ratio correctly, considering whether the star is moving towards or away.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the temperature in their rest frames.

Let me restate:

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, since v1=0.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c ), assuming v2 is positive for moving away.

But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v2/c )

→ λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c )

From Wien's law, T = b / λ_rest.

So,

T1 = b / λ_rest1,

T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / ( λ_rest1 / (1 + v2/c ) ) = (1 + v2/c ) * (b/λ_rest1 ) = (1 + v2/c ) * T1.

So, T2 = (1 + v2/c ) T1.

So, if v2 is positive (moving away), T2 is larger than T1.

So, the temperature ratio is T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Now, the luminosity ratio is:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (1/(1 + v2/c )) )^4.

Given v2 is 700 km/s, v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.0023333.

So,

(1 + v2/c ) = 1.0023333.

So,

(1/(1.0023333 ))^4 = (approx 0.997667)^4.

As before, this is approximately 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, another thing: the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So we're computing L1/L2, which is 2.23. So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem provides the following key details:

1. **Radius**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\).
2. **Radial velocities**: \(v_1 = 0\) (Star_1 is stationary), \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity).
3. **Observed wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\).

### Step 1: Relating Rest Wavelengths and Temperatures
Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)), the observed wavelength is the rest wavelength: \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\).

For Star_2 (\(v_2 \neq 0\)), the observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}\):

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

Using the inverse relationship between wavelength and temperature (\(T \propto 1/\lambda\)):

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

From Step 1, \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\). Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx 0.997667
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
