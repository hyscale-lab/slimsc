Okay, let's tackle this neutrino flux question. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think this through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are fine. We need to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the pp-III reaction is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. The pp chain is the main source of energy for the Sun, right? The pp-I, II, and III are different stages of this chain. Specifically, pp-III is where a carbon-12 nucleus captures two protons in a triple-alpha reaction, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, the pp chain is the fusion of protons into helium-4. The pp-III branch involves the carbon-12 nucleus capturing two protons, which then beta decays into nitrogen-14, and then another proton capture and another decay to form carbon-16... Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I think the pp-III process is when three helium nuclei (He-3) fuse into carbon-12, but that's the triple-alpha process, which is part of the CNO cycle. No, wait, the pp chain is different. Let me get this straight.

The pp chain steps: Initially, two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fuse to form deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3. Then, either two He-3 can fuse into He-4 plus two protons (the pp-I branch), or a He-3 can capture a proton to form C-12 (pp-II), which then can capture another proton (pp-III) to form N-14, which then decays? Or maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the pp chain has different branches. The main ones are pp-I and pp-II and pp-III. The pp-I is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons. The pp-II goes He-3 + p → C-12 (beta decay?), and then the pp-III is C-12 + p → N-13, which beta decays to C-14, but wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, I think the pp-III branch is where C-12 captures a proton to become N-13, which then decays into C-13 via beta decay. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing with the CNO cycle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about neutrino production. The pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain that produces neutrinos. The neutrinos come from the beta decay steps in the chain. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of certain neutrinos would be affected.

The question says that the pp-III branch has stopped. So, all other reactions continue, which I think includes the other parts of the pp chain, like pp-I and pp-II, as well as the CNO cycle.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun via several processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain (pp) and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain is the dominant source of solar energy and neutrinos in the Sun. The CNO cycle contributes less but is more significant at higher temperatures.

In the pp chain, neutrinos are produced in two main ways: the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the main pp reaction. The pep reaction is a branch where two protons and an electron annihilate to produce a neutron and positron, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the main pp reaction is pp → He-4, producing two positrons and two neutrinos. Wait, no, each beta decay in the chain produces a neutrino. Specifically, in the pp chain, each He-3 produced in the first steps undergoes two possible reactions: either pair up to form He-4 (pp-I), or capture a proton (pp-II and pp-III).

In the pp-I reaction (He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2p), this produces two protons and some energy. But where do the neutrinos come from? Oh right, in the pp chain, each time a beta decay occurs, a neutrino is emitted. For example, in the step where He-3 captures a proton to form C-12, that's the pp-II branch. Then, C-12 captures another proton to form N-13, which then beta decays to C-13, emitting a neutrino. That's part of the pp-III branch.

So, the pp-III branch involves a proton capture by C-12, leading to N-13, which decays via beta emission. That's one of the steps that produces neutrinos. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those specific neutrinos would stop.

But wait, the question is about the fluxes of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. Neutrinos from different processes have different energies. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones.

Wait, but in the Sun, the dominant neutrino flux comes from the pp chain, and the CNO contributes a smaller portion. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies because the temperatures required for the CNO reactions are higher, so they come from the hotter, denser core regions where the temperature is higher.

But wait, in this scenario, the pp-III branch stops. So, the production of neutrinos from that specific part of the pp chain would stop. What does that mean for the flux in the two bands?

The neutrinos from the pp-III branch—what energies do they have? I think the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than those from the pp chain. For example, the CNO neutrinos typically have energies around several MeV, while the pp neutrinos are a few keV to maybe 100s of keV.

Wait, oh, but the bands given in the question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. These are in the hundreds of keV range. So, perhaps these are from the higher-energy end of the pp neutrinos or from the CNO.

Wait, the main pp neutrinos are from the pep reaction and the main pp reaction. The main pp reaction produces two neutrinos, each with an energy up to about 400 keV. The pep reaction produces neutrinos with lower energies, around 1-2 keV. So, the main pp neutrinos are in the ~500 keV range? Or perhaps around 400 keV.

But the pp-III branch, which is a branch of the pp chain, may contribute neutrinos in higher energy ranges. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have higher energies than the main pp neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in the ~500-700 keV range. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So, in the pp chain, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos stops. But the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) continue. So, the main source of neutrinos from the pp chain would still be active, but the pp-III neutrinos are no longer being produced.

But what about the CNO cycle? The CNO cycle is another source of neutrinos. So, the CNO neutrinos are produced via the reactions in the CNO cycle, which include processes with higher temperatures, hence higher-energy neutrinos.

In this scenario, all other reactions remain as they were. So, the CNO reactions continue, and their neutrino production also continues.

So, the neutrino fluxes from the pp chain and the CNO cycle contribute to the total.

So, the question is about the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux(band1)/flux(band2).

What determines the flux in each band? Well, the flux depends on the number of neutrinos emitted in each energy range.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, stopping their production would reduce the flux in those bands more than in lower ones.

But wait, let me think again: the CNO neutrinos have higher energies. If the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV band, and the CNO neutrinos are in 800-900 keV, then stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in the 700-800 band, but the CNO flux remains the same. So, the ratio would be (flux_pp_band1 + flux_cno_band1) / (flux_pp_band2 + flux_cno_band2). Wait, no. Because I think the CNO and pp neutrinos are in different energy ranges. So, perhaps band1 (700-800) would have neutrinos from the pp chain and the CNO, while band2 (800-900) would be higher energies, perhaps dominated by CNO.

Wait, perhaps the pp chain neutrinos are in lower energy ranges. For example, the main pp neutrinos are around 400 keV, while the CNO neutrinos are higher, like 1 MeV and above. So maybe the pp neutrinos don't reach 700 keV, except perhaps in the higher end.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy than the main pp neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the highest energy neutrinos from the pp chain would stop, but the lower-energy ones would still be produced.

So, in band1 (700-800), perhaps the neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain, and in band2 (800-900), they might be from the CNO cycle.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact energy ranges. Let me try to recall. The main solar neutrinos from the pp chain have energies up to about 1-4 MeV? Wait, no, that's not right. I think the main pp neutrinos are in the range of about 100 keV to 1 MeV, but more precisely, the majority are in the 100s of keV to low MeV range. The CNO neutrinos are higher, up to several MeV.

Wait, maybe I should get some numbers. Let's see: The main pp neutrinos are from the reaction where a proton captures a positron and emits a neutron (pep reaction), which produces a neutrino with energy up to about 1.4 MeV. The main pp reaction produces two neutrinos per He-4 nucleus, each with energies up to about 0.4 MeV (400 keV) each. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

No, perhaps the main pp process produces neutrinos with energies of about 0.2-0.4 MeV (200-400 keV), while the pep process produces higher-energy neutrinos, up to around 1.4 MeV.

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The main pp reaction (pp → He-4 + e+ + ν_e) produces two neutrinos per He-4, each with energy up to around 0.4 MeV. The pep reaction (p + e- → e+ + ν_e + ν_e_bar?) produces a single neutrino with energy up to about 1.4 MeV.

So, the main pp neutrinos (from the main pp reaction) are in the 0.2-0.4 MeV range, and the pep neutrinos are higher, up to 1.4 MeV. The CNO neutrinos are even higher, up to a few MeV.

So, the neutrinos from the pp chain (both main pp and pep) are in the 0.2-1.4 MeV range, and CNO are higher.

But the question's bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So, these are in the high end of the pp neutrinos and the very low end of the CNO neutrinos.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, and the CNO neutrinos start around 1 MeV and above, then if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band1 (700-800) would be lower because that band was previously getting some contribution from the pp-III neutrinos, but the CNO neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would still be present.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band1 to band2. So, what's the flux in each band?

Assuming that before stopping the pp-III branch, the flux in band1 (700-800) had contributions from both pp and CNO, but perhaps more from the pp-III. The flux in band2 (800-900) would have more CNO neutrinos.

After the pp-III stops, the pp contribution to band1 is gone. So, the flux in band1 would be lower than before, and band2's flux remains the same (since CNO is still active).

So, the ratio would be (flux_cno_band1 + flux_pp_band1) / (flux_cno_band2 + flux_pp_band2). But wait, if the pp-III is only contributing to band1, then post-stop, band1 would have less.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, and CNO are in band2.

In that case, before the stop:

- Band1: pp-III neutrinos (maybe a significant portion) and some CNO.
- Band2: mostly CNO.

After the stop:

- Band1: only CNO (or perhaps negligible pp, if pp-III was the main source in that band).
- Band2: all CNO.

But wait, the CNO neutrinos would be in higher energy ranges, so maybe band2 (800-900 keV) is where CNO neutrinos start, and band1 (700-800) is where the pp-III neutrinos are.

If that's the case, then before the stop, band1 had both pp-III and some CNO. After the stop, band1 would have only CNO (if pp-III was the main source there), and band2 would have CNO as usual.

So, the flux in band1 would decrease, and band2 remains the same.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. Before the stop, band1 had more from pp (since CNO starts at higher energies), perhaps. Or maybe the CNO contributes more to higher bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a broad spectrum, so some of them are in band1 and band2. But the main bulk is higher.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the typical solar neutrino flux.

The total solar neutrino flux is about 6×10^10 per cm² per second. The main contributors are the pp chain (about 90% of the flux) and the CNO cycle (about 8-9%).

The pp neutrinos have energies up to about 1.4 MeV (pep reaction), while the CNO neutrinos go up to 10 MeV and above.

So, the 700-800 keV band is in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, which is within the range of the main pp neutrinos (0.2-1.4 MeV) and the lower end of the CNO neutrinos (which start around 1 MeV and go up).

But the CNO neutrinos are a small fraction of the total flux, about 8-9%.

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, and it was a source of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band, then the flux in that band would decrease.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band1 (700-800), and the CNO neutrinos start contributing more in band2 (800-900), then before the stop, band1 had a lot of pp neutrinos and some CNO. After the stop, band1 would have only CNO neutrinos in that range, but the CNO flux in band1 is itself a small part of the total.

So, the question is, how does the ratio (flux1/flux2) change?

Wait, the scenario is that the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the surface. So, the neutrinos from the current core reactions (without pp-III) would have reached us now, while the neutrinos from the pp-III process before 8.5 minutes ago would still be in transit if they were emitted in that time. Or perhaps, the ones emitted 8.5 minutes ago are just arriving, so the current neutrino flux is from the reactions after the pp-III stopped.

Hmm, perhaps the neutrinos are produced and take about 8.5 minutes to reach us. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted during that time are arriving now. But wait, I'm not entirely sure how this affects the current flux.

Wait, the question states that the pp-III stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to the surface. So, any neutrinos emitted from the core before that time would have already reached us. So, the flux we're measuring now is the flux from the core as it currently is (without pp-III), and any changes would reflect the current state.

So, the neutrino flux we observe now is from the Sun's current reactions, which have the pp-III branch stopped. So, the neutrinos that are arriving now are from the current core, which no longer has pp-III.

So, the flux we're considering is the current one, with pp-III stopped.

Thus, the question is, under these conditions, what is the ratio of flux in band1 (700-800) to band2 (800-900).

If the pp-III neutrinos were significant in band1, and CNO in band2, then the flux in band1 would be lower than if pp-III were active. But how much lower?

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos were a significant fraction of band1, say, 50% of the flux in band1, and the CNO neutrinos contributed about 10% to the total flux, but perhaps a higher fraction in the higher bands.

Alternatively, let's think that the pp-III contributes a certain amount to band1, and CNO contributes to both bands.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a broader energy spectrum, but their flux is lower. So, in band1, the majority of neutrinos come from the pp chain, with a small contribution from CNO. In band2, the majority comes from CNO, with perhaps some high-energy pp neutrinos.

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, which contributes to the higher-energy pp neutrinos, then band1 would lose some of its pp contribution, and band2 would lose any pp contributions there.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this with an approximate model.

Let's suppose that the pp-III neutrinos contribute a certain fraction to band1 (700-800 keV) and perhaps a small fraction to band2 (800-900 keV), while the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band2.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are a significant fraction of the band1 flux, say, 70% before the stop. Then, CNO contributes say, 30% in band1 and 70% in band2.

After the pp-III stops, the pp contribution to band1 drops to zero, so band1 flux is now CNO's 30%. Band2 is still at CNO's 70%.

So, the ratio before would be (0.7pp +0.3CNO_band1) / (0.2pp +0.8CNO_band2). But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp neutrinos (including pp-III) are the main source in band1, and the CNO in band2. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in band1 would drop, while band2 remains the same.

In that case, the ratio would be (pp_band1 - pp_III_band1) / CNO_band2.

But without knowing the exact fractions, it's challenging.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are negligible in band2, and the CNO dominates band2, then the ratio would be (flux_band1_after) / (flux_band2_after) = (flux_band1_pp + flux_band1_CNO) / (flux_band2_CNO).

But without knowing how much each contributes, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: in the standard solar model, the CNO neutrinos contribute about 8-9% of the total flux. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are a part of the pp chain, which contributes about 90%.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are a fraction of the pp neutrinos, say, 10% of the total. Then, pp neutrinos are 90% of the total flux, so pp-III is 9% of the total flux. So, if the pp-III stops, the total pp neutrinos would decrease by 10%, so the total neutrinos would decrease by about 9% (since CNO remains the same).

But how does this affect the flux in the two bands?

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, and CNO in band2. So, before the stop, band1 had 90% (pp) and 8% (CNO), so band1 is dominated by pp. Band2 is mostly CNO, say 8% of the total flux.

After the stop, band1's pp contribution drops by 10% of the pp, which is 9% of the total. So, band1 would have (90% -9%) =81% of the total.

Wait, no. Because the pp neutrinos include both the main pp and the pp-III. If pp-III is part of the pp neutrinos, then the pp neutrinos would lose a fraction of their contribution. So, perhaps the pp neutrinos are 90% of the total, of which, say, 10% are from pp-III. So, if pp-III stops, the pp neutrinos go from 90% to 81% of the total.

But then, the CNO remains at 8-9%.

So, in band1, which is mainly pp neutrinos, the flux would be 81% * some fraction, while band2 is mainly CNO.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the key is to realize that the pp-III neutrinos are in a higher energy band, but if they're stopped, the high-energy band (band2) would have less contribution from pp, but more from CNO. Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos are the main contributors to band2, and band1 gets more from the pp chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are part of the main pp neutrino flux. So, their stopping would reduce the pp contribution in higher energy ranges, which might affect band1 and band2.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in band1 (700-800 keV). Without them, the flux in band1 decreases, while band2 (800-900) remains the same because it's dominated by CNO.

If that's the case, the flux ratio would decrease because band1 is lower.

But without knowing the exact fractions, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the CNO neutrinos make up a small fraction (say, 10%) of the total flux, but their energy spectrum is such that they contribute significantly to higher energy bands.

So, band1 (700-800) would have most of its flux from pp, and band2 (800-900) from CNO.

If the pp-III stops, and the pp neutrinos in band1 drop, then flux_band1 becomes lower, while flux_band2 remains the same.

So, the ratio band1/band2 would be (pp_flux_band1) / (cno_flux_band2).

Assuming that pp_flux_band1 is, say, 10 times larger than cno_flux_band2, the ratio would be around 10. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are a major part of band1, perhaps the ratio is higher than 1.

Wait, another approach: solar neutrino experiments have measured that the total neutrino flux is lower than predicted by the Standard Solar Model, which was the solar neutrino problem. But that's due to neutrino oscillations, which the question says not to consider.

So, assuming no oscillations, and the pp-III stops.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then without them, band1's flux would drop by a significant amount. So the ratio of (flux_band1)/(flux_band2) would be much lower.

Wait, but in the standard model, what fraction of the total neutrino flux is in each band?

If most neutrinos are from the pp chain, with lower energies, and CNO are a small fraction with higher energies.

So, band1 (700-800 keV) would have a lot of pp neutrinos.

Band2 (800-900 keV) would have some pp and mostly CNO.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, their stopping would reduce band1's flux.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are a significant fraction of the pp neutrinos, say 50%, then band1's flux would drop by 50% (since pp makes up 90% of the total), and band2's flux remains the same.

So, if before, band1 was 81% (90% pp, 700-800) and band2 was 9% (CNO, 800-900), the ratio would be 81/9 = 9. After the pp-III stops, band1 is 40.5% (half of 81%) and band2 remains 9%. The new ratio is 40.5/9 = 4.5, which is about 5. But this isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are only a small fraction of the total. Suppose the pp-III contributes about 1% of the total neutrino flux. So, stopping them would reduce the total flux by 1%, but the flux in band1 would drop by that amount.

But without knowing the exact energy distribution, perhaps the correct approach is to think that after the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in band1 (which relies on pp-III) would drop, while band2 (which relies more on CNO) remains the same. So, the ratio would be much lower.

Looking at the options, the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the pp-III neutrinos are a major part of band1, the ratio would drop significantly. For example, if band1 used to have 10 times as much as band2, the ratio would be 10. If the pp-III stops, and band1's flux drops by a factor of 10, the ratio would be 1 (option C). Or if it drops by a factor of 10 and band2 remains same, ratio could be 0.1 (option D).

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the energy ranges and the sources. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the main pp process.

The main pp neutrinos (from the main pp reaction) are around 0.4 MeV (400 keV). The pep reaction produces up to 1.4 MeV. The pp-III branch's neutrinos would be from reactions that require higher energies, perhaps around 0.7-0.8 MeV.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, then stopping them would mean that band1's flux is now only from CNO, while band2 is from CNO as well.

But the CNO neutrinos are in higher energies, so band2 would have more CNO flux than band1. So, the ratio band1/band2 would be (CNO_band1) / (CNO_band2).

But since CNO neutrinos have a broad spectrum, the flux in each band would depend on the shape of their spectrum.

Assuming that the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that's higher in band2 than in band1, then the ratio would be less than 1.

But without knowing the exact distribution, perhaps the best way is to think that the flux in band1 was dominated by pp-III, which is gone. So, band1's flux is now much lower than before, and band2's is still high.

So, the ratio (band1/band2) would be much less than 1. Looking at the options, 0.1 is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a similar number in both bands, but I think higher in band2 than band1.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos were a significant part of band1, and band2 is mostly CNO, then the ratio would be (band1_pp_III) / band2_CNO.

If band1_pp_III was 10 times band2_CNO, the ratio would be 10. But after pp-III stops, band1 would be zero, so the ratio would be zero. But that's not an option.

Wait, no, because the CNO neutrinos are present. So, band1 would have some CNO flux, and band2 would have more.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band2 than to band1. So, the ratio (band1_CNO) / (band2_CNO) would be, say, 0.1. Because CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum, but the majority are at higher energies.

If before the stop, band1 was dominated by pp-III (say, 90% of band1 is pp-III, 10% CNO), and band2 was 90% CNO, 10% pp-III.

After the stop, band1's flux is 10% of what it was (only CNO), and band2's is same (90% CNO, 10% pp-III, but pp-III is gone, so band2 is 90% CNO).

Wait, but pp-III was stopped, so band2's pp-III contribution is gone. So, band2's flux is CNO.

So, in band1, after the stop, the flux is CNO_band1, which is 10% of the original band1. In band2, the flux is CNO_band2, which is 90% of the original band2.

But wait, not exactly. Because the total CNO flux is fixed. If CNO neutrinos are spread across the higher bands, then the flux in band1 (CNO) would be a small fraction, and band2 would have a larger fraction.

For example, if the CNO neutrinos are distributed such that 10% are in band1 and 90% in band2, then after the pp-III stops:

band1_flux = 0.1 (CNO_band1)
band2_flux = 0.9 (CNO_band2)

So, the ratio would be 0.1/0.9 ≈ 0.111, which is approximately 0.1. So, the answer would be D) 0.1.

That makes sense. So, the ratio would be around 0.1.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV, band 1, and 800-900 keV, band 2) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in specific energy ranges, and its cessation affects the flux in band 1 more significantly than in band 2. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources in the Sun**:
   - The pp chain is the dominant source of solar neutrinos, contributing approximately 90% of the total flux.
   - The pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain that produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges, likely in the 700-800 keV range.
   - The CNO cycle contributes the remaining ~10% of the neutrino flux, with higher-energy neutrinos typically in the 1 MeV and above range.

2. **Energy Bands and Contributions**:
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV): Dominated by neutrinos from the pp-III branch, with a smaller contribution from the CNO cycle.
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV): Primarily dominated by CNO neutrinos, with minimal contribution from the pp chain.

3. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in band 1. Its cessation reduces the flux in band 1 significantly.
   - The CNO neutrinos remain unaffected and continue to dominate band 2.

4. **Flux Ratio Before and After the pp-III Stop**:
   - Before the stop, band 1 had a higher flux due to the significant contribution from the pp-III branch, while band 2 was dominated by CNO neutrinos.
   - After the stop, band 1's flux is reduced to only the CNO contribution, while band 2's flux remains unchanged.

5. **Estimating the Ratio**:
   - The CNO neutrinos have a broader energy spectrum, with a smaller fraction in band 1 and a larger fraction in band 2.
   - Assuming the CNO neutrinos contribute approximately 10% to band 1 and 90% to band 2, the flux ratio after the pp-III stop becomes:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Flux (band 1, CNO)}}{\text{Flux (band 2, CNO)}} = \frac{0.1}{0.9} \approx 0.1
     \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops is approximately **0.1**.
