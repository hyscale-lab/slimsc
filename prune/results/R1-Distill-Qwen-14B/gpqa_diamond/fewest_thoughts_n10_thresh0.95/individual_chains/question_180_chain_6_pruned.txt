Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just electric potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I'm trying to find the minimum potential energy here. Because potential energy is related to the configuration of the charges, right? And since the system is isolated, I'll just consider the potential energy between all pairs of charges.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Well, for a system of charges, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for n charges, it's the sum over each pair of (k * q1 * q2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

In this case, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. Also, the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some way that affects the distance between themselves?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. Does that mean they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m around P? If so, their mutual distances would depend on their positions on the sphere. But since the problem is about the minimum energy, I think we can assume that the 12 charges are placed in such a way that the potential energy between them is minimized. How?

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minimum energy of the entire system. So the total potential energy will be the sum of energies between each pair. There are two contributions: the 13th charge (at P) interacting with each of the 12 charges, and the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Let me break it down.

First, the energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges. Since each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, each pair contributes the same amount.

Each of these 12 charges is 2e. The 13th is 2e as well. So each pair contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, m? No, the distance is 2 meters, so r is 2. So each such pair contributes (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Wait, wait. Let's compute that. Let me write this:

The energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is (k * q1 * q2) / r. Here, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e. So each of the 12 charges contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2. So the total for all 12 is 12 times that.

So, part one: 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2 ].

Now, part two: the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, but how far are they from each other? Hmm. Because they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two charges can vary. But the problem is about the minimum energy. So arranging the charges to minimize the potential energy.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy depends on the distances between each pair. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be placed as far apart as possible. Because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the potential energy, they should be arranged in a way that maximizes the distances between each other.

Wait, but wait a minute. For a group of positive charges, the configuration with the lowest potential energy is when they are as far apart as possible. So for 12 charges, the most symmetrical arrangement would be the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but perhaps in this case, on a sphere. But calculating the exact distances between all pairs in such a configuration is complicated.

But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate that. Because in the problem statement, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. But their mutual distances aren't specified. So how can I find the minimum energy? Because the mutual potential energy depends on their arrangement.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m, but their exact positions can vary on that sphere. To find the minimum energy of the system, we need the configuration that minim
