Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these titration calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part.

First, let me visualize what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll neutralize each other in a titration. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Wait, but before that, I need to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Because the initial solution is being diluted with equal volumes, right? So when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will be halved because concentration is moles over volume.

So, the initial concentration of acetic acid before titration would be (0.05 M) * (20 cm³) divided by (40 cm³). Let me compute that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1 / 40 = 0.0125 M? Wait wait, 0.05 *20=1 mmol (since 1 cm³ is 1 mL, and 0.05 M times 20 mL is 1 millimole). Then after dilution, it's 1 mmol in 40 mL, so 0.025 M. Oh right! Because 1 mmol / 40 mL = 0.025 M. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let's tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach that point.

The moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: volume is 40 cm³, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = 0.025 * 40 = 1 mmol. Because 0.025 M is 0.025 mol/L = 0.025 mmol/mL. 40 mL * 0.025 = 1 mmol. So moles of NaOH needed is also 1 mmol because the reaction is 1:1.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration. So 1 mmol / 0.1 M = 10 mL of NaOH. So at equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the question is about pH at equivalence and at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is at 10 mL, 25% would be 2.5 mL added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So when you add 25% of that volume, that means you've added 2.5 mL of NaOH. So, what is the situation here?

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution will be a buffer solution—a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

Let me outline the steps.

First, compute the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution. That's 1 mmol, as before.

When we add V mL of NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * V (in liters). Wait, but since V is in cm³, which is mL, 0.1 M is 0.1 mmol per mL. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 * V.

At 25% titration, V is 2.5 mL. So moles NaOH = 0.1 * 2.5 = 0.25 mmol.

So, the reaction consumes 0.25 mmol of acetic acid and produces 0.25 mmol of acetate.

So the moles of acetic acid remaining: 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol.

The moles of acetate formed: 0.25 mmol.

The total volume of the solution is initial volume (40 mL) plus NaOH added (2.5 mL) = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to work in mmol because the volume is in mL.

So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 mL = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 mmol / 42.5 mL ≈ 0.005882 M.

Then, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. Wait, no, wait. pKa is -log(Ka). So 1.85e-5 is Ka. So pKa is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is about 0.267 more than 1, so 5 - 0.267 ≈ 4.733).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's approximately 4.25, which is close to option A's first value 4.26. But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, for the moles: initial acetic acid is 1 mmol. NaOH added is 0.25 mmol, so acetic acid left is 0.75 mmol, acetate is 0.25 mmol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 42.5 cm³.

So [HA] = 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.25 /42.5 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) = approximately 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is 4.25, or perhaps 4.26 when rounded, but let's see if the calculation is more precise.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the ratio more accurately.

Wait, 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3, exactly. So the ratio is 1/3, so the log is log(1/3) = -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which rounds to 4.25. So the pH at 25% is about 4.25, which is close to 4.26 as in option A.

Now, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution is now a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 1 mmol (same as initial acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL.

So [CH3COO^-] = 1 mmol / 50 mL = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.4054e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small).

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.4054e-10.

Solving for x: x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check where I might have messed up.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the Kb. Wait, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, that's correct. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054e-9 = 5.4054e-10. That looks correct.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So:

 Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x² / (0.02) = 5.4054e-10.

So x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) = about 4.98. So pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH of around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, which doesn't match. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option B has 3.17 and 6.73. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the solution is at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a basic solution. So the pH should be higher than 7.

Wait, but my calculation gave 9.02, which is higher. But none of the options have pH at equivalence over 8.

Wait, the options: option A's equivalence is 8.52. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me compute the Kb again.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.4054e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So the expression is:

x²/(0.02) = 5.4054e-10 → x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11 → x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) = 5 - log(1.04) ≈ 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. So pH = 9.017.

But none of the options have a pH of 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps at equivalence, the solution is not just the acetate ion, but maybe I should consider the dilution correctly.

Wait, when I added 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL of solution, the total volume is 50 mL. So the concentration of acetate is (1 mmol) / (50 mL) = 0.02 M. So that part is right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution. The pH can be calculated using pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA]), but wait, no, at equivalence, all the HA is converted to A^-, so [HA] is negligible. So the solution is dominated by the hydrolysis of A^-.

Another approach: maybe I can calculate the concentration of H+ ions directly.

The hydrolysis equation is: A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

The Kb is 5.4054e-10.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, [A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. [HA] = x. [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02) = 5.4054e-10 → x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11 → x = 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, let me double-check the initial moles.

The initial solution after dilution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol. Correct.

At equivalence, all 1 mmol reacts with 1 mmol NaOH. So the NaOH added is 10 mL, since 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.01 L * 0.1 M = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for pH.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate x as negligible, but perhaps it's not needed since x is so small compared to 0.02.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact calculation, but that's probably not necessary.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach earlier, but that seems correct for the 25% titration.

Looking at the options, the first part (25% titration) is around 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26 and option D's 4.57. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the 25% part.

Wait, the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point. So equivalence is at 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL NaOH.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol = 0.25 mmol.

So, initial moles of acetic acid are 1 mmol. After adding 0.25 mmol of NaOH, we have:

Moles of acetic acid: 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 mmol.

Moles of acetate: 0.25 mmol.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL.

So, [HA] = 0.75 / 42.5 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.25 /42.5 ≈ 0.005882 M.

The ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 -0.477 ≈4.253.

Which is approximately 4.25. So the first value in option A is 4.26, which is close.

Now for the equivalence point, I calculated pH as about 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in Kb. Let me recheck:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.73.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = ?

Wait, 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is 1e-14 * 1/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = 0.54054e-9 = 5.4054e-10. That's correct.

So, the Kb is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately. Let me compute x with more precision.

x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5).

Wait, log(1.04) is approximately 0.017. So log(1.04e-5)= log(1.04) + log(1e-5) = 0.017 -5 → pOH=4.983.

pH=14-4.983=9.017. That's about 9.02, but no options have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate, but perhaps I missed dilution? Or perhaps I should consider that the acetate comes from a strong base, so the solution is a buffer?

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it's basic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value without approximations. Let me set up the equation without assuming x is negligible.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.4054e-10.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, the approximation holds, but perhaps to be precise, I can write the quadratic equation.

x² +5.4054e-10 * x - (0.02 *5.4054e-10) =0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The equation is x² = Kb * (0.02 - x).

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me solve for x more accurately.

Let me write the equation x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - Kb *0.02 =0.

Plugging in Kb =5.4054e-10:

x² + (5.4054e-10)x - (5.4054e-10 * 0.02) =0.

The quadratic equation: x² + (5.4054e-10)x - 1.08108e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.4054e-10, c= -1.08108e-11.

So, discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.4054e-10)^2 +4*1*1.08108e-11.

Calculate each term:

(5.4054e-10)^2 ≈ (5.4054)^2 *1e-20 = 29.215e-20 = 2.9215e-19.

4ac =4 *1*(-1.08108e-11) → Wait, no, because c is -1.08108e-11, so 4ac =4* ( -1.08108e-11 )= -4.3243e-11. But in the discriminant, it's +4ac because the equation is ax² +bx + c=0. So actually, c is -1.08108e-11, so 4ac =4*(1)*(-1.08108e-11) → no, wait, a=1, c= -1.08108e-11, so 4ac=4*(1)*(-1.08108e-11)
