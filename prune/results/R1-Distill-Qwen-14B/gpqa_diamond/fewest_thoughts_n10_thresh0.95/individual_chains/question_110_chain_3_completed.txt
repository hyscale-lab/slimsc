Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

The question is about the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. The key point is to determine which stars are bright enough to be observed by both. From what I remember, both observatories have high-resolution spectrographs, but their brightness limits are different.

The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So anything with apparent V magnitude ≤17 is detectable by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", meaning that the apparent magnitude has to be less than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, a star with apparent V of 16 mag is brighter than 17, so it can be seen. But a star with 18 mag can't be seen by ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent V must be less than 16. So anything above 16 mag is not observable with HIRES. So a star that's, say, 15.5 mag in V is okay for both, because 15.5 <16 and 15.5<17.

So the stars that can be detected by both instruments must have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16) and ≤17 (but that's less restrictive than HIRES's 16).

Wait, no: ESPRESSO can do up to 17, so any star that meets HIRES's limit (<=16) will automatically meet ESPRESSO's. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V must be <=16.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V >17 can't be observed. So the limit is stars with V brighter than 17 mag (so V <17). HIRES can go up to 16, so for a star to be detected by both, it must have V apparent ≤16. Because that's the stricter condition.

So, now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which are <=16.

Wait, but some stars are given absolute magnitudes and distance, so I'll need to compute their apparent magnitude using the distance modulus.

The distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5, where d is distance in parsecs. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

But wait, some stars also have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects the apparent magnitude. Because interstellar dust causes extinction, making stars appear dimmer (higher apparent magnitude) in the V band. The formula for extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because as extinction increases, the apparent magnitude increases (since it's dimmer).

So for each star, if it has an E(B-V), we need to calculate A_V and add it to the apparent magnitude calculated without extinction.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc.

No E(B-V) mentioned, so no extinction.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10, log10(10)=1.

So m =15.5 +5(1) -5 =15.5 +5-5 =15.5.

So apparent V is 15.5. Since 15.5 <16, it's within both ESPRESSO (<=17) and HIRES (<=16). So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's apparent V is <=17 (brighter than 17). So 15.5 is brighter than 17, so yes, detectable.

HIRES can detect up to 16. 15.5 <16, so Star1 is detectable by both.

So Star1 is a candidate.

Now Star2: apparent V magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, is that the apparent magnitude already? The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance." So no need to calculate. So m=16.5.

Wait, but can it be detected by both? HIRES requires m <=16, but 16.5 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star2 is not in the list.

Star3: RA and DEC, but more importantly, apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So we have to account for extinction.

A_V =3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but wait: the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. Oh wait, no, I think I misread. The star's given is apparent V magnitude, but that's without extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude? Hmm, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag and located at 15 pc."

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So wait, that can't be right because E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects the observed magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Maybe Star3's given apparent V is the intrinsic value, and we have to calculate the observed one. Or perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction, so the observed would be brighter (higher number). Wait, no. Extinction makes stars look dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher than the intrinsic.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent V is the actual observed magnitude. In that case, E(B-V) might not factor in. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me read the question again. For Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but E(B-V) is also provided. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, and the E(B-V) is the color excess. But why would E(B-V) be given again? Hmm, maybe the given m is the absolute magnitude or something else.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. The apparent V magnitude is the observed magnitude, which already includes the extinction. So maybe the given m is the observed value. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (i.e., without extinction), and we have to add the extinction to get the observed. So which is it?

The question says, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag... Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Ah, so the note says A_V =3.1 * E(B-V). So if the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic (i.e., without extinction), then the observed would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But in the question, for Star3, it says the apparent V is 15.5. So perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic (because E(B-V) is provided and the note says to calculate A_V). So for Star3, m_intrinsic is 15.5, but the observed would be 15.5 +3.1*(0.6) =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but that would make the observed m=17.36. Which is higher than 17, so not detectable by ESPRESSO. But wait, the given for Star3 says the apparent V is 15.5. So perhaps that's the observed apparent magnitude, already including extinction. So in that case, E(B-V) might not matter for the calculation here, because the given m is already the observed.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

If a star's light passes through interstellar medium, its observed apparent magnitude is dimmer (higher number) than its intrinsic. So, if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, which implies A_V=1.86, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that's not relevant here because the given m is 15.5, which includes the extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, the given m is the apparent magnitude, which already accounts for all extinction. So the E(B-V) is given, but perhaps the user is mistaken in including it. Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the absolute magnitude, and we have to compute the apparent.

Wait, the question says: Star3's "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's absolute magnitude is Mv, but given that it's located at 15 pc, we can compute the apparent magnitude without extinction, then add the extinction.

But Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, which would include any extinction.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem statement says that the question is about apparent V magnitudes. So for any star, if they give the apparent V mag, we can take that as the observed. But wait, for some stars, the given is the absolute magnitude, which we have to compute the apparent, and for others, the apparent is given.

Wait, looking back:

Star1: absolute V magnitude of 15.5 at 10 pc. So we need to compute apparent.

Star2: apparent V of 16.5, so given.

Star3: apparent V of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Hmm, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent, and the E(B-V) is the color excess that causes absorption. But I'm not sure how that works. Because apparent magnitude is observed, so if E(B-V) is present, the observed magnitude should be higher than the intrinsic. So if the star's V magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But the given for Star3 is apparent V of 15.5. So perhaps the 15.5 already includes extinction, meaning that E(B-V) is given but doesn't affect the apparent magnitude here. So, can I proceed by taking Star3's apparent V as 15.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the given 15.5 is the absolute magnitude, but that's not the case because it says apparent magnitude.

Wait, let me re-examine the question.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48 deg, apparent V mag =15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

So the apparent V is given as 15.5. So perhaps the extinction is not affecting the detection condition, because the m is already the observed one. So for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by HIRES (and thus also ESPRESSO). So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if the E(B-V) is 0.6, which gives A_V=1.86, then the star's light is dimmed by extinction. So the apparent V would actually be higher than 15.5; but the given apparent mag is 15.5, which includes extinction. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed value, so we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So acceptable.

Wait, that can't be right because if the star is behind interstellar medium, the apparent magnitude would be higher (dimmer). So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is already including the extinction, then its true brightness is lower.

But perhaps the way the question is set up, the given apparent V is the observed value. So for example, if a star's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then the extinction has already been accounted for in the observed magnitude.

But that's a bit confusing because in reality, E(B-V) is the color excess, which is calculated from the observed B-V minus the intrinsic B-V. So in any case, perhaps the given apparent V for Star3 is 15.5, so the question is, can it be detected by both spectrographs?

So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Wait, but let me check the other stars.

Star4: RA=85 deg, DEC=-48, absolute V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, at 10 pc.

So Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Compute apparent magnitude without extinction.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5 =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5.

Now, since E(B-V)=0.4, A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So apparent V is 16.74.

Now, for detection: ESPRESSO requires m <17, so 16.74 <17: yes. But HIRES requires m <16. 16.74>16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V=16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 pc: log10(5)=~0.69897.

So m =16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5.

5*(0.69897) = ~3.495, so m=16.5 +3.495 -5 =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 ≈15.0.

So apparent V is ~15.0.

No E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m_observed =15.0.

15.0 <16 (HIRES) and <17 (ESPRESSO). So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m =16.5 +5*(log10(5)) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897, so 5*0.69897=3.49485.

m =16.5 +3.49485 -5 = (16.5 -5) +3.49485 =11.5 +3.49485=14.99485 ≈15.0.

So yes, apparent V is 15.0, which is below both 16 and 17, so detectable by both spectrographs.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star3: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, but let's go back to Star3. So Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5. But the question says, for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So in reality, the observed magnitude is 15.5 +1.86=17.36? That would make it not detectable by either, because 17.36 is above ESPRESSO's limit (17 mag). Wait, but no, because the question says that the given apparent magnitude is already the observed value. So I think my initial assumption is correct: the given apparent V is 15.5, which is the observed magnitude, so it's detectable.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The apparent magnitude given is the observed, which includes extinction. So if the question gives the apparent V as 15.5, that's the observed magnitude, so no need to add A_V again. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but let's see the options.

Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES's 16, so only Star5 is acceptable.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both are acceptable.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, above HIRES's limit.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74, above HIRES's limit.

So the correct option would be B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check Star3.

Wait, Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, so its m is 15.5, which is below 16 (HIRES) and 17 (ESPRESSO). So it's acceptable. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Star5 has m=15.0, same reasoning.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B is "Star3 and Star5".

So the answer should be B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have \( m < 16 \) to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \) and \( < 17 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 \), which is \( > 17 \).  
   - **Not detectable by ESPRESSO.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \), which is \( > 16 \).  
   - **Not detectable by HIRES.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 \approx 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \), which is \( < 16 \) and \( < 17 \).  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)).

**Answer: B**
