Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is like 1 solar radius. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? Oh wait no, maybe it's the fraction of the entire star's surface. Hmm, wait the question says one hemisphere is covered, so the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, actually, no, wait. Let me read again. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So, for example, if the filling factor is 100%, the entire hemisphere is spots. So 20% means 20% of the hemisphere is spots, so 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

But wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R². But maybe I should think about the total area in terms of the star's surface. Alternatively, perhaps the total area covered is 20% of the star's surface? Because a hemisphere is half the star, so 20% of that would be 0.1 of the star's surface area. Hmm, wait no, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. So, the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) )= 0.4π R². The total surface area of the star is 4πR², so the fraction of the star covered by spots is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, no. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The entire star is 4πR². So the fraction is 0.4/4 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, right? Because the temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K.

So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of our view, causing brightness variations. Because the spots are cooler, the overall brightness of the star as seen from Earth will dip slightly when a spot is facing us (since it's darker).

Now, the question is: if a planet transited the same star, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait no, the problem says that, given the spots, the photometric observations show brightness variations. But if instead, the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So the idea is to compare the relative brightness change caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star. So delta F = (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux.

But wait, what about the spots? The spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the visible side. Let's model the star as having two regions: the spotted area and the normal area.

When the star isn't rotating, the spots are on the far side, so we see full brightness. As it rotates, the spots come into view, reducing the brightness.

The effective brightness when a fraction of the star is spotted is the sum of the brightness from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4. When a spot is present, its flux is sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4. The fraction of the star that's spotted is f, so the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) + F0 * f * ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4.

So the relative change in flux (delta F / F0) is (1 - f) + f*( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 - 1. Wait, no. The maximum change occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. So the relative dip is [ (1 - f) * (1) + f * ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ] / 1 -1.

Wait, no, the maximum dip occurs when all the spotted areas are facing us. So the brightness becomes (F_unspotted*(1-f) + F_spotted*f) / F_total.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are fully visible.

Let me think in terms of flux. The total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² sigma Teff^4. When the star has spots covering a fraction f of its surface, the flux when the spots are visible is F_spots = F0 * (1 - f) + F0 * f * ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4.

So the fractional change is (F_spots - F0)/F0 = [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 - 1 ].

Which simplifies to -f [ 1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ].

So the fractional dip is delta = f [ 1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ].

Wait, but this is the maximum dip when all the spots are visible. So we calculate this delta and compare it to the dip caused by a planet transit.

The dip caused by a planet is delta_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we set delta = delta_planet.

So:

f [ 1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ] = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need to solve for Rp/Rstar.

Given the parameters:

f = 0.2 (since it's the filling factor of one hemisphere, which is 20% of that hemisphere's area. Wait wait, earlier calculation: the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The total star area is 4π R², so f = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1. So f is 0.1.

Ah, that's an important point. So f = 0.1, not 0.2. Because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is half the star, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Wait, no. Wait the question states: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The total star surface area is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1. So f = 0.1.

So f = 0.1.

delta T is 1000 K. Teff is 6000 K.

So plugging in the numbers:

delta = 0.1 [ 1 - ( (6000 - 1000)/6000 )^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 = 0.6944, then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So delta ≈ 0.05177, which is the fractional change in brightness when the spots are at maximum visibility.

We need to set this equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Take the square root: Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177).

What's sqrt(0.05177)? Let's compute.

0.05177 is approximately 0.0518.

The square root of 0.05 is about 0.2236, and 0.0518 is a bit higher.

Let me compute 0.227^2: 0.227 * 0.227 = approx 0.0515.

0.228^2 = 0.051984. So 0.228 squared is about 0.05198, which is a bit higher than 0.05177.

So sqrt(0.05177) is approximately 0.2275, say 0.227.

Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 0.227^2: 0.227 * 0.227.

Let me compute 227 * 227.

227 * 200 = 45,400.

227 *27 = 6,129.

Total is 51,529. So 227^2 is 51,529. So 0.227^2 is 0.051529.

Wait, 0.227^2 is 0.051529, and 0.2275^2 is ?

0.2275^2 = (0.227 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.227^2 + 2*(0.227)*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

Which is 0.051529 + 0.000227 + 0.00000025 = 0.051756.

Ah, so 0.2275^2 is approximately 0.051756, which is very close to 0.05177.

So sqrt(0.05177) is approximately 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, none of the options match 0.2275. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, what did I do wrong here. Let me double-check.

Ah, wait, let me recalculate the delta. Maybe I messed up the spots' area.

Wait, f is 0.1 as we computed earlier. Then the calculation:

delta = 0.1 [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Ah, (5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

Yes, that part is correct.

So delta is ~0.05177.

The dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake in f.

Wait, maybe I calculated f incorrectly.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², and the spots cover 0.2 of that.

So area_spots = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total area of the star is 4 π R².

So the fraction f is area_spots / area_star = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So f is 0.1. That seems right.

Wait, is there a possibility that I misapplied the filling factor? Because sometimes, filling factor can refer to the fraction of the entire disk. But according to the question, it's 20% of the hemisphere.

Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read again: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So yes, f is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the flux. Let me think about the flux calculation again.

The total flux when the spots are visible is F = F_unspotted * (1 - f) + F_spotted * f.

F_unspotted is sigma * Teff^4 per unit area. But the total flux is integrated over the star's surface.

Wait, for the entire star, the total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

When spots cover area A_spots, the flux is F0 - A_spots * sigma Teff^4 + A_spots * sigma (Teff - delta T)^4.

Which can be written as F0 [ 1 - f * (1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ) ].

So the flux change is F = F0 [1 - f (1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ) ].

Thus, the fractional change is:

(F - F0) / F0 = - f (1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 )

Which is the same as before, so delta = f (1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 )

Wait a second, but when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is maximum, and when they're on the near side, brightness is minimum. So the variation amplitude is delta.

But wait, when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is F0. When they're on the near side, the flux is F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ].

So the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side, so the dip is F0 - [ F0 ( (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ) ].

Which equals F0 [ f (1 - (Teff-delta T / Teff)^4 ) ].

So fractional dip is f [ 1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ].

Which is what I calculated earlier.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but then the dip is 0.05177, which means the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275. But none of the options are close to 0.2275.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but their influence on the light curve depends on how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the brightness variation differently.

Wait, another thought: the spots being on a hemisphere might cause the star's brightness to vary as the star rotates, but the amplitude of the variation depends on the spot coverage and temperature difference.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So the brightness variation from the spots as the star rotates would mimic a planet transiting, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the rotational modulation is such that it's similar to a transit.

Wait, but the question is, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in brightness as the spots do. That is, what planet would cause the same delta F / F0 as the spots.

So the approach we took should be correct, but our calculation gives Rp/Rstar ~ 0.2275, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with the effective temperature considering the spot's area.

Wait, maybe I should model the star's total flux as a combination of unspotted and spotted regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, another approach: when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 * ( (1 - f) * 1 + f * ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 )

The amplitude is (F0 - F) / F0 = (1 - [ (1 - f) + f * ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ]) )

Which is f [ 1 - ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 ]

Which again gives the same delta.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4. Let me compute it again.

5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(0.833333)^4.

Compute step by step:

0.833333^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694444.

Then, 0.694444 squared is (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

Wait, that's correct. So yes, 5/6^4 is 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747.

So delta is about 0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.05177) = approx 0.2275. So about 0.23.

Looking at the options again, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. Let's try that.

If f is 0.2 instead of 0.1, then delta = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

Then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is close to option D, which is ~0.32.

Ah! Now that makes sense. So perhaps I misunderstood the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. But if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface area, then f would be 0.2.

So perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

The question states: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.

So, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The star's total surface area is 4π R².

Thus, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is f = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

But perhaps the question is using the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. That would make f=0.2, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈0.32, which is option D.

So why would that be the case?

Because if the question says "the filling factor of 20%", sometimes filling factor refers to the fraction of the entire star's surface. For example, in stars with spots, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire visible surface during any given time.

Wait, perhaps the question is worded ambiguously. Let me read again: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Hmm, perhaps it's the filling factor of the hemisphere. So, 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So f is 0.1, as before.

But then, the dip would be 0.05177, requiring a planet of Rp/Rstar ~0.2275.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star.

So f=0.2.

Then, delta = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.103549.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.103549) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So option D.

Thus, the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the problem expects f to be 0.2, not 0.1. Maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star covered by spots, not just the hemisphere.

But according to the problem statement, it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, so the spots only cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible effect. When the hemisphere of spots is fully visible, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no, that would again be 0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should model the maximum dip as when the entire 20% of the star's surface is covered. But no, because the spots are on a hemisphere, so the maximum visible is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star is viewed edge-on (so that the entire hemisphere is visible), but that's not the case. No, the star is observed from Earth, which is presumably looking at one hemisphere at a time. So when the star's rotational period brings the hemisphere with spots into view, the maximum dip is when the entire 20% of that hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but if the spots are on a single hemisphere, when the star is viewed face-on (with that hemisphere facing us), the spots are fully visible. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction is 0.4 π / 4 π = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

So I'm back to the original calculation, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the maximum dip but an average dip. Or perhaps the star's rotation is such that only a portion of the spots are visible at any one time, leading to a sinusoidal variation.

But I don't think that's the case because the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet, implying that the maximum dip is similar to a planet transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the amplitude of the brightness variation as a function of rotation period, but that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: when the star is partially spotted, the brightness variation is periodic and could have a certain amplitude. The amplitude of the brightness variation for a planet is a dip when it transits, but for spots, the variation is a sinusoidal-like change as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But the problem states that the photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude of this variation is the same as the amplitude caused by a planet transit.

So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation for the spots is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, but in that case, the dip is the same. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are cooler, so the flux is lower. But in terms of the dip, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should recalculate the (5/6)^4 term.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^2 is approximately 0.694444.

0.694444^2 is approximately 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 is 0.482253.

Then 1 - 0.482253 is 0.517747.

So delta = 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275 or 22.75% of the star's radius.

But options don't include this. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial approach.

Wait, another idea: when the star is observed, only a portion of the spots is visible depending on the rotation. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. But because the spots are on a single hemisphere, the maximum area of spots visible is 20% of that hemisphere, i.e., 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the area of the star (4π R²), so the fraction is 0.4π / 4π = 0.1.

Wait, but in that case, it's same as before. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. Which of these are closest to 0.23? Option D is 0.32, which is higher. Option A is 0.39, higher. Option C is 0.11, lower. Option B is 0.07, lower.

Wait, maybe I did the sqrt wrong. Let me compute sqrt(0.05177) again.

0.05177 is about 0.0518.

Let me compute 0.227^2: 0.227 * 0.227 = 0.051529.

0.2275^2 is 0.051756.

So 0.2275^2=0.051756, which is very close to 0.05177.

So the planet radius ratio is approximately 0.2275.

But none of the options match. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the delta T is not 1000 K below Teff, but a 1000 K higher? No, that can't be because spots are cooler.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me see what the options suggest. If the correct answer is option D (0.32), then delta would be (0.32)^2 = 0.1024.

Which would imply that 0.1 [1 - (5/6)^4 ] = 0.1024.

Wait, 0.1 [1 - (5/6)^4 ] is 0.05177, which is less than 0.1024. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if f were 0.2, then 0.2 * 0.5177 would be 0.1035, which is close to 0.1024.

So perhaps the intended f is 0.2, meaning the spots cover 20% of the entire star.

But according to the problem statement, the spots are on one hemisphere, so f is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotational period brings the entire hemisphere into view, so the maximum spot coverage is 20% of the star's surface, which would make f=0.2.

But that contradicts the earlier logic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as the star having a spot coverage of 20% of its entire surface. Then f=0.2.

So delta=0.2 * 0.517747=0.10355.

Rp/Rstar= sqrt(0.10355)=0.3218, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, considering f=0.2.

Given the options, the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we compare the fractional dip in brightness caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star Radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (solar radius).
- **Filling Factor**: The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. This means 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The area of a hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \). The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( f = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1 \).
- **Temperature Difference**: The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \). The effective temperature of the star is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), so the temperature of the spots is \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The fractional dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible is given by:

\[
\delta = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\delta = 0.1 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
\]

First, calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
\[
\frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
\]
\[
\left( 0.8333 \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]

Thus:
\[
\delta = 0.1 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.1 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.05177
\]

This is the fractional dip in brightness caused by the spots.

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
The fractional dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
\[
\delta_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To produce the same amplitude in brightness variation, we set \( \delta_{\text{planet}} = \delta \):
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275
\]

### Issue with the Options:
The calculated value of \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if we reinterpret the filling factor as 20% of the entire star's surface (instead of 20% of the hemisphere), the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots becomes \( f = 0.2 \). Recalculating:

\[
\delta = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.10355
\]

Then:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.32 \), which matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the filling factor refers to 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
