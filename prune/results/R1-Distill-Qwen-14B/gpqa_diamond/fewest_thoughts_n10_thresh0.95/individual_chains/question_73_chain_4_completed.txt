Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to work through this. 

So, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and match them to the options.

First, let's parse the problem. We've got two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, both moving in the same direction, each at their own speed.

Wait, but when dealing with relative velocity in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is:

v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Where u is the speed of one object relative to another, and v and u are their speeds in the same inertial frame. Wait, no, actually, when you're finding the speed of one object from the perspective of the other, you use this formula. Here, one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, what's the relative speed of the other astronaut?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "relative speed" of the two astronauts. So, if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but we have to calculate it using the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B? Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be v - u? No, wait, because in A's frame, B is moving slower. So the relative speed is (v - u) divided by (1 - (u*v)/(c²))? Wait, no, I think the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c^2)).

Wait, no, the velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities between frames. So, if in the lab frame, A is moving at u, and B is moving at v, then the speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So yes, that's right.

So, let's plug in the numbers. u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So,

v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, sorry, it's (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So, v is 0.5c, u is 0.6c.

Wait wait no, u is the velocity of the frame we're moving to. Oh, right, when finding the velocity of B as observed from A's frame, it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of A in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of B in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The velocity addition formula is for when you have two frames, S and S', where S' is moving at velocity u with respect to S. So, if the velocity of object B in S is v, then in S', it would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So, in this case, the lab frame is S, and astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c. So, from A's frame (S'), what is the speed of B, which is moving at v = 0.5c in S.

So, substituting:

v' = (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So:

v' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c-0.6c= -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 -0.3=0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so the magnitude is 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That's one value we need.

Now, looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, and option D the same. So that's a start.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, so relativistic energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the problem states "total energy of the system." So I think it's the sum of the energies of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c². So, for each, we calculate their gamma and multiply by their rest mass energy.

Wait, but the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So for each astronaut, their energy is gamma * (their mass) * c².

So let's calculate each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36c²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So her energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25 c²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but the options don't have 5.96. Let me check the options again.

Option C: E=5.96 mc².

Option B: E=4.96 mc².

Option D: E=5 mc².

So, the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So putting it together, relative speed is 0.14c and total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That's our answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Did I get the sign right? Because u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c, so v - u is negative, which means the astronaut B is moving slower than A in the lab frame. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward? No, wait, both are moving in the same direction. So if A is moving faster than B, then from A's frame, B is moving backward? Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So in A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab, what is B's speed?

Wait, in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c, B's speed would be (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c² ) ) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.14c, which means B is moving at 0.14c in the opposite direction relative to A. But relative speed is the magnitude, so it's 0.14c.

Yes, that's correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). The relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} \) is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \)
- Total energy: \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \)

These match the values in **Option C**.
