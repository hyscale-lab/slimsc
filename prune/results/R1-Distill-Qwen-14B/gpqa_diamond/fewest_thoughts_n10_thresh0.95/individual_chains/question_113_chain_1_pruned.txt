Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen atoms.

First, let's go through each piece of data one by one and see what information they provide.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness is often because of hydrogen bonding, which is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak could also indicate an alcohol, like an -OH group. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group, but maybe conjugated or something else. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring or an amine? Wait, no, amine peaks are usually around 1600. Wait, no, that's for C-N stretching. Aromatic rings have peaks around 1450-1600 due to C=C stretching. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C (vinyl) stretch. Wait, but then I thought the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which would match a C=C group. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester, perhaps.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum: there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a C=C, so that means the compound has an alkene group. So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and an alkene. That's important.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what gives a mass of 45? Let me think. 45 could be a fragment with, for example, (CH3)2O (if it's an ether), but wait, that's more like 45 (since (CH3)2O is 15 + 16 + 16? Wait, wait: carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So (CH3)2O is (12*2) + 6 + 16 = 24 + 6 +16=46. Oh, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a ketene group or something. Or perhaps it's a CH3CO+ fragment, like a CH3CO group. Let's see: CH3CO has a molecular weight of 12*2 + 3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Not 45. Wait, what's 45? Let's think of possible fragments. Maybe a CH2O group? That's 12 + 2 + 16 = 30. Hmm. Or maybe a C3O group? That's 36 +16=52. Hmm. Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight when the formula is C2H5O. Let me see, C2H5O has 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. So the fragment could be C2H5O, which could be an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), but that's more of a larger fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CH2O+ ion, but that would be 45? Wait, CH2O is 30, CH3O is 31, CH2CH2O? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Now, the options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

We need to find which formula fits all the data.

Let's think about the possible functional groups. The FTIR shows an O-H (broad peak) and a carbonyl group (1700 and 1650). So possible functional groups could be an alcohol and a ketone, or maybe an ester and something else. Wait, but if there are two carbonyl peaks, that could suggest two different carbonyl groups, or perhaps one is from another source. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring (but 1650 could be an aromatic ring). Hmm.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in IR, the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps a conjugated system. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, possibly conjugated.

Looking at the possible formulas, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. If there are no halogens or nitrogen here, then DoU = (2C + 2 - H - O*2)/2? Wait, no, wait. The formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But O doesn't directly affect it unless it's in a double bond or ring.

Wait, more accurately, each O in a hydroxyl or carbonyl doesn't add to the degree of unsaturation, because it's part of a single bond. Only double bonds or rings count.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all the options have O but no X or N, we can adjust.

For example, for option A: C6H12O2.

DoU is (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 2/2=1. So 1 DoU. That would mean one double bond or one ring. But wait, if the compound has both a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that would be two DoU. But the formula for A would only allow one. So that can't be.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the O is involved in an ester or something else.

Wait, let me compute DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one DoU. That would be either one ring or one double bond or combination.

But our compound has both a carbonyl group (C=O is a double bond) and a vinyl group (C=C, another double bond). So that's two DoU. So the formula must have at least two DoU.

Let me check all the options.

Option A: DoU=1. So can't have two double bonds. So probably not A.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoU. So that's possible if there are two double bonds or one double bond and a ring. Or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So also two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. So again, one DoU. So can't have two double bonds.

So options B and C have DoU of 2. So they could have two double bonds, which is what we have (C=O and C=C).

So now, the possible options are B and C.

But let's see the other data.

The mass spectrum has a peak at m/z=45. So, the molecular ion might lose some fragment, but the most intense peak is at 45. So what could that be?

Alternatively, that could be the molecular formula's molecular ion, but 45 is a much smaller number. Let's think about each option's molecular weight.

Wait, for each option:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is 6*12 +12*1 + 2*16=72 +12 +32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100. The question says the MS shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. So the molecular ion is likely higher than 45, so 45 is a fragment.

45 could be a fragment with molecular weight 45. Let me think of possible fragments.

In option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight 98. If the molecule breaks into something with 45, perhaps. Alternatively, for option C, molecular weight 114. Breaking into 45 and 69, which is possible.

But how can we get a fragment of 45? Let's think of possible functional groups. For example, an ester group, maybe.

Wait, another approach: in Mass Spec, a common fragment is the tropylium ion (m/z=91 for benzene rings), but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, for ketones, the methyl group may cleave off. Alternatively, for esters, the ester group can break into the acid and alcohol parts.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion (since CH3CO is 43?), but wait, 45 is 2 more. Maybe that's a CH3CO-O- or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH3COO group. Wait, CH3COO is (12*2 + 3 + 16*2)=24+3+32=59. That's higher than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with some oxygen. CH2CH2O would be 45? Let me calculate: C2H5O is 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh, right! So the fragment could be C2H5O, which is an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So that would have a molecular weight of 45. So if the molecule has an ethoxy group, maybe the mass spec shows that.

Looking back at the options, which formulas include an ethoxy group?

Well, the formula C6H10O2 would have two oxygen atoms. If it's an ester, the formula would be R-O-CO-R', for example. So the ester group would have two oxygen atoms. So option C is C6H10O2, which could fit an ester structure, which may fragment into ethoxy (45) and another part.

Alternatively, the 45 could be a CH3CO+ fragment. Let's see, CH3CO is 12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Hmm, not 45. So maybe it's a different fragment.

Wait, another possibility: the molecular formula is C6H10O, which is option B. Let's see if that can produce a fragment of 45. The molecular weight is 98. If the molecule loses a fragment of 53 (98-45=53), that might not be as common. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's compute:

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114. So 114 - m/z=45 would give 69. What's 69? Let me think. 69 could be something like a benzene ring fragment? No, benzene is 78. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclopropane ring? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with C3H7O, which is 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. No, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropenyl group or something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, but in this case, the compound is the larger one. So maybe the parent ion breaks into two parts: one of 45 and the other of (e.g., for option C: 114-45=69). What's 69? Let's think: 69 could be C5H11O perhaps? Or maybe a cyclohexenyl group or something. Not sure. Alternatively, 69 could be C3H7NO, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is the result of a McLafferty rearrangement or another type of cleavage.

Wait, another approach: the presence of O in the formula. Let's consider the possible structures.

If the FTIR shows O-H, that suggests an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the broad peak is more typical of an alcohol, like -OH.

Wait, but if the compound has both O-H and a carbonyl group, that could be a ketone and an alcohol, but that's less likely because of possible hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, it could be an ester and an alcohol? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha-hydroxy ketone or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

But let's think about the possible structures.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygens. That could be an ester: R-O-CO-R'. Esters have a carbonyl (around 1700 cm^-1) and an ether group. But in the IR, there's a broad O-H peak, which an ester doesn't have. So maybe it's not an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the O-H would be even broader, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. But a carboxylic acid would have a very strong O-H around 2500-3300, which is a broad peak. Hmm, but the question says a very broad peak at 3000. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be much higher, like around 2500-3300, which is a very broad stretch. However, the question says the broad peak is at 3000, which is more typical for an alcohol. So maybe it's an alcohol and a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. That would have both a carbonyl and an alcohol group. Let's see.

In that case, the IR would show a broad O-H around 3200-3600 (but the question says 3000, which is a bit lower, but perhaps it's a secondary alcohol). The carbonyl would be around 1700.

But then, how many DoU would that require? Let's see: beta-keto alcohol would have a structure like CH3-C(OH)-CH2-CO-R. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-R. So that would have a double bond (C=C), an alcohol (O-H), and a ketone (C=O). So that would have two double bonds (C=C and C=O), so DoU would be two, which fits options B and C.

But let's think about the options again.

Option B is C6H10O: molecular formula would be 6 carbons, 10 H, 1 O.

If it's a structure with both a double bond and an O-H group, that would fit.

Option C is C6H10O2: 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O.

So, structure possibilities for each:

Option B: a cyclic ether with a double bond and an O-H group? Hmm, but how would that work. Alternatively, maybe a diol with a double bond. Or an allyl alcohol with a ring.

Option C: perhaps an ester with another oxygen group, but that would require two oxygens. Alternatively, a glycol ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diethyl acetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the 1H NMR. It has vinyl hydrogens, meaning there's a C=C in the molecule. The presence of these protons suggests that the double bond is not part of a conjugated system that would deshield them too much or cause them to be absent (like in a diene or aromatic ring where they might be more downfield). Also, the vinyl protons are probably in a trans or cis configuration, but that's more about splitting than anything else.

Wait, but if the molecule has an ester group, the ester carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. But then, where's the O-H? Maybe it's an alcohol as well. But if it's an ester and an alcohol, that would be a glycol ester? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a β-keto ester. Wait, but that would have two carbonyl groups. The IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the molecule has a conjugated diene or a substituted alkene.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible structures for each option.

Option B: C6H10O. The molecular formula is similar to that of cyclohexanol (C6H11OH). Wait, cyclohexanol is C6H12O. So option B has two less hydrogens. So perhaps cyclohexene with an alcohol group? Let's see: cyclohexenol. So for example, cyclohex-2
