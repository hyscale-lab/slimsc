Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The options are A to D with different percentages.

First, let me understand what's given. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, stability constants. Right, β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, β is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the metal ion and the ligand raised to the appropriate powers. Hmm.

Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate. I remember that these complexes can have different numbers of SCN- ligands attached. So for Co(II), the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} perhaps? Because each SCN- is a -1 charge, so adding them around Co^2+ would change the overall charge.

Wait, let's think about the complexes. Co^2+ with SCN^- will form [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ -n}? Or wait, how does the charge work? Each SCN^- is -1. So, the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} would have a charge of 2+ minus n*(-1). Because Co is +2, each SCN is -1, so the overall charge is 2 - n*(1) = 2 - n.

Wait, no, because each SCN contributes a -1. So the complex charge is Co^2+ plus n*(-1). So 2+ - n*1. So, for n=1, it's +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So these are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but in the question, the blue dithiocyanato complex is mentioned. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is the one we're interested in. So the question is about the percentage of this complex in the solution.

To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), I need to calculate the fraction of Co^2+ that is complexed as [Co(SCN)_2]^0, relative to all possible cobalt species.

So the approach would be to consider all the possible species and their concentrations, and find out which fraction comes from the n=2 complex.

The general approach for these problems is to use the logarithmic expressions for each β and calculate the distribution of species based on their stability.

Wait, but another approach is to use the formation of complexes step-wise. Let me think. Each complex is formed from the previous one by adding another SCN-.

But perhaps a better way is to consider the fraction of each complex. The fraction of each complex depends on the product of the respective β's and the ligand concentration raised to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible complexes.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (Σ (β_k [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4)

Wait, but wait. For each complex [Co(SCN)_n], the formation constant (β_n) is for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

But β_n is the formation constant for that specific complex. So the fraction f_n of each complex is given by (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum of (β_k [SCN]^k) for k from 0 to 4).

Wait, but wait. Or is it that the overall distribution depends on the step-wise formation constants? Let me clarify.

Alternatively, the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But considering that, it's tricky to handle all four complexes. Another approach is to calculate the conditional formation constant, which considers the ligand concentration.

Wait, but perhaps I can model the distribution using the following idea:

The fraction of each complex is proportional to β_n [SCN]^n. So the numerator for each term is β_n [SCN]^n, and the denominator is the sum of all such terms for n=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the β's are given for each complex, so for [Co(SCN)_n], β_n is the overall formation constant for that complex.

So for n=0, it's just Co^2+ → [Co(SCN)_0] = Co^2+. So β_0 is 1, perhaps? Or maybe the problem starts with β_1 for the first complex.

Wait, looking at the data, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think that the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4). So each β represents the formation of the complex with that n.

So for each n, the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all k of (β_k [SCN]^k).

Wait, but in that case, n can be 1,2,3,4. So for each complex, the fraction is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum of β_k [SCN]^k from k=1 to 4).

Wait, but wait, the uncomplexed Co^2+ is also a species. So the denominator should include the term for n=0. But what's β_0? Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+. So the β_0 would be 1, since [Co^2+] is the base case.

So the total denominator is sum from n=0 to 4 of (β_n [SCN]^n).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formation constants are given for each complex. For [Co(SCN)_n], the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}

So for each complex, the concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But since the total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)_1] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = 1e-2 M.

Alternatively, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+] / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think. Let me denote [Co] as the total concentration, which includes all the species.

So [Co] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)_1] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4}.

And each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So substituting, [Co] = [Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+] [S]^1 + β_2 [Co^2+] [S]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+] [S]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+] [S]^4.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co] = [Co^2+] ( 1 + β_1 [S]^1 + β_2 [S]^2 + β_3 [S]^3 + β_4 [S]^4 )

So [Co^2+] = [Co] / ( 1 + β_1 [S] + β_2 [S]^2 + β_3 [S]^3 + β_4 [S]^4 )

Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co] = (β_n [S]^n [Co^2+]) / [Co]

Substituting [Co^2+] from above:

= (β_n [S]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [S] + β_2 [S]^2 + β_3 [S]^3 + β_4 [S]^4 )

So, f_n = (β_n [S]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [S]^k )

But wait, when n=0, β_0 is 1, and [S]^0 is 1, so the first term in the denominator is 1.

Wait, but wait, in our case, β_0 is 1, so the denominator becomes 1 + β_1 [S] + β_2 [S]^2 + β_3 [S]^3 + β_4 [S]^4.

So for each n, f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / denominator.

So the goal is to compute f_2, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
- [S] = 0.1 M (thiocyanate concentration)
- β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, compute the denominator:

Denominator D = 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4

Let me compute each term:

Compute each term step by step.

Term for n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [S] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: β2 [S]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3: β3 [S]^3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

n=4: β4 [S]^4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So adding all terms:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute step by step.

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So D ≈ 2.3646.

Then, the fraction f_2 is (β2 [S]^2 ) / D.

Which is (40 * 0.01 ) / 2.3646 = (0.4 ) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's compute that.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 

Well, 2.3646 × 0.169 = approximately 0.4? Let me compute 2.3646 × 0.169.

2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 

2 * 0.169 = 0.338.

0.3646 *0.169 ≈ approx 0.3646 *0.17= ~0.062.

Total ≈ 0.338 + 0.062 = 0.4. So 0.169.

So f_2 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9% approximately.

Wait, but the options include D) 16.9%, which seems to match. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646 accurately.

2.3646 ≈ 2.3646.

0.4 / 2.3646 = ?

Let me compute 2.3646 × 0.169 = ?

0.169 * 2 = 0.338

0.169 * 0.3646 = Let me compute 0.169 * 0.3 = 0.0507, 0.169 *0.06=0.01014, 0.169*0.0046=0.0007774. Summing these: 0.0507+0.01014=0.06084 +0.0007774=0.0616174.

So total 0.338 + 0.0616174= 0.3996174 ≈ 0.4.

So yes, 0.169, so 16.9% which is option D. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes.

Wait, but in the denominator, I included n=0 to n=4. But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So in our calculation, n starts from 0 (uncomplexed Co^2+) and goes up to 4. So the calculation for f_2 is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The question states "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species". So dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the n=2 complex. So the calculation is correct.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 42.3%
B) 25.6%
C) 38.1%
D) 16.9%

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the answer is D) 16.9%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I thought about β values, sometimes higher β indicates more stability. Here, β2 is 40, which is the second highest after β3=63. But in our calculation, the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) has about 16%—which is the same as option D.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should recalculate the denominator.

Wait, [S] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term again:

n=0: 1

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: 40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646. So yes, denominator is 2.3646.

f_2 is (40 *0.01)/2.3646 = 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9%.

Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

But wait, another thought: Do the β's represent the cumulative formation constant or the step-wise? Because sometimes, formation constants can be step-wise (each step adds one ligand), but the overall β is the product of step-wise constants.

Wait, in the problem statement, the β's are given as the stability constants of the complexes. So I think that β_n is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands.

So in that case, our approach is correct.

Thus, the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex, fₙ, is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, β₀ = 1 (for the uncomplexed Co²⁺), and the denominator is the sum of all terms for n = 0 to 4. The goal is to compute f₂, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Adding these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute f₂
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
