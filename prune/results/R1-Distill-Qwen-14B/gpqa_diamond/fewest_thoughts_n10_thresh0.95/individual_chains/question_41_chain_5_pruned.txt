Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of the light is relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, we might need to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Wait, but does that apply here? Because the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass, which has a refractive index n.

Wait, light in a medium usually has a speed of c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed would be v_light = c/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass itself is moving relative to the lab frame. Oh, right, so the observer in the lab is moving relative to the glass's frame.

So, the problem is about transforming velocities between frames. The glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at speed c/n within the glass. But wait, from the lab frame, how does that look?

Wait, I think the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So, the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n, but in the lab frame, we have to add the glass's velocity to that, right? But wait, that's only if the velocities are non-relativistic. Oh, but wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like that. You have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? But wait, that's in a vacuum. What happens when light is in a medium? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at c/n in the glass, then from the lab frame, the speed of the light would be v_light = (c/n + v) / (1 + (v c)/(n c²)) ? No, wait, the velocity addition formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame (glass's frame). But since the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, the lab frame would see the light's velocity as u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c²).

Wait, but I'm getting into a tangle here. Let me think again. The speed of light in the glass (from the glass's frame) is u' = c/n. So using the velocity addition formula, the speed in the lab frame is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Substituting u' = c/n, we get u = (c/(n) + v) / (1 + (c v)/(n c^2)).

Simplifying the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that:

Denominator after substitution: 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/(n)) * v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c).

So, the denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting numerator and denominator together:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v).

Wait, but (n c + v) is the same as (c n + v) which is same as (c + n v) if we factor differently? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (n c + v) is the same as (n c + v), and (c + n v) is c(1) + n v. Hmm, not quite the
