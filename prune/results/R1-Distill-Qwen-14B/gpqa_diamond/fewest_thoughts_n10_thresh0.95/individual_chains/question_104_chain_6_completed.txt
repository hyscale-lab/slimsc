Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right? Or wait, maybe it's more about the planet's mass and the star's mass. Oh right, the star's mass plays a role in how much it moves.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. So, same mass for both planets, same star masses. The RV method is used, so they measure the Doppler shift of the spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's orbit. So, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is the parameter here.

I remember that the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) * ( sin i ), where e is eccentricity and i is the inclination angle.

But wait, since the planets' orbits are circular (e=0), the term (1 - e²)^0.5 becomes 1. Also, the problem states both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are solar mass. So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So M_planet is negligible compared to the star. That simplifies things.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (P )^(-1/3) ) ) * ( sin i )

Wait, but wait. Let me get the exact formula right. I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ] * [ (P/(2π) )^(-1/3) ) ] * sin i

But again, since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so we can write:

K ≈ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * [ ( P/(2π) )^(-1/3) ) ] * sin i

But wait, let me think again. Wait, the formula for K is derived from the orbit. The star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because velocity is related to the size of the orbit and the period.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. Alternatively, I can recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * ( (G/(4π²))^(1/3) ) * (1/(a^(1/3))) ), but maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, since both planets have the same mass and the same star mass, perhaps the ratio of their velocities depends on the inverse cube root of the orbital periods.

Wait, the question gives us the velocities as the shifts: 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, no. The Doppler shift translates into velocity via the relation:

Δλ / λ = v / c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity amplitude K is proportional to Δλ.

Wait, yes, exactly. The Doppler shift (change in wavelength) is proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 has a shift of 5 ma and planet #2 has 7 ma, then their K velocities are in the ratio 5:7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7. So K1 = (5/7) K2.

But since the stars are the same mass and the planets are same mass, then K is proportional to (M_p / M_s) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ), because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, let me think more clearly. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Since e=0 for both, that term is 1. Also, assuming the inclination i is the same for both (like edge-on for both, which gives sin i=1). So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const.

Similarly, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3).

But wait, no. Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = K * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = K * (1/P2^(1/3)). So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3).

But we know K1/K2 = 5/7. So 5/7 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

We can rearrange this to find (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it step by step.

K1 = (some constant) / P1^(1/3)

K2 = same constant / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = [1/P1^(1/3)] / [1/P2^(1/3)] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

I need to find how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the question is P2 / P1 = ?

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Calculating (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is it? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, no, because 0.36 is less than one. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's about 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter, not longer.

But that's not matching the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Wait, 0.36 is option A. So the answer would be that P2 is approximately 0.36 times the period of P1. So planet #2 has a shorter period. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times, which is shorter. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't get the ratio reversed.

Because K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So earlier, we said K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 * P1 → meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, which is shorter. So the answer is 0.36, so option A.

But wait, the question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" If P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's shorter by a factor of ~2.75 (since 1/0.36 ≈ 2.778). But the question is asking how many times longer, so the answer would be 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

So the answer is A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't get the ratio wrong. Another approach: if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, because P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P1 = (1/K1^3) * const, P2 = (1/K2^3)*const.

So P1/P2= (K2^3)/(K1^3) = (7/5)^3.

So (7/5)^3 is 343/125 ≈ 2.744. So P1 is about 2.744 times P2.

Which means P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So again, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, not longer. So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that the Doppler shifts caused by the planets are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The relationship between the Doppler shift (K) and the orbital period (P) is derived from the radial velocity method.

The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P), assuming the same stellar and planetary masses for both systems. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From the given data, the ratio of the Doppler shifts is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods is related to the ratio of the Doppler shifts as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times**, meaning planet #2 has a shorter orbital period.

The correct option is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
