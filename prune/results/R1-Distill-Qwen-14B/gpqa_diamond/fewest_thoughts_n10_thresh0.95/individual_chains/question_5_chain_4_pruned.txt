Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provide the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each.

Hmm, so first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured. The operator P here seems to be a vector operator, so I think it's related to angular momentum. Wait, but the operator components are given as P_x, P_y, P_z, each scaled by ħ/2. Oh, wait, these look familiar. Specifically, the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are each 2x2, and for spin-1/2 systems, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So here, P must be similar to the spin operator but perhaps scaled? Or wait, maybe P is the spin operator itself. Because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is ħ/2 times their respective Pauli matrices.

So, the operator vector P is (P_x, P_y, P_z), each component being (ħ/2) * Pauli matrix. So the entire operator vector would be something like P = (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z).

The problem asks for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), perhaps with n_x and n_z being direction cosines. Since it's a direction, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The operator for the component of P along n would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but wait. P is a vector operator, so the component along n would be the dot product: P·n. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (±ħ/2) |ψ>. Since the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, the eigenvector corresponds to the + state along direction n.

So the task is to find the eigenvector of the operator P·n with eigenvalue ħ/2.

But how to construct the matrix for P·n? Let me think. Each component of P is (ħ/2) σ_i. So P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, but σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Let me write out these matrices:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P·n would be (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ].

Wait, let me compute it. So:

n_x σ_x = n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z = n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]
Adding these together, you get:
[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

The eigenvalue equation is [P·n] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>
Wait no, wait. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is:

[ P·n ] |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So to find the eigenvector, maybe it's easier to consider the operator (P·n) divided by ħ/2. Because then the eigenvalue equation becomes:

( (P·n) / (ħ/2) ) |v> = +1 |v>

So the operator becomes (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Because (P·n)/(ħ/2) is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the eigenvalue problem is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] 
|v> = (+1) |v>

Wait, because the equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |v> = |v> 

So, let's write the matrix equation:

n_z v1 + n_x v2 = v1
n_x v1 - n_z v2 = v2

So, arranging equations:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
Equation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

( (n_z -1)   n_x        ) [v1]   = 0
( n_x        (-n_z -1) ) [v2]

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero.

So determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 =0.

Compute that:

(n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2 = 0
n_z^2 - n_x^2 -1 =0.

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So substitution:

n_z^2 - (1 - n_z^2) -1 =0.

Wait, because n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

n_z^2 - (1 - n_z^2) -1 = n_z^2 -1 +n_z^2 -1 = 2n_z^2 -2 =0 → 2n_z^2=2 → n_z^2=1 → n_z = ±1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so n_z can't necessarily be ±1 unless it's along the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me double-check.

The determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Multiply out:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) = (-n_z^2 +1 )

So determinant is (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = (1 -n_z^2) -n_x^2.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, 1 - n_z^2 =n_x^2. So substituting, determinant is n_x^2 - n_x^2 =0. So the determinant is zero, which is correct because the system has non-trivial solutions.

So, the equations are consistent. Now, let's pick one equation to find the relationship between v1 and v2.

Take equation 1: (n_z -1) v1 +n_x v2 =0 → v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] v2.

Hmm, but this seems a bit tricky because n_z and n_x are direction cosines.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write it in terms of an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So, n_x = sinθ cosφ (but since it's in x-z plane, phi is 0 or π, but let's just say φ=0 for simplicity, since the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z plane. Wait no, actually, phi is the angle around the y-axis, so in x-z plane, phi can be 0 or π, but perhaps for the eigenvector, it doesn't matter. Alternatively, perhaps n is given as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

Then equation 1 becomes (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 =0.

So, v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2.

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

v1 = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

The negatives cancel, and 2's cancel. So:

= [ sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2)

So, v1 = cot(θ/2) v2.

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the ratio v1/v2.

Let me denote the ratio r = v1/v2.

Then equation 1: (cosθ -1) r + sinθ = 0.

So,

r = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Which can be written as:

r = sinθ / (1 - cosθ )

Because (cosθ -1 )= -(1 - cosθ ), so the negative in the denominator flips the sign.

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

r = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

Simplify:

r = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

Which is cot(theta/2), so r = cot(theta/2).

Thus, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So, the eigenvector can be written in terms of v2. Let me set v2 = 1 for simplicity, then v1 = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, so let's write the vector as:

|v> = [ v1, v2 ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. The norm squared is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2.

So,

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2), giving:

|v> = [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

Simplify cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so multiplying by sin(theta/2) gives cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this result.

But wait, the options are:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So that's the answer. But let me check other options.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). Hmm, but our solution is in terms of theta/2 and no phase factor, so that's not matching.

Option D has sqrt terms and theta/2. So it's more complicated than our solution, which is just theta/2.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.

Wait, the direction vector n is in x-z plane. So the angle theta is in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Yes, that seems correct. Because the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait. The operator in question is P·n. The eigenstate should be along the direction n, which for spin-1/2, the eigenstates are |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>, but wait, in the x-z plane, phi would be zero or pi, but in our case, phi is zero since the direction is in the x-z plane, so the state would be real.

Wait, no, phi is the angle around the y-axis, but in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state would be:

|+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>

Which in terms of the basis states could be written as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T? Wait, depends on the basis.

Wait, the basis for spin in the z direction is |+z> = [1; 0], |−z> = [0;1]. So the state |+n> would be cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|−z>, which is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So that's exactly what we have.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The task is to determine the eigenvector of the component of $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$, denoted as $P \cdot \vec{n}$, which is expressed as:

\[
P \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
(P \cdot \vec{n}) |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the operator
The Pauli matrices are:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Thus, the operator $P \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
\[
P \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for eigenvector
From the first equation, we find:
\[
v_1 = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1} v_2.
\]
Using the parameterization of $\vec{n}$ in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ (measured from the z-axis), where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the ratio $v_1/v_2$ becomes:
\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\sqrt{\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = 1,
\]
so the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
