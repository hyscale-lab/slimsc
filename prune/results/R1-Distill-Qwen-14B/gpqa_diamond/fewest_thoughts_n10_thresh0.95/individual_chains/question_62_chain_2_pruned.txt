--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, there's a substituent at the 1-position (which is the same as the position where the formyl is, maybe?), which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, the cyclohexyl is connected through a CH2OH group? So, the substituent is like a CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, the entire structure is a cyclohexane with a CHO group and another substituent which is a CH2OH connected to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So, it's similar to benzene rings but in a cyclohexane structure. So, the starting material is CH2CH2 (ethynyl) attached to cyclohexane.

The target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, I need to figure out the steps that would introduce these groups.

Let me look at the options provided and see what each reagent does.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of reagents. Let's examine each option's steps.

Option A: 
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O
Wait, same step 3 and 4? That might be a typo. Let me check the other options.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/ liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what each step does. Let's start with the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. It's a cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group).

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps we're adding substituents. Let me think about how to add these groups.

First, ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various additions. One possibility is hydroboration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would have a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the triple bond will be converted into a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: sometimes when you have a triple bond, you can do something like a 1,2-addition or a 1,4-addition, but more importantly, perhaps the triple bond can be functionalized into a carbonyl group through oxidation or other methods.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond can be used in a coupling reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. It's a terminal alkyne attached to a cyclohexane. So, maybe first we can perform a hydration of the triple bond to get a ketone. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Wait, no, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no: the ethynyl group is a -C≡CH group. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent.

So, to get to the target molecule, which has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl attached to cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, and another group is added as a hydroxymethyl.

Wait, or maybe the ethynyl group is used to introduce both substituents through a series of steps.

Let me think about the possible reactions the ethynyl group can undergo.

Step 1 in all options starts with NaNH2 and some chloride. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. Maybe it's used to deprotonate the alkyne, making it more reactive.

Wait, NaNH2 in methyl chloride: that's a typical method for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps alkyne alkylation? Wait, no, methyl chloride with a strong base like NaNH2 would probably result in the formation of a methyl anion. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so when it's in a solution with a compound with acidic protons, it abstracts them. For example, in the presence of an alkyne, NaNH2 can deprotonate it, generating a strong base like the alkyne anion.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne, so maybe the first step is to deprotonate it. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. The terminal alkyne proton is acidic, so NaNH2 would deprotonate it, giving cyclohexenide with a -C≡C- anion.

Wait, but methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in the presence of NaNH2—could that be an alkylation step? For example, perhaps the alkyne anion attacks the methyl chloride, leading to alkylation. So, the alkyne would add a methyl group. So, after step 1, we would have a di-substituted alkyne? Let me think: if the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and we add a methyl to the triple bond, perhaps it becomes a propargyl group.

Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the anion: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- . Then, adding methyl chloride would provide CH3+. The alkyne anion would attack CH3Cl, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2^- , but wait, that doesn't make sense because ethynyl is already a triple bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is not alkylation but elimination. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Could it cause elimination? For example, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and we treat with NaNH2, perhaps it deprotonates and leads to a triple bond with a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first step is to convert the ethynyl group into a methylene group. Wait, how? I think that NaNH2 with ethyl chloride would alkylate the alkyne, making it longer. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to introduce a substituent adjacent to the triple bond. For example, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride could lead to an alkylation of the alkyne anion, forming a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate a compound, making it a better nucleophile. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, the alkyne's proton is removed by NaNH2, and the resulting anion would attack methyl chloride, adding a methyl group. That would convert the ethynyl group (C≡CH) into CH2-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's not possible because the alkyne is terminal. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is in the middle of the chain. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a CH2-C≡CH group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the alkyne is at the end. So, deprotonating it would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^-.

Then, in the presence of methyl chloride (CH3Cl), the methyl group would add to the alkyne anion. But wait, how? The alkyne anion is a strong base. CH3Cl is a methylating agent. So the anion would attack the methyl chloride, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that doesn't seem right because the chloride would be a leaving group. Or perhaps the alkyne anion would take the methyl as a substituent, giving a longer alkyne. Wait, maybe it's an alkyne alkylation, making it a propargyl chloride? I'm not entirely confident here.

Alternatively, perhaps this step is a Birch reduction, but I don't think so because Birch typically uses metals like Na in NH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to perform a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each reagent in the options.

Looking at Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, methanol would perhaps be a methylating agent, but isn't NaNH2 a strong base? Maybe it's deprotonating something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is for elimination. For example, if we have ethynylcyclohexane, and we deprotonate and eliminate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall synthesis. The target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, and another group is added as a hydroxymethyl.

How can an ethynyl group become a formyl group? One way is through oxidation. For example, an alkyne can be oxidized to a ketone. Wait, but oxidation of a terminal alkyne usually gives a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. Unless it's a di- or tri-substituted alkyne. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process: first, the alkyne is converted to a ketone, then the ketone is transformed into a formyl group.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group through a hydroboration or other addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl. Hmmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH). So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group, and a new hydroxymethyl group is added.

So, first, get the formyl group from the ethynyl. Then, add the hydroxymethyl.

But how? Let's think about each step.

The first step in all options (except D) uses NaNH2 with some chlorides. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination. So, perhaps the first step is an elimination reaction. Wait, what's the structure of ethynylcyclohexane? It's a cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. If the first reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation, making the alkyne more reactive. Then, maybe the next step is hydrogenation. For example, after deprotonation, the alkyne could be hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. But looking at the options, some have H2/Pd as step 2.

Wait, let's think about Option C's step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That sounds like a hydrogenation catalyst, so it's used to reduce triple bonds to single bonds, possibly with some stereochemistry.

Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond can produce either an alkene or an alkane, depending on the conditions. For example, using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline and BaSO4) would give cis addition. Using Na and NH3 (liquid) would give trans (but that's for alkynes to cis alkenes? Wait, no, Na in NH3 is usually for Birch reductions or dehydrohalogenation).

Alternatively, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically reduce it to a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the triple bond CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I think I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group. So, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond. So, using H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? That would make it a butyl group, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, so upon hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because hydrogenation of a triple bond (sp-hybridized carbon) to a single bond would change the structure.

Wait, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2 with two H2 molecules added. So, the triple bond (CH2-C≡CH) becomes CH2-CH2-CH3? So, the cyclohexane would have a propyl group attached: CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's an ethyl group, I think. Wait, perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but the target molecule has a formyl group. So, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. How? Let's think about oxidation. For a terminal alkyne, oxidation with certain reagents can yield a carboxylic acid. For example, using O3 (ozone) followed by H2O2 and then workup can break the triple bond into carbonyl groups. Alternatively, using mercuric sulfate in acidic conditions (like H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) can oxidize a terminal alkyne to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, that's step 3 in option A: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So, that would oxidize an ethynyl group to a carboxylic acid. So, if the first step oxidizes the alkyne to a COOH group, then perhaps that's part of the process.

But the target molecule has a formyl (CHO) group, not a COOH. So, perhaps we need to reduce the COOH to a CHO. But that would require a reduction, which isn't straightforward. Another approach is to convert the alkyne into a ketone, but I'm not sure how to do that directly. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding a hydroxymethyl group and then oxidizing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a Grignard reagent or some kind of addition to the alkyne.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents step by step for each option.

Let's take Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a nucleophile. Maybe it's deprotonating something and then adding a methyl group. Or, perhaps it's an alkylation.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, often used for deprotonating or for elimination reactions, such as the Birch reduction or for forming alkenes via elimination.

Wait, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonating compounds to form anions, which can then react. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but our starting material isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first step, we have a compound that can undergo elimination upon treatment with Li/NH3. For example, if after step 1, we have a dihalide, then Li/NH3 would eliminate HX to form a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to map out each option.

Option D: Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, and then methylated. But methanol is a poor electrophile; perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, NaNH2 could deprotonate the alkyne, and then perform an alkylation with methanol? Maybe not, as methanol is not a good methylating agent.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is converting the alkyne into a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is often used in alkynolysis reactions, where an alkyne is treated with a base to form a dianion, which can then react with electrophiles. So, in the presence of methyl chloride, the alkyne would add a methyl group. So, the triple bond would go from C≡C to C-C with a methyl group attached.

Wait, so the starting material is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonated with NaNH2 gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^-. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would provide CH3+; the anion would attack, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that would make a 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane or something else? Or perhaps the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane, which is a longer alkyne.

Wait, but that's a possibility. Then, step 2 in option D is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base. Could it induce elimination, forming a double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate a compound to form a strong base, which could then react. But without knowing the structure after step 1, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the next step is to add another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the overall plan is to first add a methyl group to the alkyne, then perform a hydrogenation to add a hydrogen, and then do an oxidation to form the carbonyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the target molecule: it has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group, and then another substituent is added as the hydroxymethyl.

So, steps to achieve this:

1. Convert ethynyl group (-C≡CH) into a formyl group (-CHO).

2. Add a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) to the cyclohexane ring.

How to do that.

First, to get from -C≡CH to -CHO, perhaps oxidation is the way. But oxidation of terminal alkynes generally gives carboxylic acids. So, perhaps after getting a COOH group, we can reduce it to a CHO group.

Wait, but how? Once you have a carboxylic acid, you can reduce it to a primary alcohol, but then you would need to further oxidize it to a aldehyde, which is tricky because primary alcohols are typically oxidized all the way to carboxylic acids under strong oxidizing conditions. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps using a ketone as an intermediate. For that, the alkyne would need to be converted into a ketone, but I'm not sure how to do that directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: using hydroboration. But that's usually for alkenes, not alkynes. Alternatively, perhaps using O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. But in the target molecule, we only have one formyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is functionalized in a way that when ozonolysed, it forms the desired carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then ozonolysed.

Wait, perhaps the sequence involves hydrogenation followed by ozonolysis. Let me think.

If the first step is to hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if the ethynylcyclohexane is hydrogenated to cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2- group (but that's just a single bond, not a double bond). Wait, no: hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst would typically add two H2 molecules, converting the triple bond (C≡C) into a single bond (C-C). But if you use a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, you can get a cis double bond. So, perhaps the triple bond is first hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysed.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we don't have a double bond. So maybe after hydrogenation to a double bond, we can perform ozonolysis to add carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think again. If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and we hydrogenate the triple bond to a trans double bond, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target molecule has only one formyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl is converted into a vinyl group, which is then functionalized.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents in the options.

Option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, and (CH3)2S is a reductive workup. So, perhaps in this step, a double bond is being cleaved into carbonyl groups.

Let me think of the steps in option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

So, the first step: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Maybe this is an alkylation of the alkyne, adding a methyl group. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (a propargyl group?), attached to cyclohexane.

Then, step 2: H2 and Pd. This would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a propyl group. But the target has a formyl and hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, we have a CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Then, ozonolysis of a double bond, but wait, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so no double bond left. So, perhaps step 2 isn't hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the first step is deprotonation, then methyl group addition. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would convert the triple bond into a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, making a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane -> deprotonate with NaNH2, then methyl chloride adds methyl to alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Grignard-like reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule's structure suggests that a hydroxymethyl group is attached to the cyclohexane. Perhaps this is introduced via a hydroboration or hydroxylation step.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol, which is then hydroxylated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after adding a methyl group, we perform a dihydroxylation or some other addition to form a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for the sequence that introduces both the formyl and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding two substituents to the cyclohexane ring.

Looking at the options, some involve O3, which is ozonolysis, and others involve H2SO4 and HgSO4, which probably oxidize an alkyne to a carboxylic acid.

Option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of ketones to epoxides, but more commonly, it's used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Wait, but if the compound has a double bond, Ba(OH)2 wouldn't directly form an epoxide. Alternatively, it's used in the Jones oxidation, but that's usually with CrO3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: this would add an ethyl group to the alkyne, making a longer alkyne.

2. Li/liq. NH3: possibly elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm, so let's see. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group, making a propargyl group. Then, Li in NH3 would eliminate, forming a trans double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, with NH4OH (maybe a reductive workup?), perhaps the carbonyls are preserved.

But the target has only one formyl group and a hydroxymethyl. So, not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making a longer chain.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis, but the molecule after step 2 has a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that doesn't go all the way. But normally, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add enough H to make a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe hydrogenation of a triple bond under certain conditions can stop at a double bond, but I think that's more with different catalysts. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond. Whereas using Na and NH3 would give trans. But in this case, the catalyst is Pd with calcium carbonate, which is typically used for full hydrogenation.

So, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond becomes a single bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So, that doesn't fit. So, option C's step 3 would have nothing to react. So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps deprotonate and add a methyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3: elimination, maybe forming a double bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup.

So, let's imagine the process:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol. Suppose this deprotonates the alkyne to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- , which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile; perhaps it's a protonation? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol could form some kind of methylating agent, but I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps leading to elimination. If the structure after step 1 has a leaving group, elimination could form a double bond. But without knowing what's there, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, we have a di-substituted alkyne, which upon treatment with Li/NH3, undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. Maybe it's used to convert a ketone into a primary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups, which when worked up with (CH3)2S, would give aldehydes (since (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, avoiding overoxidation to carboxylic acids).

But I'm not entirely confident in this approach.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a formyl (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group through a series of steps, and another substituent is added via some kind of addition reaction.

Looking back at the reagents, option A includes Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 with HgSO4. Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but perhaps more importantly, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxidation of a glycol (diol) to a diacid. Alternatively, HgSO4 in H2SO4 is used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Wait, another possibility: the ethynyl group is oxidized to a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation and alkylation, adding a methyl group. Then, hydrogenation to a single bond. Then, some kind of oxidation to form the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation to a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to a double bond. Then, ozonolysis to break into carbonyls.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step's purpose.

Looking at the target molecule:

It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main substituents are a formyl and a CH2OH group attached to the cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group, and another substituent (CH2OH) is added.

So, perhaps the steps would be:

1. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group.

But how? Let's think. For a terminal alkyne, oxidation with HgSO4 in H2SO4 and H2O would give a carboxylic acid. Then, perhaps a reduction step could convert the carboxylic acid into a formyl group.

Wait, but that's tricky because reducing a carboxylic acid to a formyl group requires a specific condition. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into an aldehyde via a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone, but I don't know how.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, that could be a possible pathway. So, how?

If the alkyne is first reduced to a primary alcohol, then oxidized to the aldehyde.

So, steps would be:

1. Reduce the alkyne to a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But how would this fit into the given reagents?

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option B: step 3 is O3 and H2O, which is ozonolysis. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a
