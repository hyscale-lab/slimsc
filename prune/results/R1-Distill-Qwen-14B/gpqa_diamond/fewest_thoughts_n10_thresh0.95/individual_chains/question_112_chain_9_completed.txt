Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of this. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right. The state is given as proportional, so I should find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself.

So, let's write |alpha> as a linear combination: (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me call the coefficients a = 1+i and b=2-i. Then, the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. And |b|^2: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +1=5. So the normalization factor is sqrt(2 +5)=sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem asks about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The matrix representation for a spin operator in the z-basis. Hmm. Oh wait, the operator given is probably a spin in another direction. Like, perhaps the x or y component. Let me think.

The standard Pauli matrices: sigma_x has 0s on the diagonal and 1s on the off-diagonal, sigma_y has 0s on diagonal and i's on the off-diagonal. But wait, the given matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j. So perhaps this operator is (ħ/2)( |up><down| + |down><up| ), which is the same as sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if you multiply each element by ħ/2, you get A.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> with equal coefficients and a phase factor.

Wait, but in this problem, we're being asked to find the probability of measuring the system in each of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x> perhaps.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Once I do that, the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form a basis. So |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates.

Wait, but I can also compute the expectation value of A, which is the average value. So perhaps I should approach this by first finding the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in that basis, then find the probabilities and the expectation value.

Let me think about the operator A. Since A is given as (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, its eigenvalues can be found by solving (A - λI)|v> = 0.

The Pauli X matrix is diagonal in the |+x>, |-x> basis. So the eigenvalues of A would be ± (ħ/2). Because the eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they become ±ħ/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. The eigenstates of sigma_x (which is the same as A up to a scaling factor) are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by some phase factors. Wait, actually, the standard eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +x and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -x? Wait, no, maybe with a factor of i.

Wait, sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, etc. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct eigenstates are (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2) for +x and (|up> - i|down>)/sqrt(2) for -x. Wait, no, that's for sigma_y. Hmm, maybe I should better compute the eigenstates.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenvectors for +1 are vectors (a,b) such that [[0,1],[1,0]] [a,b]^T = [b,a]^T = [a,b]^T. So b=a. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T. Similarly, for -1, eigenvectors are proportional to [1,-1]^T.

So the eigenstates for A = (ħ/2) sigma_x would be |+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). But wait, wait. Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are those vectors, correct. Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>. So yes.

So now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A> because the measurement probabilities are the squares of the coefficients in this basis.

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+A> and |-A>.

First, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+A> and |-A>.

Because:

|+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So solving for |up> and |down>:

|up> = (|+A> + |-A>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+A> - |-A>)/sqrt(2)

Substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+A> + |-A>)/sqrt(2) ] + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+A> - |-A>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

|alpha> = [1/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2))] [ (1+i)(|+A> + |-A>) + (2-i)(|+A> - |-A>) ]

Combine the terms inside the brackets:

= [1/(sqrt(14))] [ (1+i + 2 - i)|+A> + (1+i - (2 - i)) |-A> ]

Simplify each coefficient:

Coefficients for |+A>:
(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

Coefficients for |-A>:
(1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So:

|alpha> = [3 / sqrt(14)] |+A> + [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] |-A>

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, expanding (1+i)(|+A> + |-A>) + (2-i)(|+A> - |-A>):

= (1+i)|+A> + (1+i)|-A> + (2-i)|+A> - (2-i)|-A>

Grouping terms:

|+A> [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] + |-A> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

So, coefficient for |+A>:

(1+i) + (2-i) = (1+2) + (i -i) )= 3.

Coefficient for |-A>:

(1+i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So yes, that's correct.

So, |alpha> = (3/sqrt(14)) |+A> + [ (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14) ] |-A>.

Now, the probability of measuring |+A> is |3/sqrt(14)|^2.

|3|^2 /14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64, which is close.

Similarly, the probability for |-A> is | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but let me compute 5/14 = approx 0.3571.

But looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which would be 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14 ≈0.357, which rounds to around 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 64.29% and 35.71%.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the expansion? Let me recheck.

Wait, when I expressed |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A>, perhaps I should have considered the expansion correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the way I combined the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the components differently. Let me try a different approach: since the eigenstates of A are |+A> and |-A>, which form an orthonormal basis, the probability of measuring |+A> is | < +A | alpha > |^2.

So let's compute < +A | alpha >.

The inner product is < +A | alpha > = [ < up | + < down | ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So that becomes:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, because < up | up > =1, < down | down > =1, and cross terms are zero since they're orthogonal.

So numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

Denominator: sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) = sqrt(14).

So < +A | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14).

Thus, the probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product with |-A> would be < -A | alpha >.

The state |-A> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Which equals [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] = (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14).

So the probability is | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, etc.

But wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is roughly 0.36. So the first part (probabilities) matches option A.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But A is a Hermitian operator, so <A> = sum of (probabilities * eigenvalues).

The eigenvalues of A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2).

Compute that: [9(ħ/2) -5(ħ/2)] /14.

Wait, no, wait. Because the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, so:

(9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2) = [9 -5]/(14) * ħ/2 = 4/(14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average value is ħ/7.

So option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, with average value hbar/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another approach to compute the average. Let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The matrix of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is a column vector. Let me write it as [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))(1-i) [0 (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2) (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + (1/sqrt(7))(2 +i) [ (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using matrices.

Alternatively, because A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, and for any state |psi>, <psi| sigma_x |psi> = (psi1)(psi2^*) + (psi2)(psi1^*).

Wait, let me double-check. The expectation value is <sigma_x> = [ (a)(d*) + (b)(c*) ] where |psi> = a|up> + b|down>.

Wait, no. Wait, sigma_x is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute <psi| sigma_x |psi>, it's (a* c + b* d), where |psi> = [a, b]^T and |phi> = [c, d]^T. Wait, no, |psi> is a column vector [a, b]^T, so <psi| sigma_x |psi> would be [a* b*] [[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b] = [a*, b*] [b, a] = a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b) if a and b are complex.

Wait, but let me compute it correctly.

Let me denote |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

So <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) * [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiplying out the matrices:

The middle part is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T /sqrt(7).

Which gives [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then multiply by the row vector [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, the product is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Each term is divided by 7.

So first term: (1-i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1(-i) -2i + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

Wait, no, let me compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

= 1*(2) + 1*(-i) -i*(2) + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum is (1-3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

Multiply by (ħ/2) and divide by 7: (ħ/2) * 2 /7 = ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier result.

So the average value is ħ/7, which is part of option A.

So the correct answer should be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the squared magnitude of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( \sqrt{2+5} = \sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state becomes:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Using the orthonormality of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the coefficients are computed as:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9 - 5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
