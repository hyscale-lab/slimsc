Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The setup is a bit tricky. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; instead, the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor is like a hollow sphere with a smaller sphere-shaped hole not at the center.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. But wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. Oh right, but when you put a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, in the case of a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor and equal charges on the outer surface. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the inner surface must have a charge -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance it.

But wait, the conductor isn't a perfect sphere because the cavity is off-center. Does that affect the electric field outside? I think for a conductor, the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge. Since the outer surface has +q, the field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait a second, so if the conductor is a sphere, even if the cavity is off-center, the external field would be the same as if the charge were at the center. Because the conductor is a sphere, it's symmetrical, so the induced charges redistribute in such a way that the external field is only due to the total charge enclosed.

But let me think more carefully. The conductor is spherical, so even though the cavity is off-center, the induced charges on the inner surface are such that the net field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. But what about the outer surface?

Oh, the outer surface has a charge +q, so the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if the charge were at the center. Because the conductor shields the inner structure from the outside.

So the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, should only depend on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the formula would be similar to the field from a point charge.

The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L. But wait, the charge is distributed on the outer surface, so the effective distance is L. So the electric field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That would be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure. The point P is outside, right? So the field only depends on the total charge of the outer shell. The fact that the cavity's charge is off-center doesn't affect the outer field because the conductor's symmetry ensures that the outer charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center.

So looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems correct.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the radius of the cavity is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

For a conductor, charges reside on the surface, and the conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor develops a charge $+q$. Since the conductor is spherical, the induced charges redistribute symmetrically, ensuring that the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, which is $+q$. The field outside the conductor is therefore identical to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

The electric field at point $P$, which is outside the conductor, is given by the formula for the field due to a point charge:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to option B. The fact that the cavity is off-center or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the external field because the conductor's symmetry ensures that the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

**Answer: B**
