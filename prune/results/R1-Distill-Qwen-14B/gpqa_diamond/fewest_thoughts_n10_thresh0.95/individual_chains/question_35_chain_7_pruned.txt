Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). My task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then determine which of the given options is correct based on that calculation.

First, let me write down what I know. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Wait, but before that, what's the matrix S look like? The first row is 0 and -i, so I think it's:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), so A_y = c * S. So the matrix A_y would be:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
         [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

But wait, no. Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, and A_y is c multiplied by each element of S. So each element of A_y is c times the corresponding element of S.

So let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so:

A_y = c * S = [ [0, -i c ],
               [i c, 0 ] ]

Which in terms of h and π is:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, okay. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to find the determinant of (A_y - a I) and set it to zero. The matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ -a      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h/(4π))² ]

Calculating the second term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1) * (h²/(16π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait. Because when you take the square root of a² = (h/(4π))², you get a=± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait again. The matrix S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is:

Y = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Which is exactly our S matrix. And I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So for S, the eigenvalues are ±1. Then, when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y (which is c*S) would be c*(±1), so c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

So looking at the options, which one matches this? Let's check the options.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but I just found the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So this option says the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts? That can't be right because the operator A_y is Hermitian, I think. Wait, is it? Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, right? So their eigenvalues should be real. So the eigenvalues are real and of magnitude h/(4π). So option A's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which would mean they're complex, which can't be right. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That would imply eigenvalues like 1 + i*(1/2), which are complex. But as I said, the eigenvalues are real, so option B is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, A_z. Hmm. Let's think. The eigenfunctions of A_y are the eigenvectors of the Pauli Y matrix. Since A_y is a component of angular momentum, A² is the total angular momentum squared, which commutes with each component. So the eigenfunctions of A_y should also be eigenfunctions of A². But what about A_z? Well, the angular momentum components don't commute with each other, so the eigenvectors of A_y are not eigenvectors of A_z. So option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct. So this option could be a candidate.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis vectors in the space. So the eigenvectors of A_y would form an orthonormal basis. So the statement says that the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick because the operator is 2x2, so the basis is two-dimensional, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D might be correct as well.

Wait, but let's look at each option more carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought, since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the statement is correct. Because A² is the total angular momentum, and it commutes with Ay (since [A², Ay] = 0), so their eigenvectors can be shared.

But what about Az? Well, the components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it cannot be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only happens in certain cases. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix representation is in a certain basis, which is typically the computational basis (like the z-basis when dealing with spin-½ particles). But the eigenvectors of Ay form an orthonormal basis for the space (since it's diagonalizable). So the statement is a bit ambiguous, but I'm not sure if it's correct. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think that the basis is determined by the choice of representation, so maybe option D is correct in the sense that the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's matrix. Alternatively, perhaps the operator's matrix is written in the standard basis, and the eigenvectors are not necessarily the same as the standard basis vectors.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvectors. Let's compute them.

So for Ay, the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Because Ay is c * S, and S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, so the eigenvectors of S are the same as the eigenvectors of Ay, scaled by c, but the eigenvectors themselves are the same because scaling a matrix by a scalar doesn't change its eigenvectors.

So the eigenvectors of S (and hence Ay) can be found.

The Pauli Y matrix has eigenvectors |+> and |->, which are |+y> and |−y> states.

The eigenvectors for S (eigenvalue +1) is (1, i)/√2, and for -1 is (1, -i)/√2.

Wait, let me compute this. Let me solve (S - (+1)I) |v> = 0.

The matrix S - I is [ -1, -i; i, -1 ].

So the equations are:

- v1 - i v2 = 0,
i v1 - v2 = 0.

From the first equation: v1 = -i v2.

Substituting into the second equation: i*(-i v2) - v2 = 0 → (i*(-i)) v2 - v2 = ( (-i^2) )v2 - v2 = (1)v2 - v2 = 0. So 0=0. So v2 is a free variable.

So let's take v2 =1, then v1 = -i *1 = -i. So the eigenvector is (-i, 1). But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-i)(i) + (1)(1) ) because |a|^2 + |b|^2. (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1, and 1^2 =1. So norm squared is 2. So the normalized vector is ( -i/√2 , 1/√2 ).

Similarly, for the eigenvalue -1, we solve (S + I) |v> =0.

The matrix is [1, -i; i, 1].

Equations: v1 - i v2 =0 and i v1 + v2=0.

From first equation: v1 = i v2.

Substitute into second: i*(i v2) + v2 = (-1) v2 + v2 =0. So again, v2 is a free variable.

Take v2=1, then v1= i*1= i. So the vector is (i, 1). Normalizing: same as before, norm squared is (i)(-i) +1 = 1 +1=2. So unit vector is (i/√2, 1/√2).

So the eigenvectors are ( -i/√2, 1/√2 ) and ( i/√2, 1/√2 ).

Wait, but these are eigenvectors in the standard basis. So the operator Ay's matrix is in the standard basis, and its eigenvectors are these vectors.

So the statement in option D says: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The basis functions would be the basis vectors of the space the operator is acting on. So if the operator is represented in the standard basis, then its matrix is as given, and the eigenvectors are not necessarily the same as the basis. Unless the operator is diagonal in the standard basis, which it's not because S is not diagonal in the standard basis.

So the eigenvectors do not form the standard basis. So the statement in option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis functions (the standard basis vectors) of the operator. So option D is incorrect.

So looking back at the options, the correct statements must be either C or D, but I think C is correct.

Wait, but what about option C? It says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. I agree with that because A² commutes with Ay, so yes, their eigenvectors are shared. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenvectors of Ay won't be eigenvectors of Az. So option C is correct.

So the correct statement is option C or option D.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they are not eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So among the options, only option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These
