Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the particles' positions, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. The question is to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit strange because the wave function usually is a complex number, but I'm not sure how that ties into the problem. Oh, wait, maybe the real part is the (a / sqrt(...)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But I'm probably overcomplicating.

Wait, the wave function being zero outside x=1 and x=3 suggests that it's zero for x <1 and x >3. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but I don't see any exponential decay terms or something that would make it zero beyond x=3.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Or perhaps the wave function as given is valid only within this region, and zero outside. Wait, the question says the wave function can be described as that in a part of space where it can exist. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is for that region.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. For this to be a valid wave function, it must be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

So the normalization condition is integral |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Let me compute that. So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is 0.5i, so its square magnitude is (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding them, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me calculate that.

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), and it is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1.

The probability density is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), we get \( \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \). Thus, this part becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \): This is simply \( 0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we calculate:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root, \( a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85 \).

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
