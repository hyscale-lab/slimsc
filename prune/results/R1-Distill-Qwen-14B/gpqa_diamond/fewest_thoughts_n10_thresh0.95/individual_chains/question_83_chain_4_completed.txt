Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

First, I'll try to outline what I remember about titrations. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, the acetic acid will donate a proton to the hydroxide ions from NaOH, forming acetate ions and water.

The reaction should be something like:
CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

Right, so the key steps might involve calculating the initial concentrations after dilution, then figuring out the moles at the 25% point and at equivalence, and using that to find pH.

Let me jot down the given data:
- Volume of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters)
- Concentration of acetic acid: 0.05 M
- Water added: 20.00 cm³, so total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters)
- NaOH concentration: 0.1 M

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.

Hmm, I think I should start by finding the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

So initial concentration of acetic acid before dilution is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³.

So C2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait: 0.05 * 20 = 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Because when we dilute, the moles stay the same. So initial moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 0.04 L, the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next step: when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's find out how much NaOH is used at 25% and at equivalence.

But wait, what's the equivalence point? At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. 25% of the equivalence point. So during the titration, the volume added would be 2.5 cm³.

But sometimes, it's easier to think in terms of moles. Let's see.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

So let's approach each part step by step.

First, pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So some of it has been converted to acetate, and the rest remains as acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has reacted, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So the new moles are:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol

Wait, but wait—what about the total volume? Because the solution is diluted to 40 cm³ before titration, and then we add NaOH. So the total volume when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added would be 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Wait, but wait—no, no, no. Wait a minute. The initial solution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 cm³ acetic acid plus 20 cm³ water. Then, when you add 2.5 cm³ NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- would be:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but wait, alternative approach: Maybe it's better to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because when you have a buffer solution, which is the case during the titration before equivalence, the pH can be calculated using pKa and the ratio of concentrations.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So, let's compute pKa first. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is approximately 4.733.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.2672. So pKa = 4.733.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA) = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is negative. Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Wait, that's about 4.26, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says pH 4.26 at 25%, and 8.52 at equivalence. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. But wait, this is just the 25% part, let's check the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions in a solution volume of 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so Kb is small, so we can use the approximation.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is the [OH^-], so:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is 5.017. So pOH ≈ 4.983 → pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, that's approximately 9.02. But none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: equivalence pH is 8.52. Option D: 6.92. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid (like acetate), the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

So the correct approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence point.

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in the Kb value. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the solution volume is 50 cm³ (40 + 10 cm³), so 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001/0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe I should set up the equation without approximation.

Let me write the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be [OH^-] → [CH3COOH] = x.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH is about 9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10, yes. So the Kb is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume. Let me recheck. The initial solution is 40 cm³ (20 +20). At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, so total solution is 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have a pH close to 9. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the calculation for the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, when the solution is at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution should be basic, as I thought.

But I'm getting pH around 9, but the options do not have this. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → 25% is 4.26, equivalence 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these have anything around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of a weak base. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another way to approach the equivalence point:

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At equivalence, it's all converted to acetate, 0.001 mol, in 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Let me set up the equation:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x)

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M → [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait a second, let's recheck the initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol, yes. So at equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is 4.733.

Then, Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, perhaps the correct pH is around 9.02, but none of the options match. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier part, the 25% titration.

Wait, wait. Let me think: perhaps I should have considered the fact that when we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration changes, but then when we add NaOH, the solution's volume increases, so I might have made a mistake in the concentrations.

Wait, let's re-calculate the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001 mol. So after adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, which reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Wait, 0.005882 / 0.017647 is approximately 0.3333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.

That's approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Hmm, but then the equivalence point is around 9, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in that part.

Wait another thought: Could the equivalence point calculation be wrong? Because maybe the solution is not just acetate; perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate in solution, considering the hydrolysis.

Wait, the correct approach is:

At equivalence, you have 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] → let's write the expression as:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) → since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But why isn't this matching any options? Let's see what the options have.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me check:

Original acetic acid volume: 20 cm³, 0.05 M → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Yes.

After adding 20 cm³ water, dilution to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, no mistake there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the equivalence point was miscalculated because the molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, which is correct.

Wait, so the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.

Moles acetic acid = 0.001 mol. So moles NaOH needed: 0.001 mol.

At 0.1 M NaOH, volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So that's correct.

So the volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³, 0.05 L.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733.

Kw is 1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not 0.05 L. Wait, 10 cm³ added to 40 cm³ is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So correct.

Hmm, but the pH of 9.02 doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the Kb for the acetate ion, but maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the solution is not just acetate but perhaps a buffer? No, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so it's just acetate in solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Ka. Let me recheck the Ka given.

The problem states Ka is 1.85e-5. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the equivalence point isn't 9.02, but the option expects me to calculate it another way. Let's see what the options say for equivalence pH.

Options:

A) equivalence pH 8.52

B) 6.73

C)7.00

D)6.92

Hmm, 8.52 is the only one near 8.5, which is lower than my calculated 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb value.

Wait, let me check the calculation for Kb again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5 → Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

Wait, 1 / 1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the autoionization of water or some other factor, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for a weak base more accurately, without the approximation.

Let me set up the equation without the approximation.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

Which is what I did before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Maybe the initial acetic acid solution after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck that.

Initial acetic acid volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the problem is about the 25% titration's pH, and the equivalence point is 4.57 and 6.92, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH after 25% of the titration using the buffer equation and considering the dilution correctly.

Wait, let me redo the 25% calculation more carefully.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Moles of NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733, log(1/3) is -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256 → approx 4.26. So the first part of option A is 4.26.

But for the equivalence point, I'm getting pH around 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point using a different approach, such as considering the hydrolysis of acetate, but perhaps using the exact quadratic equation instead of the approximation.

Let me try that.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Let me write the equation as x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x).

Expanding: x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a =1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → (2.921e-19) +4.324e-11 → approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x ≈3.288e-6 → [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH =5.485 → pH =14-5.485=8.515.

Ah! So pH is approximately 8.52. That matches option A, which has 8.52 as the equivalence pH.

Wait, so why did I get a different result when I used the approximation? Because in the approximation, I said x is much smaller than 0.02, but perhaps in reality, x is about 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold, but why then did the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, this can't be. Because when I did the approximation, I got x≈1.04e-5, but when solving the quadratic, I got x≈3.288e-6. That's a big discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Wait, let me recompute the quadratic solution.

The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → approx 29.21 * 1e-20 =2.921e-19.

4ac = 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → no, wait, no, 4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → 4*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11? Wait no, wait, no. Because the equation is x² +b x +c=0, so when you compute 4ac, the c here is -1.081e-11. So 4ac is 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → which would be 4 * (-1.081e-11) → which is -4.324e-11.

Wait, but in the equation, D = b² -4ac. Because in the standard quadratic formula, it's ax² +bx +c =0, so D= b² -4ac.

Wait, earlier I think I made a mistake in the sign. Because in our equation, c is negative.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Which becomes (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11 +2.921e-19 → which is about 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → approximately 6.576e-6.

So x = [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a) → [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) / 2 → approx (6.5755e-6)/2 →3.28775e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.28775e-6 → pOH = -log(3.28775e-6) → log(3.28775)=0.516, so 5.483 → pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517.

So approximately 8.52. Which now, after redoing the quadratic, gives pH ≈8.52.

Which matches option A's equivalence point pH of 8.52.

But earlier, when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]≈1.04e-5, which would give pOH≈4.98, pH≈9.02. But that's not matching.

So where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, wait, because when I used the approximation, I set 0.02 -x ≈0.02, but perhaps that's not valid if x is not negligible compared to 0.02. Wait, but x is 3.28e-6, which is 3.28e-6 <<0.02 (2e-2), so the approximation should hold. So why is there a discrepancy between the two methods?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the quadratic equation.

Wait, the correct equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.

So, x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) → x²=1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, solving it with the approximation gives x≈1.04e-5, which is larger than 3.28e-6. So there must be a mistake in the approximation. Oh wait, perhaps the approximation isn't valid because I have x ≈3.28e-6, which is 3.28e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 is much larger than x, so the approximation holds. So why the difference between the two methods?

Wait, perhaps the initial approximation was incorrect, and the quadratic gives a more accurate result. So, the exact calculation gives pH≈8.52, which is what option A says for the equivalence point.

So, putting it all together.

At 25% titration: pH≈4.26.

At equivalence: pH≈8.52.

Which matches option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as \(1.85 \times 10^{-5}\), and the volume of the diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³ (20 cm³ acetic acid + 20 cm³ water).

### 1. **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now \(40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}\). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### 2. **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is calculated as:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \([ \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- ] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values correspond to **Option A**.
