Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, symmetry in molecules... I remember that symmetry elements like axes, planes, and centers can determine the symmetry group of a molecule. C3h symmetry specifically refers to a certain type of point group. Let me think.

Point groups are categorized based on their symmetry elements. C3h is a type of point group that has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a mirror plane (σ), and also an inversion center (i), I think. Wait, no, maybe that's another group. Wait, maybe C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or perhaps it's a combination. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Well, the molecules in the options are: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo... something with trifuran, and another triphenyleno... trifuran. Let me try to visualize each.

Triisopropyl borate: I think that's a borate with three isopropyl groups attached. So the structure would be like B(OCH(CH2CH3)2)3. So it's a central boron atom with three bulky isopropyl groups. Is this molecule symmetric? Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have some symmetry. Maybe a C3 axis because the three groups are identical? So rotating 120 degrees around the boron would map the molecule onto itself. So if it has a three-fold rotation axis, that's C3. But does it have a mirror plane or inversion? If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps a C3h point group. Or maybe it's just C3.

Quinuclidine: I remember quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure, like a bridge between two rings. It's a saturated molecule with a bridgehead. I think quinuclidine has a three-membered ring fused to another ring, making a bridge. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, right? So it has a bridge over three carbons on each bridge. So does it have a C3h symmetry? Or maybe it's a different point group. I think quinuclidine has a C3 axis because of the three bridges. But what about mirror planes? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it has a plane of symmetry, but I'm not certain.

The third option is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Trifuran means three furan rings, I think. But the benzo substitution might complicate things. Benzo implies a benzene ring attached. So this could be a structure where a benzene is fused to a trifuran system. I'm not sure of the exact structure, but I'm thinking about symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it has a higher symmetry. If the benzene is in a position that allows for mirror planes or a three-fold axis, then perhaps C3h.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene suggests three benzene rings attached, perhaps in a symmetric fashion. Trifuran again, so three furan rings. So the molecule could have a central structure with multiple substituents. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. If the substituents are equally spaced and symmetric, then C3h symmetry is possible.

Now, thinking about C3h symmetry. C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which includes the axis. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees (three times) and also has a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. Or wait, maybe the C3h group includes a three-fold rotation plus a σh plane. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that lies in the same plane as the rotation axis.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis and any mirror planes. Let's go molecule by molecule.

1. Triisopropyl borate: The structure is symmetrical with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, the groups swap places but the molecule looks the same. So that's a C3 axis. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Looking at the structure, each isopropyl group is attached to the boron in a trigonal planar arrangement. So there might be a plane that bisects the molecule. For example, if you take a plane that goes through the boron and one of the isopropyl groups, maybe that's a mirror plane. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical in all three directions, perhaps each plane that includes the C3 axis is a mirror plane. So that would make it have multiple σ planes. If the molecule has a C3 axis and a σ plane, the point group would be C3h, but wait, no. C3h has a C3 and an σh (a horizontal mirror plane). Alternatively, if it's C3 with only σ planes that are not horizontal, maybe it's different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual point groups. C3h is a subgroup of D3d, I think. D3d has a C3 axis, several mirror planes, and a center of inversion. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a mirror plane, the point group could be D3 or C3h depending on whether the mirror plane is perpendicular (for D3) or horizontal (for C3h). Alternatively, maybe C3h is a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry. Since the three isopropyl groups are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule could belong to the Td point group. Wait, no, because the central atom is boron, which is tetrahedral, but the molecule is trigonal planar? Wait, no, the actual structure of triisopropyl borate is [B(O-i-Pr)3], where each O is connected to B and an isopropyl group. So the arrangement around B is trigonal planar, with each O connected to an isopropyl. So the molecule would have a C3 axis (since rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself), and each of the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically. So what's the point group?

In such a structure, if the molecule has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry (each passing through the C3 axis and one isopropyl group), then the point group would be D3h? Or maybe C3v? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe triisopropyl borate has a C3v symmetry because it has a three-fold axis and three mirror planes. But I'm not entirely certain.

Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. I think it has a three-fold axis because the bridge is symmetric. So rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Looking at quinuclidine, it's a bicyclic structure with three bridges of two carbons each. Each bridge is like a CH2 group. So if you imagine a plane that cuts through the bridgehead carbons, perhaps that's a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric along a plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So if it has a C3 axis and at least one mirror plane, it might belong to the C3h group. Or perhaps C3v? I'm not sure.

The third option is the benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone. Benzo suggests a benzene ring fused to the structure. Trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: that's a structure with three furan rings connected in a certain way, and the benzo is attached in positions 1,2-c and so on. I'm not exactly sure, but maybe this molecule has a central ring with substituents arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are in a trigonal arrangement, perhaps it has a C3 symmetry. But the benzene ring might introduce some asymmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it could have C3h symmetry.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone. Triphenylene would imply three benzene rings attached. If these are arranged in a symmetric fashion, perhaps around a central point, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis. For example, if each benzene is attached to a three-fold axis, spaced 120 degrees apart, then the molecule could have a C3 axis. Additionally, if there's a mirror plane (maybe a plane that includes the C3 axis and one of the substituents), then the point group might be C3h.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated without the actual structures in front of me. Maybe I should think about each option's likely symmetry.

Another angle: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry? I remember that molecules like triphenylene have certain symmetries. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is a good candidate.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule? No, the boron is in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule would be flat, but each isopropyl group is like a three-dimensional substituent. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) but what about mirror planes? If any, perhaps a plane that goes through the boron and each isopropyl group. But since the molecule is symmetric in those planes, each plane that includes the C3 axis and a substituent would be a mirror plane. So that would make it have multiple σ planes, perhaps leading to a higher symmetry like D3h. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, only the rotation axis. So perhaps it's C3, but not C3h. So which of the options is more likely to have C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the presence of C3h symmetry requires that the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So when you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the C3 axis, it looks the same, and when you reflect it across the mirror plane, it also looks the same.

Looking for a molecule that has both a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane in the same direction.

Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclic molecule, which I believe has a three-fold axis of rotation. Also, it has a plane of symmetry that includes the C3 axis. So perhaps the point group is C3h.

Wait, no, quinuclidine's structure: if you have a bridge between three pairs of carbons, each bridge is CH2, then the molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation. Also, there's a plane that could act as a mirror plane. So quinuclidine's point group is C3, or perhaps C3h.

Wait, checking online (if I could), I recall that quinuclidine belongs to the C3h point group. No, wait, I think it actually belongs to the C3 point group because it has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes. Alternatively, maybe it has mirror planes, making it C3v or D3h.

Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno... has a higher symmetry. Triphenylene is C6 symmetric, I think, but when it's attached to a trifuran, maybe the symmetry is reduced. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone.

Option C: triisopropyl borate.

Option D: quinuclidine.

Wait, the options given are A, B, C, D, but the question lists four molecules, so the options correspond as A, B, C, D to those four.

The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry.

I think quinuclidine is likely to have a C3 axis but perhaps no mirror plane. So maybe it's C3, not C3h.

Triisopropyl borate, as I thought earlier, has a C3 axis and perhaps multiple mirror planes, making its point group D3h or C3v. So if it's D3h, that's a higher symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another thought: C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. If a molecule has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that includes that axis, then it's C3h.

If triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis and a mirror plane that includes that axis, then yes. So that would fit C3h.

Alternatively, if it's just C3 without a mirror plane, then it's C3.

Wait, but in triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is identical and arranged symmetrically around the boron. So any plane that passes through the boron and one of the substituents could be a mirror plane. So if you have three such planes, each containing the C3 axis and one substituent, then the point group would be D3h, which includes a C3 axis, three mirrors, and an inversion center. But without the inversion, perhaps it's C3v.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I think quinuclidine is a known molecule with C3h symmetry. Wait, no, I think quinuclidine actually has a three-fold axis and a plane of symmetry, making it belong to the C3v point group. Or perhaps D3h. Wait, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the answer options.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I've heard that triisopropyl borate is a molecule with a trigonal planar geometry around boron, which suggests a C3 axis. If it has no other symmetry elements, then it would be C3. If it has mirror planes, perhaps C3v or D3h.

But C3h is a subset of D3h? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options have C3h, but that can't be right.

Wait, another thought. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. If I can't figure it out, perhaps I should recall that triphenylene has a higher symmetry. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule with three benzene rings arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. So triphenylene might belong to the D3h point group. If it's attached to a trifuran in a symmetric way, perhaps the resulting molecule has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno... has a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the benzo... structure (option B) might not have sufficient symmetry because the benzo group might break the three-fold symmetry.

Wait, think about C3h: it's a combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also mirror reflection across a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Looking for a molecule where this is true.

Quinuclidine: The structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a three-fold axis. It also has a plane of symmetry that includes the three-fold axis. For example, imagine a plane slicing through the center of the molecule, including the bridgeheads. Reflecting across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So quinuclidine would have both a C3 axis and a σ plane that includes the axis, which would make it C3h.

Wait, if that's the case, then option D (quinuclidine) would have C3h symmetry.

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it might have a higher symmetry.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis and several mirror planes, making it D3h. So it would have C3h as a subgroup. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For C3h, the mirror plane (σh) is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So for example, if the molecule is like trigonal planar with substituents in three positions, and a mirror plane that reflects across a horizontal axis (like the plane of the table), then it would have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, but in triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl is in a trigonal plane around the boron. So a horizontal mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule itself. Wait, no, the plane might not be a mirror. Alternatively, the mirror planes are vertical, each passing through a substituent and the C3 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, because it has a C3 axis and multiple mirror planes.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry. I'm not very familiar with the specifics, but I think quinuclidine might have a lower symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe none of the options have C3h symmetry, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach. Let me try to visualize each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate: It's a symmetrical molecule with B in the center and three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar around B, so it has a C3 axis. Each substituent is identical, so it's symmetric. Are there any mirror planes? Yes, because if you take a plane that includes the C3 axis and one substituent, the molecule would be symmetric across that plane. But that would be three mirror planes, each perpendicular to each other. So the symmetry would be D3h.

Wait, D3h is a point group that includes a C3 axis, three mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis), and a horizontal mirror plane? Or is that another group.

Wait, D3h has a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that includes the C3 axis, and other symmetry elements. So if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be D3h. Alternatively, if it only has three vertical mirror planes and a C3 axis, perhaps it's D3h.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of symmetry elements each option has.

Quinuclidine: It has a C3 axis and a mirror plane that includes the C3 axis. So that would make it C3h symmetry.

Wait, no. Because for C3h, the molecule must have a C3 axis and a σh plane. If quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a σ plane, but that plane is not horizontal, then it's C3v (if the mirror plane is vertical) or D3h (if more planes are present). Alternatively, if the mirror plane is horizontal, then it's C3h.

But I'm not certain about quinuclidine's actual point group.

Alternatively, perhaps none of these options have C3h symmetry, but that can't be. The question says one of them does.

Another thought: molecules with a three-membered ring often have C3 symmetry. Maybe the fourth option has that.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to make an educated guess. Triisopropyl borate is a symmetrical molecule with a C3 axis and likely a σ plane, so it would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, it could have a higher symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule can be reflected across a plane that lies in the same direction as the rotation axis, then it's C3h.

Triisopropyl borate: if the molecule is flat, like a trigonal planar, then reflecting across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (i.e., a horizontal plane) would leave it unchanged. So that would be a σh plane, making the point group C3h.

But wait, the molecule is planar, so the mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule, which is horizontal. So yes, that would give it a σh plane. So for triisopropyl borate, the presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane would make it C3h.

So option C is triisopropyl borate, which would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, I think in reality, triisopropyl borate is a tetrahedral molecule, but no, wait, wait. Wait, the boron is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is connected to an isopropyl group. So the geometry around boron is trigonal planar, making the molecule flat. So it's likely to have a σh plane that is the plane of the molecule.

So combining the C3 axis and the σh plane, the point group would be C3h.

So I think the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident about quinuclidine. Maybe I should think again.

Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold axis, and if a plane includes the axis and two bridgeheads, perhaps that's a mirror plane. So in that case, it would have a C3 axis and a σ plane that includes the axis. But would that make it C3h? Or another group.

Alternatively, if the mirror plane is horizontal, then yes, C3h. But if it's a vertical mirror plane, then the point group would be C3v.

But I'm not certain. Without the exact structure, it's hard, but I think triisopropyl borate is more likely to have C3h symmetry.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that includes the C₃ axis. Let us evaluate each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran system fused with a triphenylene structure. The triphenylene component has three benzene rings arranged symmetrically around a central point. However, the fusion with the trifuran system likely introduces asymmetry. While the molecule may have some symmetry, it does not clearly satisfy the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry due to the complex fusion pattern.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a trifuran system fused with a benzene ring. The benzo substitution disrupts the symmetry of the trifuran core, making it unlikely for this molecule to have **C₃h** symmetry. The asymmetry introduced by the benzo group prevents the molecule from having both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. This structure has a clear **C₃** axis due to the three-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, the molecule lies in a plane, which acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Since it satisfies both the **C₃** and σₕ requirements, this molecule belongs to the **C₃h** symmetry group.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with three bridges of two carbons each. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to its symmetric arrangement. However, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Instead, it has vertical mirror planes. Therefore, quinuclidine does not belong to the **C₃h** symmetry group but rather to a related group like **C₃v**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
