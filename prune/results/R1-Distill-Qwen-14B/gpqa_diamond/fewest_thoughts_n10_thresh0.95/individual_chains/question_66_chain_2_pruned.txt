Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates the Standard Model along with higher-dimensional operators to describe beyond the Standard Model physics. But wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, what's Lorentz symmetry? Oh right, it's the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so I think SMEFT would respect that too. Operators in SMEFT are typically constructed in a way that preserves Lorentz symmetry, so all operators must have it. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in spacetime. So it's a larger symmetry group. Well, the Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, but in SMEFT, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect translations? I think yes because the SMEFT is formulated as a low-energy effective theory, which usually incorporates the symmetries of the original theory. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but wait—some people get confused between Lorentz and Poincare. If an operator respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. Oh, right, because in effective field theories, the operators are local and translationally invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must have both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry (option 3) is about charge conjugation and parity. But SMEFT doesn't necessarily require all operators to respect CP. In fact, some operators can violate CP, especially when considering beyond the SM physics, which might include CP-violating terms. For example, the CKM matrix in the Standard Model already has CP violation, so SMEFT can have operators that break CP. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry (option 4) is a bigger symmetry combining charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. I remember that in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT symmetric. Because of the connection between Lorentz symmetry and CPT from the spin-statistics theorem and other fundamental aspects. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it together: the symmetries that all SMEFT operators must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait—earlier I thought the question includes all operators. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the question is, which of these four must each operator adhere to.

But wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So when the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But what about Poincare? Poincare includes translations, so all operators must be local, which is true in EFTs. So the operators must respect Poincare as well. So 1 and 2 must both be respected.

But the question is, which of the options (options given are 1,2,3,4) must all operators respect. So for each operator, it must be invariant under Lorentz and Poincare. So which of the given options are correct? Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2 (Lorentz and Poincare)
B) 3,4 (CP and CPT)
C) 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT)
D) 1,3,4 (Lorentz, CP, CPT)

Wait, but if all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then the correct group would be 1,2,4. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, wait. Do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a separate condition beyond Lorentz symmetry because operators are local, so they automatically respect translations. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects Poincare, so all operators must respect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars and Poincare invariant, so yes, 1 and 2. But wait, no—Poincare includes translations, which are part of the EFT framework. I think that the EFT approach ensures that operators are local, meaning they respect translations, so Poincare symmetry is automatically respected.

So, for each operator, they must be invariant under Lorentz and Poincare. But then what about CPT? Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must also be CPT-invariant. So each operator must respect Lorentz, which implies CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.

But looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT). But I'm not sure if the question includes Poincare as a separate symmetry that must be respected. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators." So operators are required to respect which of the four. So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but what about Poincare? An operator that's a Lorentz scalar and local (i.e., constructed from fields and their derivatives, without any non-local terms) will automatically respect translations. So in SMEFT, all operators are local and thus respect Poincare. So all operators respect Poincare.

So, the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the options would be option C: 1,2,4. But looking at the given options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, the options are:

Option C is 1,2,4. So it's Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct answer would include all three.

But wait, the question asks which must be respected by all operators. So which of the four symmetries listed must each operator respect.

Another approach: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Hence, Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

Poincare symmetry (2) is about the full symmetry group, including translations. Since all operators are local, they must respect Poincare as well. So 2 is also correct.

CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected because the Standard Model already has CP violation, and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So not all operators must respect CP.

CPT symmetry (4): SME
