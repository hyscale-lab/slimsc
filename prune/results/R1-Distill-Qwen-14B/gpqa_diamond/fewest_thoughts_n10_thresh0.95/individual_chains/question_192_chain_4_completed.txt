Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor has a radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere (the conductor) and a smaller sphere (cavity) somewhere inside it, not necessarily at the center because s is the distance between the centers. The radius of the cavity is smaller than R, which makes sense.

Then, they place a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and at a distance l from the center of the cavity. Also, l and L are both greater than R, meaning P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the electric field at point P due to the charge q, considering the setup with the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and electric fields. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. The charges in the conductor will redistribute themselves. But here, the conductor is initially uncharged, and then a charge is placed inside the cavity.

I think the method here involves considering the induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces. Let me think. When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will develop an induced charge. Specifically, the inner surface will have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, and the charge q is positive. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part closest to the cavity) should have a charge of -q, right? Because the induced charges would be opposite to the enclosed charge.

But wait, since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface has -q, which means the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner cavity's inner surface has -q.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? Well, for a conducting shell, the electric field outside is determined by the total charge on the conductor. Since the conductor's total charge is +q on the outer surface, the electric field outside should be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center, right? Because the outer surface's charge distribution is spherical symmetric when considering external points.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the electric field outside (at point P) would be like that of a point charge +q at the center. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is given by Coulomb's law as E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q_outer / r², where r is the distance from the center.

But in this problem, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. However, the charge q is inside the cavity, which is offset from the center by a distance s. So, does the position of the cavity's center relative to the conductor's center affect the external electric field?

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and it's a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface will have a charge distribution that is symmetric as if it's a point charge at the center. Therefore, the electric field outside should depend only on the total charge and the distance from the conductor's center.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L, but the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, it's shifted. So does that affect the field outside? Or does the conductor's induced charges take care of any asymmetry? Because the conductor is a conductor, and the induced charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves such that the field inside the conductor is zero, but the external field would depend only on the total charge.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the external field is as if a point charge +q is at the center. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the external field would be the same as if the charge were at the center. Because the conductor's own induced charges on the outer surface would symmetrically arrange to produce that effect.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor's outer surface has +q. But when I think about electrostatic induction, if the internal charge is off-center, the inner surface of the conductor will have a negative charge, but the outer surface would have a positive charge. However, the outer surface's charge distribution would arrange to ensure that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So, when considering points outside, the field would be as if the charge +q were at the center, because any asymmetry would cause the field inside the conductor to have some components, which is not allowed.

Wait, but in reality, if the internal charge is not at the center, the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge distribution that's not uniform. It would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. However, the outer surface must then have a charge distribution that accounts for any displacement. But wait, for a conducting shell with a displaced charge inside, the inner surface has an induced charge opposite to the internal charge, and the outer surface has a charge equal to the conductor's net charge.

Wait, in this problem, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, since the total conductor's charge is zero (initially uncharged, and the +q on the inner surface is balanced by the +q on the outer surface? Or wait, no: the conductor initially has no charge. So when +q is placed inside the cavity (which is inside the conductor's material?), the conductor’s inner surface must have -q, and since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, conductor is neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have -q. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. The conductor starts with no charge. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have a charge of -q because of induction. But the conductor's total charge must still be zero, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So the outer surface has +q, which is the same as the charge placed in the cavity in the opposite sign on the inner surface. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge. Since the outer surface is a conductor, the charges on it will arrange themselves in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. So, for points outside, the field is as if all the +q were at the center of the conductor. So the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait. The point P is given in terms of distance l from the cavity's center and angle theta. But according to the setup, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside depends only on that charge and the distance L from the center.

Wait, but in the given options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which matches this conclusion. But let me check the other options.

Option A: E = ... (l-s cosθ)^2. That seems more complicated, perhaps involving the position of the charge relative to the cavity.

Option C: ... (l + s cosθ)^2. Again, a more complicated expression.

Option D: ... l squared. So, D is treating the point as being at a distance l from the cavity's center, but that's not right because the conductor's influence is from its own charge, which is at the center.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. So the field depends on L, not on l, because the conductor's outer charge is what's creating the field outside. So the field at P is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, regardless of where inside the cavity the +q is placed.

Wait, but in reality, the field outside a spherical shell doesn't depend on where the charge is inside the shell. So if the charge is placed anywhere inside the cavity, the outer surface will arrange such that the external field is as if all the charge were at the center.

So then, the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

But wait, what's the reasoning here? Because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and the point P is outside, so the field is as if it's a point charge at the center. So yes, option B is correct.

Wait, but why are the other options even presented? Let's think. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²), which would be the case if the field were due to the charge in the cavity, without considering the conductor. But that's not the case because the conductor's outer surface charge is what's creating the field outside.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (closest to the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.  
   - To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.  
   - Since the outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (outside the conductor) will be as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.  
   - The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$, so the electric field is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

3. **Irrelevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   - The position of the cavity (and hence the charge $+q$ inside it) relative to the conductor's center does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface charge ensures that the electric field outside is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves a complicated expression with $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$. This is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not on the cavity's geometry or the angle $\theta$.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$. This is correct.  
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$. This is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Treats the field as if it were due to the charge $+q$ at a distance $l$ from the cavity's center. This is incorrect because the field outside the conductor is determined by the outer surface charge, not the cavity's position.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
