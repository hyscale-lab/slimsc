Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each listing different combinations.

First, what do I know about these symmetries? Let's go through each one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning all the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. In SMEFT, all operators must respect this, right? Because the Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that extends the SM. So any operator not respecting Lorentz symmetry would probably break the theory's consistency, especially since SMEFT is constructed by adding terms that preserve the SM's symmetries.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry (like space and time translations)? So if the theory respects Poincare, it must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But the SMEFT operators are built from SM fields, which already respect these, so I think SMEFT operators must preserve Poincare. But wait, the question is about what each operator must respect. Do the individual operators have to be invariant under Poincare, or is it the whole theory?

Wait, operators in the SMEFT are local, so each operator would respect Lorentz symmetry if SMEFT does. But Poincare includes not just Lorentz but also momentum conservation. Hmm, but maybe each operator is constructed as a Lorentz invariant operator. So for each operator, Lorentz symmetry must be respected, but Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry—so if the operator itself is Lorentz invariant, then under Poincare transformations, which include translations, the operator would also be invariant if the theory respects momentum conservation.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The operators in SMEFT are written in terms of the SM fields, which are already Poincare-invariant. So each operator would be a Poincare-invariant operator. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. But I'm not sure if the question considers Poincare as separate from Lorentz. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structure. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar, which means Lorentz symmetry is definitely required. But Poincare includes translations as well. Do the operators themselves have to be invariant under translations? Or is that a global symmetry of the entire action?

Wait, operators like the kinetic term are part of the action, which is invariant under translations because the Lagrangian is. So each individual operator in the Lagrangian should be translation invariant as well. So operators in the SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, meaning Poincare symmetry is also required.

Wait, but the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as options 1 and 2. So if both are required, then both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain about this. Let me think again. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translations. Since the action in SMEFT is Poincare-invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. So yes, each operator must be a Poincare scalar, so both Lorentz and translation symmetries are respected. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but if the entire action is Poincare-invariant, then each term in the Lagrangian must be as well. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. So options 1 and 2 are both needed.

So that would mean the answer includes both 1 and 2.

Now, what about the other options: 3. CP symmetry and 4. CPT symmetry.

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry because the SM doesn't always do that. For example, the SM has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP, then operators don't have to respect CP. So option 3 may not be a required symmetry.

CPT symmetry, on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Hamiltonian is symmetric under CPT. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant (which we've established SMEFT is), then it must respect CPT symmetry. So for all operators, their form must be such that the overall theory respects CPT.

Wait, but the operators themselves must respect CPT symmetry? Or is it the theory as a whole? Because each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is part of the theory. So if the Lagrangian is CPT-invariant, then each term must be as well. Because if a term violates CPT, then the whole theory would. So I think operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So, putting this together:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Must be respected.

3. CP Symmetry: Not necessarily; SMEFT can include operators that break CP.

4. CPT Symmetry: Must be respected.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So according to this, the correct answer would include 1,2, and 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that each operator must be a Poincare scalar, so 1 and 2 must be correct. Also, 4 must be correct. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So in that case, would the answer include Poincare but not Lorentz? Or does the question treat Lorentz and Poincare as separate?

Because the question lists them as two separate options, so perhaps I should evaluate them separately. Let me think again. Since the SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, so 1 is correct. Also, Poincare is a larger symmetry, so the operators must also be Poincare scalars, so 2 is correct. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So the correct options are 1,2, and 4. So option C is 1,2,4, which matches.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry is fundamental to special relativity and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT must therefore be a Lorentz scalar.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and its operators are constructed from SM fields, which already respect translational symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, the SM already contains sources of CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that break CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily required for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The CPT theorem ensures that in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Hamiltonian is symmetric under CPT. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

Based on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz Symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré Symmetry (2)**, and **CPT Symmetry (4)**. The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
