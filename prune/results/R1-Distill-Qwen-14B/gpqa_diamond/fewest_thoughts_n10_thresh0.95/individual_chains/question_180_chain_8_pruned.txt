Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But no worries, I'll take it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Wait, so the setup is that one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. Since they're identical charges, they'll all repel each other. But since they're constrained to stay at 2m, their positions are fixed relative to P. Hmm, but wait, are the 12 charges all at the same point 2 meters away from P, or are they arranged in some other way? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, so I think they are all at the same distance from P, but perhaps arranged spherically or something. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe their exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're dealing with each pair's contribution.

Oh wait, no. The potential energy of a system of charges depends on the configuration. But the problem says it's an isolated system, so we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but how many pairs are there? There are 13 charges, so the number of unique pairs would be C(13,2) = (13*12)/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, each pair contributes a certain term, either positive or negative. But wait, all charges are positive since each is 2e, and e is positive. So each pair contributes a positive potential energy because like charges repel, and their potential energy is positive.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Since both q1 and q2 are 2e, their product is positive. So each pair contributes a positive U, meaning the total potential energy will be the sum of all these positive terms. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So if all the other charges are fixed in place, how does the system's energy change?

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each fixed at 2m from P. So all the charges are fixed in their positions relative to each other. So the system's potential energy is fixed too. Hmm, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the system as a collection of charges where the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each 2m from P. So each of these 12 is a distance of 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Because if they are all at 2m from P, their mutual distances could vary, but the problem says they are constrained. So perhaps the problem assumes that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of exactly 2m from P, but nothing is said about their mutual distances. Oh, but if we're to find the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are as far apart as possible, but wait noâ€”because all charges are positive, the potential energy between them is positive, so to minimize the total energy (which is the sum of all these positive terms), we need to arrange the charges in such a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So it's possible that their arrangement is such that each is 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But if we're to find the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the total potential energy would be when the mutual distances between the 12 charges are as large as possible. Alternatively, perhaps when all the 12 charges are placed as far apart as possible, but that's not possible if they're all at 2m from P. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the 12 charges as being placed at the same point 2m from P, but that can't be right because then the mutual distances would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2m from P, and their mutual distances are optimized to minimize the total potential energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplifying things. Maybe each of the 12 charges is 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the charge at P. So the potential energy between each of these 12 charges and the charge at P would be
