Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's start by recalling what factors affect the transit probability.

Wait, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. Oh right, the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But how do we calculate that from the given data?

I remember the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_star + R_planet)² / (a² * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a². But wait, Earth-like planets probably have R_planet much smaller than R_star, so maybe R_planet can be neglected? Or should I include it?

Alternatively, I've heard another approach where the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), squared. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, maybe the chance that the inclination is right. Oh wait, the exact formula might be (R_* / a) * (something), but more accurately, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - (R_* + R_p)/a)) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Specifically, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) / (something else). Let me think again.

Oh right, the transit probability for a planet is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a) * (1 / (1 - (R_star + R_planet)/a ))). But that seems a bit complicated. Wait, another source I remember says that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) when a > R_star, which is usually the case. So the probability P is proportional to (R_*/a), because when the star is much larger than the planet, R_planet is negligible. So I can approximate P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, no—wait, the transit probability is actually (R_* + R_p) / a multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is (R_* / a) divided by (1 - (R_* / a)), but that might be for a different context. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me try to get the formula right. I think the transit probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - sqrt( (R_* + R_p)/a )) ) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, if the semi-major axis a is much larger than R_*, then this simplifies. But in our case, since both planets are Earth-like, a is likely much larger than R_*.

Wait, another approach—since both planets are around stars with the same radius (the question says both host stars have the same radii), the R_* is the same for both. So the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis a: higher a, lower probability. So for two planets around stars with same R, the one with smaller a has higher probability.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / a multiplied by some function, but perhaps for our purposes, since R_* is the same for both, and R_p is similar (both Earth-like), the dominant factor is a. So the planet with a smaller a would have a higher probability of transiting because a is in the denominator.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say P is proportional to (R_*/a). So if a is smaller, P is larger. So if Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2, but same R_*, then Planet_1's a is smaller. So transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, the period is related to a via Kepler's third law. Since the host stars have different masses, their a would be different.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) = (G(M_* + M_p) * P^2) / (4π²). Since the planets are Earth-like, their
