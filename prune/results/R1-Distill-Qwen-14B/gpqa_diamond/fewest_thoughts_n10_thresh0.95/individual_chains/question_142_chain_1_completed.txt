Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through step by step.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Right, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So a pure state would have a density matrix of |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this seems different.

Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The density matrix here is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. Oh, right, that's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix.

I think each basis state |0⟩ and |1⟩ contribute equally because of the 1/2 factor. So each has a probability of 1/2. That sounds like a completely mixed state in a qubit. Because if a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's the same as being in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with 50% probability.

Wait, but how does this relate to the geometrical position in the qubit space? I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector r describes the state, where for a density matrix ρ, r is calculated as something like Tr(ρ σ) where σ are the Pauli matrices, or wait, maybe it's 2ρ- I?

Wait, the general formula for the density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is: 

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I have ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, that's the same as (I)/2. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix for 2x2. So ρ = I/2.

So then, plugging into the formula, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. Which means that r must be the zero vector. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, right? Because the origin in the Bloch sphere is the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way to compute r is using the formula r = [ Tr(ρ X), Tr(ρ Y), Tr(ρ Z) ] where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Let's compute each component.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Compute Tr(ρ X). ρ is (1/2) I, so Tr( (I/2) * X )= (1/2)*Tr(X). But Tr(X) is 0 because it's [[0,1],[1,0]]: 0+0=0. So Tr(ρ X)=0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ Y)=0. And Tr(ρ Z)= (1/2)*Tr(Z). Tr(Z) is 1 + (-1) =0. So all components are zero. So r=(0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state of a qubit, where the system is in an equal probability mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

To determine the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(r\) for a density matrix \(\rho\) is related to \(\rho\) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), we find that:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Subtracting \(I/2\) from both sides gives:

\[
0 = r \cdot \sigma.
\]

This implies that \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state.

To confirm, we can also compute \(r\) directly using the formula:

\[
r = \left( \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) \right).
\]

Since \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), we compute:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_x) = 0,
\]
\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_y) = 0,
\]
\[
\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_z) = 0.
\]

Thus, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), confirming that the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
