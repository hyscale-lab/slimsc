Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. There are some stability constants provided: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So Co(II) can form complexes with SCN^- in different stoichiometries, like [Co(SCN)]^n-, and the stability constants (β) represent the formation from the previous step.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^k+. The stability constants are for each successive addition of SCN^-.

So, the different complexes would be:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4)

Wait, does the question specify which one is the blue dithiocyanato complex? Oh, wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So n=2, so the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the question is asking for the percentage of this species relative to all Co species.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution. Since all the species are Co-containing, I can just find the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2] to the total of all species.

But how to compute this? I think it's a problem involving the distribution of metal complexes based on their stability constants. The approach would involve calculating the concentration of each complex relative to the free ion, and then summing them up for the total.

I remember that for such a distribution, the fraction of each complex can be found using the stepwise formation constants. Each βn is the formation constant for adding the nth SCN^- to the (n-1)th complex. So, the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of all β's up to that n.

Wait, no. Wait, the way stability constants work is that βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^(n-1) + SCN^- ↔ Co^n. So, for example, β1 is the constant for Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+.

Then, β2 is for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

So the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN^- ligands would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. But wait, that's not quite right. Because each β is the constant for adding one more SCN.

Wait, actually, the general approach is that the formation constants are cumulative. So K1 = β1, K2 = β1*β2, K3 = β1*β2*β3, etc. Wait, no, that's if β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc. So each βn is the step from n-1 to n ligands.

Wait, let me think: For a metal ion M, the formation of complexes with ligand L can be considered stepwise. If the species are ML^m, ML2^(m-1), etc., then the stepwise formation constants would be K1 = [ML]/([M][L]), K2 = [ML2]/([ML][L]), etc. So overall, [ML2] = K1*K2 [M][L]^2.

So the overall formation constant for the second complex (with two ligands) would be K1*K2 = β1*β2.

So, the complexes' concentrations can be expressed in terms of the free Co²+ and the total ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of a particular complex is (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [L]^n / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n ), where [L] is the concentration of the ligand.

Wait, but in this case, the ligand is SCN^- and the concentration is given as 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species should add up to c(Co) = 1e-2 M, because each complex is a form of Co.

So, let's denote the concentration of free Co²+ as [Co²+], and then the concentrations of each complex are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each of these can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] and the respective formation constants and [SCN^-].

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, then sum them to find the total, and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato (n=2) species.

But calculating all that might get complicated. Let me think about how to model it.

The fraction of the nth complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN^-]^m )) )

Because for the free ion (m=0), the term is 1, for m=1 it's β1 [L], for m=2 it's β1 β2 [L]^2, etc.

Wait, but wait. [Co] is the sum of all the species. So [Co] = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Which can be written as:

[Co] = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

So, [Co²+] = [Co] / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Then, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is [Co²+] * β1 β2 [L]^2.

So, the fraction f2 is ([Co²+] * β1 β2 [L]^2 ) / [Co].

Substituting [Co²+] from above, f2 = ( β1 β2 [L]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

So that's the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

c(Co) = 1e-2 M, but [Co] in the denominator is the sum, but since [Co] is given as 1e-2, perhaps I can proceed with [Co] as 1e-2.

Wait, but no, [Co] is the total concentration, so [Co] = [Co²+] + sum of complexes.

In any case, for the fraction, [Co] is given as 1e-2, but in the expression for f2, it's normalized.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, compute each term in the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[L] = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term:

Term 0 (m=0): 1.

Term 1 (m=1): β1 * [L] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

Term 2 (m=2): β1 β2 * [L]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3 (m=3): β1 β2 β3 * [L]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

Let's compute that: 9*40 is 360, 360 *63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Wait, wait, no: [L]^3 is (0.1)^3=0.001. So 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680.

Then 22680 * 0.001=22.68. So term3 is 22.68.

Term4 (m=4): β1 β2 β3 β4 * [L]^4.

Compute β1 β2 β3 β4: 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

[L]^4 = (0.1)^4 =0.0001.

So term4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Wait, wait, 362880 * 1e-4 is 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, no, 362880 * 0.0001 is 36.288. Yes.

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me sum them up.

1 +0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6 =5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

The numerator for f2 is term2, which is 3.6.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05559.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 64.468. Let me compute that.

64.468 divided by 3.6.

Wait, 3.6 * 18 =64.8. So 3.6 is about 18 times 0.2, but wait, wait, I'm trying to compute 3.6 /64.468.

3.6 /64.468 = approximately 0.05559.

So 5.559%? But wait, wait, that's only 5.5%, but the options don't have anything that low except D) 16.9%, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me double-check the terms.

Wait, term1: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9. Correct.

Term2: β1 β2 [L]^2: 9*40=360; 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6. Correct.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3: 9 *40=360, *63=22680; 22680 * 0.001=22.68. Correct.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4: 22680 *16 =362880; 362880 * 0.0001=36.288. Correct.

So denominator is 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

Wait, so denominator is 64.468.

Wait, but the numerator for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2 * [L]^2. So the term is 3.6.

So fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05559, about 5.56%.

But the options don't have that. The options are 16.9, 25.6, 38.1, 42.3.

So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the stability constants. Maybe β1 is for [Co(SCN)_1]^+; β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 over [Co(SCN)_1]^+ [SCN^-], etc.

But in any case, the formula I used for f2 is correct, right? Because the fraction is the term for m=2, which is β1 β2 [L]^2, divided by the sum.

Wait, wait, but maybe the formula should include the [Co] as well. Wait, no, I think the formula is set up correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, wait. Another approach. Let's compute the ratio for each complex.

The fraction for each complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n ) / denominator, where denominator is sum for m=0 to 4 of (β1...βm [L]^m )

So for n=2, it's (β1 β2 [L]^2) / (sum for m=0 to 4... )

Which is what I did.

So according to my calculation, the fraction is about 5.56%. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me re-calculate the denominator.

Term0: 1.

Term1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9. Sum so far:1.9.

Term2: 9*40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6. Sum:5.5.

Term3: 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Wait, 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680. 22680 * (0.001)=22.68. Sum:5.5+22.68=28.18.

Term4:9*40*63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. 362880 * (0.0001)=36.288. Sum:28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So numerator for n=2 is 3.6. So 3.6 /64.468 is indeed about 0.05559 (5.56%).

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, think again. The "dithiocyanato" complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^{0}, which is the second complex. But perhaps the question is referring to a different complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given as overall formation constants, not stepwise. But the question states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, stability constants are typically overall, not stepwise. So perhaps β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. Wait no, that can't be, because the overall formation constant would be larger for each subsequent complex.

Wait, no. Let me think: the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^k+ is [complex]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n).

So if we have the stepwise formation constants, each βn is [Co(L)_n]/([Co(L)_{n-1}}][L]}.

So, the overall K for [Co(L)_n] is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, in that case, the denominator would be sum of [Co(L)_n] = sum_{n=0 to 4} K_n [L]^n, but K_n is the overall.

Wait, no, the denominator would be sum_{n=0}^4 [Co(L)_n] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}.

Each [Co(L)_n] can be written as K_n [Co^2+][L]^n.

So, [Co] = [Co^2+] (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 ), where K1=β1, K2=β1β2, K3=β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

So, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is (K2 [L]^2) / (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )

Which is exactly what I did before.

So in that case, my calculation is correct, and the fraction is about 5.56%, but the options don't have this. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the K for the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

Wait, K2 = β1 * β2.

With β1=9 and β2=40, K2=9*40=360.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 = 360 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

But when I compute the fraction, which is (K2 [L]^2) / denominator, which is (360*(0.1)^2) / sum.

Wait, sum is 1 + (9 *0.1) + (360 *0.1^2) + (9*40*63 *0.1^3) + (9*40*63*16 *0.1^4).

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the term3 and term4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute the sum again, being precise.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 * [L] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [L]^2 =9 *40 *0.1^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3=9 *40 *63 *0.1^3= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4=9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So the fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05559 or 5.559%.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is referring to a different complex. Wait, the question says 'blue dithiocyanato' which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe the given β's are the overall constants, not stepwise. So, β1 is [CoSCN^+]/
