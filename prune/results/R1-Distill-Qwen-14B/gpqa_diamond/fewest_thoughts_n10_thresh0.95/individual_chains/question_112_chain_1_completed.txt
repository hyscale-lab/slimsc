Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it again. Alright, the problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Let's break it down step by step.

The state given is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first thing I need to do is normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, not normalized.

To normalize, I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then divide each component by the square root of that. Let's see. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). So, the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Because when you take the inner product, you multiply each term by its complex conjugate.

Calculating each part: (1+i)(1-i) is 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. And (2 - i)(2 + i) is (4 + 2i - 2i -i²) which is 4 - (-1) = 5. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, (2 - i)(2 + i) is (2)^2 - (i)^2. Because (a-b)(a+b)=a² - b². So 4 - (i^2) which is 4 - (-1)=5. Right.

So the inner product is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, since it's a 2x2 matrix in spin space (since we're dealing with up and down), the matrix would be:

A = [ [ 0, hbar/2 ],
       [ hbar/2, 0 ] ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the matrices are usually in the basis of the eigenstates. So for the spin z-projection, the basis is |up> and |down>. So the operator A is represented by this matrix.

But what does this operator represent? It looks like a spin-flipping operator, maybe σx scaled by hbar/2. Because σx has ones in the off-diagonal and zeros on the diagonal. So yes, A is (σx)(hbar/2).

The eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σx. Oh wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So we need to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σx, its eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to diagonalize the matrix A. Let me think. Because the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σx.

But let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, it's manageable.

The matrix A is:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2, λ_- = -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I)|v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which gives the equation (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the equations would give v2 = -v1, so the vector is (1, -1).

But these vectors are not normalized. So the eigenvectors are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, because the eigenstates for σx (which is A scaled) are these. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σx, just scaled by a factor. So yes, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> as above.

But wait, when I computed the eigenvectors, I found vectors (1,1) and (1,-1), which are |+x> and |−x> scaled by sqrt(2). So, yes, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, but the question is about expressing it in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

First, compute the coefficients for |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

So,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But |alpha> is also (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(7) and sqrt(2):

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(7/2)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(7/2)

Wait, no, let me correct that. Let me write the equations:

( a + b ) = (1 + i) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) )
( a - b ) = (2 - i) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) )

Wait, no, let me see. From the above:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7 )

Similarly, a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7 )

So, adding and subtracting these equations:

Adding:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 ) → 2a = (3) * sqrt(2/7 )

So a = 3/2 * sqrt(2/7 ) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) → sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), sqrt(7) is sqrt(7). Let me compute that as (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(14)) / 14? Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7. So 3/2 * sqrt(14)/7 = 3 sqrt(14) /14.

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

(a + b) - (a - b) = 2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Simplify the bracket: (1 - 2) + (i + i) → (-1) + 2i → -(1) + 2i.

So 2b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 )

So b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 ) / 2 → (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, but perhaps it's better to just compute the modulus squared of a and b to get the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A. Because the probability is |<e|alpha>|² where e is an eigenstate.

So, let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

This becomes [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(7) → (3) / sqrt(7)

So, < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) ) → 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, the inner product squared is |3/sqrt(14)|² =9/14.

Wait, but wait. Let me do it step by step.

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2))
= [ (3) / sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2))
= 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is (3)^2 / (14) ) =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (1 + i - 2 + i ) / sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2))
= [ (-1 + 2i) ) / sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2))
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is | (-1 + 2i) |² / (14) → (1^2 + 2^2) =1+4=5 →5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, in the < -x | alpha >, the |down> term has a coefficient of (2 -i)/sqrt(7), and in the inner product, it's multiplied by (-1), because |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it correctly:

< -x | alpha > = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2) ) * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So, the terms are:

(1 + i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * <up|up> → (1+i)/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)).

And (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2) * <down|down> → -(2 - i)/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)).

So adding these:

(1 + i - 2 + i ) / (sqrt(14)) → (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 →5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but the probabilities should add to 1. 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. So that's close.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is represented by the matrix we have, and |alpha> is our state, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So maybe we can compute it more easily.

Let me compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this as ( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) * A * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Wait, A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So when we multiply A with the vector, it's ( (0 * a + hbar/2 * b ), (hbar/2 * a + 0 * b) ), where a is the first component and b the second.

So, let me write |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, A |alpha> is:

First component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2-i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2) (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Second component: (hbar/2) (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 - i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2) (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So, the row vector is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply by A|alpha>:

First term: (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
Second term: (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7)

So, add these two terms.

Compute each term:

Term1: (1 -i)(2 -i) * (hbar/2) /7
= [ (2 -i -2i +i²) ] * (hbar/2) /7
i² is -1, so:
= (2 -3i -1) → (1 -3i)
So term1: (1 -3i) * (hbar/2) /7 → (hbar/14)(1 -3i)

Term2: (2 + i)(1 + i) * (hbar/2) /7
Multiply (2+i)(1+i)= 2(1)+2i +i(1) +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i
So term2: (1 +3i) (hbar/2)/7 → (hbar/14)(1 +3i)

Adding term1 and term2:

(1 -3i +1 +3i) * (hbar/14) → (2) * (hbar/14) → hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, my calculation might have a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: since A = (hbar/2) σx, and σx has expectation value in state |alpha> as <sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

The expectation value of σx is Tr( rho sigma_x ), where rho is |alpha><alpha|.

Alternatively, since sigma_x is represented by the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value <sigma_x> is ( (a*d*0) + (b*c) + (c*b) + (d*a) )? Wait, perhaps another way.

Wait, the expectation value of sigma_x is sum_{i,j} ( alpha_i^* alpha_j ) (sigma_x)_ij.

But sigma_x has 1s in the off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal.

So, <sigma_x> = (alpha_1^* alpha_2) + (alpha_2^* alpha_1 )

Because the non-zero elements are (1,2) and (2,1).

So, for |alpha> = [a, b]^T, where a=(1+i)/sqrt{7}, b=(2 -i)/sqrt{7}

So <sigma_x> = a^* b + b^* a

Compute a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So a^* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7 → (2 -i -2i + i²)/7 → (2-3i -1)/7 → (1-3i)/7

b^* a = (2 + i)(1 +i)/7 → (2(1) +2i +i(1) +i²) → (2 +3i -1)/7 → (1+3i)/7

Adding these together: (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 → (2)/7 → 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

The probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the inner products \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{2}{7} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
