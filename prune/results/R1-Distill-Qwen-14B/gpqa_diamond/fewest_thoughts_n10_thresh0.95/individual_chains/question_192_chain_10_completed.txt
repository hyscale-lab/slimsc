Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to visualize it. There's a spherical conductor with radius R, right? And inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by some distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Oh, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, both l and L are greater than R. Hmm, so P is outside the main conductor.

I remember that when charges are inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. Oh right, so the induced charges will depend on the situation. Since the conductor is neutral, any charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would rearrange. Oh, but the conductor is initially uncharged, so the net charge on the conductor must be zero.

So, when we put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out. Wait, no: if the conductor was neutral, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, so that the total conductor charge remains zero. Or wait, no: the conductor being neutral doesn't necessarily mean that. Wait, the original conductor is uncharged, so when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q (because the conductor's material will rearrange to cancel the field inside the conductor). Then, since the total charge of the conductor is zero (it was uncharged), the outer surface must have +q. Hmm, yes, that makes sense.

So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so it's outside radius R. The electric field at P would be due to the charges on the outer surface, right? Because the inner charges (the -q on the inner surface) are inside the conductor, so their field doesn't reach outside. Wait, no, the charges on the outer surface are on the outside, so their field would contribute.

But wait, the conductor has symmetry. Since the charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q, and the conductor is a sphere (or at least, the outer surface is a sphere), the electric field outside would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at point P should be similar to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Because, for a spherical charge distribution, the electric field outside is the same as that of a point charge at the center.

But wait, the cavity is not at the center. The charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is away from the center by s. So does that affect the field outside? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Because according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a conductor only depends on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor (radius L > R). The total charge enclosed is the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, as long as the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside should be the same as that of a point charge at the center.

Wait, but what if the cavity is not at the center? Does that affect the distribution of the outer surface charges? Because the inner surface has -q due to the charge inside the cavity, and the outer surface has +q. But when the cavity's position is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution is affected. Hmm, but for a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the field due to the outer surface's charges would still look like a point charge at the center because the outer surface is a sphere. Wait, no, because the conductor is uncharged, but the outer surface's charge is +q. Oh wait, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so it's symmetric. So even if the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface's induced charges would create a symmetrical distribution that ensures the field outside depends only on the total charge and not on the position of the inner charge.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the inner surface's charge is -q, but it's not uniformly distributed. It's only on the inner surface of the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. But the charge inside the cavity is off-center, so the inner surface's charge will be induced such that the field inside the conductor (which is a conductor, so E=0) is maintained. So the inner surface's charge would be distributed in a way that the field inside the conductor cancels, but since the outer surface is a sphere, its charge distribution would be uniform. Because the conductor is a conductor, the outer surface's charges would distribute uniformly regardless of the inner surface's distribution.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, which is off-center, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q. But because the inner surface's charge is not symmetric (since the cavity's center is offset by s), the outer surface's charge distribution won't be symmetric either. Wait, no, the outer surface is a sphere, so charges there must distribute uniformly, regardless of inner asymmetry. Because the outer surface is a sphere, any charges on it would spread uniformly. Because the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface would move freely until they reach a uniform distribution. So the outer surface has +q, uniformly distributed.

Wait, but is that the case? Suppose you have a cavity that's not centered, and you charge it. The inner surface would have a non-uniform charge distribution, but the outer surface would be uniform because it's a sphere. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge would arrange uniformly, regardless of the inner arrangement. So the field outside would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) is the same as if all the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the electric field outside is the same.

So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²).

Looking at the options:

Option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²).

Options C and A involve l and s and cosθ, which suggests they're considering the position of the charge relative to the point P. But according to the reasoning, that shouldn't matter because the field outside depends only on the total charge outside (which is +q at the center).

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the charge was placed in the cavity, the field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but let me make sure. Suppose the cavity is off-center, and the charge is somewhere inside. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) has -q, and the outer surface has +q. The outer surface is a sphere, so the field outside is as if the +q is at the center. So yes, the answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**: The spherical conductor of radius $R$ has a small cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The cavity is not centered at the conductor's center but is offset by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will develop an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor will develop a charge of $+q$.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Effect of Off-Center Cavity**: Although the cavity is offset by a distance $s$, the outer surface of the conductor remains a sphere, and its charge distribution is uniform. The position of the charge inside the cavity (and the offset of the cavity) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor, which is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface.

5. **Field at Point $P$**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Since the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that of a point charge $+q$ at the center, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $l$, $s$, and $\cos\theta$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect, as it introduces $l$ and $\cos\theta$, which are not needed for the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as it assumes the field depends only on $l$, which is not the case.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
