Okay, so I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. Here, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So I need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane.

Wait, wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal structure is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) ) or something like that. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach is using the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal.

Oh right, the general formula for d_{hkl} in a crystal is derived from the structure factor, and it's given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²). Or wait, is it the other way with cosines of the angles? Maybe I got that mixed up. Alternatively, another formula I remember is using the reciprocal of the squares. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the metric tensor.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and the angles are all equal. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral systems can be simplified because all a's are equal and all angles are the same.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos α) + 2(hl \cos β) + 2(kl \cos γ) }}, but perhaps I'm confusing the angles. Wait, no, I think in the formula, α is the angle between the y and z axes, β between x and z, and γ between x and y. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula involving the dot product.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is more straightforward when considering the reciprocal space. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l) and the interplanar distance is related to the magnitude of the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) + 2(hk cos α') + 2(hl cos β') + 2(kl cos γ') where α', β', γ' are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral crystal, because a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula can be simplified. Let me think. For a cubic system, which is a special case of rhombohedral with angles 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not cubic.

Wait, in a general rhombohedral system where a = b = c = a, and α = β = γ = θ, the interplanar distance formula can be written as:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all θ. But in the formula, the cos terms might be of the angles between the reciprocal axes or the real axes. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm remembering the correct formula. Let me try to derive it. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) + 2 hk (cos γ)/(a²) + 2 hl (cos β)/(a²) + 2 kl (cos α)/(a²) ) )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = θ. So substituting, we get:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, is that right? Because if I factor a², I get 1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) ] / a². But since all angles are θ, and in a rhombohedral system, all the angles between the axes are equal. So yes, substituting cosγ = cosβ = cosα = cosθ.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. So substituting into the equation:

d = a / sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cosθ )

Which simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cosθ )

Wait, 2*(1+1+1) = 6, multiplied by cosθ. So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cosθ )

So, given that a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and θ is 30 degrees. Cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator:

3 + 6 * (0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863, because 2.863 squared is approximately 8.196.

Wait, 2.86 squared is 8.1796. 2.863^2 is (2.86)^2 + 2*(2.86)*(0.003) + (0.003)^2 ≈ 8.1796 + 0.01716 + 0.000009 ≈ 8.196769. So yeah, 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ let's compute that.

10 divided by 2.863: 2.863 × 3 = 8.589. 8.589 is less than 10. 2.863 × 3.5 is 10.0205. Oh wait, wait, 2.863 × 3.5 is 10.0205, which is just over 10. Hmm. Wait, let me do this more accurately.

Wait, 2.863 × 3.5: 2.863 * 3 is 8.589, 2.863 * 0.5 is 1.4315. So total 10.0205. So 3.5 times gives 10.0205. But I need 10/2.863 = x. So 2.863 × x = 10. So x = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494.

Wait, let me compute it with a calculator approach. Let me compute 10 divided by 2.863.

2.863 × 3 = 8.589, so 3 gives 8.589. The difference is 10 -8.589 =1.411. So how much is 1.411 / 2.863 ≈ approximately 0.493. So total is 3.493. So approximately 3.493 Angstroms?

Wait wait, no. Wait, the denominator is sqrt(8.196) which is about 2.863. So 10 / 2.863 is approximately 3.493? Wait, that can't be right because 2.863 * 3.5 is 10.0205, which is a bit more than 10. So 10 / 2.863 = approximately 3.494.

Wait, but wait, that would make the d value about 3.494 Angstroms, but the options given are all around 8-10 Angstroms.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong? Because 3.49 is way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in this case, for (111), h=k=l=1.

So let's compute the denominator again.

h² +k² +l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Then, hk
