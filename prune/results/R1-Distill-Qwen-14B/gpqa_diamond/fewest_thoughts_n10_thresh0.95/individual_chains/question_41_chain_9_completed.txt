Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in physics, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, like the refractive index. Normally, when a medium is stationary, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. So I need to consider how the movement of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

I'm a bit fuzzy on how velocities add in different reference frames. Oh, right, this probably involves special relativity because we're dealing with velocities and light. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), right? But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n. So from the lab frame, how does this combine?

Wait a second, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab's perspective, the light's speed through the glass might be different than just c/n. Let me think. If the glass is moving towards the observer, then effectively, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the glass is moving towards the observer, which is in the same direction as the light's propagation. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the velocity addition formula from relativity. The speed of light in the glass in the glass's frame is u' = c/n. But in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, the observed speed u would be (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at u' in the glass's frame.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the glass is moving towards the observer (I'm assuming the observer is stationary in the lab frame), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then when the glass moves towards the observer, the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity inside the glass, but with relativistic considerations.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure about the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer, which is the lab frame. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Then, in the lab frame, moving towards the observer at velocity v, what is the observed speed of the light?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but subject to relativistic addition.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities between frames. So if in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = (c/n) in the same direction as the glass's movement, then in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v towards the lab observer), the observed speed u would be given by the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, the lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass frame. So the formula to find the velocity in the lab frame is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, let me think again. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame, towards the observer. So if I'm in the glass frame, the lab is moving at velocity -v. The light's velocity in the glass frame is u' = c/n towards the observer (same direction as the glass's movement). So when I change frames to the lab, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the light's velocity u is given by the relativistic addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. Since u' is the speed in the glass's frame, and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab, then yes, applying the formula as u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

But let's plug in u' = c/n. So:

u = (c/(n) + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator: 1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So the entire expression becomes (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Hmm, but let's factor out 1/(n) from the numerator and 1/(n c) from the denominator.

Wait, numerator: (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: (n c + v) / (n c) )

Wait, so when I divide these, it becomes:

[ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v) /n ] * [n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel in numerator and denominator:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but the denominator is (n c + v ), which is the same as (c n + v) = n c + v.

Wait, the numerator is (c + n v) * c.

So after simplification, the speed u is [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v).

But wait, is this correct? Let me check the units. All terms are in terms of velocity, so units should be consistent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which would only be the case if u equals c, but according to my calculation, it's [c (c + n v)]/(n c + v). Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 1, which would imply u = c, which can't be right because in a medium, the speed is c/n, and with the motion, perhaps it's still less than c.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The scenario is that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So perhaps the light's velocity in the lab frame is the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but adjusted relativistically.

Wait, another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's velocity in the glass is c/n towards the observer. So in the lab's frame, the light's velocity would be the sum of the velocity of the glass and the light's velocity relative to the glass. But wait, no, because velocities don't add that way in relativity. Oh, right, you must use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me restate. The velocity of the light in the lab frame is equal to the velocity of the glass (v) plus the velocity of the light in the glass's frame (u'), but divided by 1 + (v u')/c².

Wait, but wait, the velocity of the light relative to the lab is the sum of the glass's velocity and the velocity of light in glass, as observed from the glass frame. So yes, the formula u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

So plugging in u' = c/n:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (v c)/(n c²) )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c)

So u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v)/(n c) ) )

Which simplifies to:

(c + n v) /n * (n c) / (n c + v) )

The n cancels, leaving (c (c + n v)) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that's the same as before. Let's write it differently:

u = [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v)

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)
B) 1
C) (1 +n v)/(n -v)
D) (1 -n v)/(n +v)

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the relative motion again.

Wait, wait, maybe I should consider what the observer sees. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the observer. So when the glass moves towards the observer (lab frame), the light's speed is higher than c/n as observed in the lab?

Wait, but wait, the speed of light can't exceed c, right? Because in any inertial frame, the speed of light is c. Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, if n is 1, then u becomes [c (c + v)]/(c + v) ) = c. That makes sense because when the medium is vacuum (n=1), the light speed is c regardless of the velocity of the medium.

Wait, but when n is greater than 1, what happens? Let me plug n=2, v=1 (assuming c=1 for units). Then u would be (1*(1 + 2*1))/(2*1 +1) )= (1*(3))/(3) )= 1. So the speed is 1, which is c. That can't be right because in a medium with n=2, the speed should be 0.5, and adding the velocity of the medium shouldn't make it go beyond c.

Wait, this suggests I must have made a mistake in my approach. Because according to my calculation, when n=2 and v=1, the observed speed is c, which is impossible.

Hmm, maybe I need to rethink this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of relativistic Doppler shift or think about it differently.

Wait another approach: the speed of light in the moving medium (glass) is determined by the refractive index as seen in the lab frame. But perhaps the refractive index itself is affected by the motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, but that's not considering the medium's motion. Wait, no, because the medium's motion affects the light's speed as observed.

Wait, but according to the principle of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But when light is moving through a medium, the medium's motion can affect the observed speed because the medium's properties (like refractive index) might change.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of a different approach.

In the glass's rest frame, the light beam is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the observer. The glass is moving at speed v towards the observer in the lab frame. So, in the lab frame, the light's speed would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Yes, that's the correct formula for velocity addition in special relativity.

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's direction is same as the glass's motion. So the velocities add as per the formula.

So, with u' = c/n, v is the velocity of the glass towards the observer.

So, u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c)

So, u = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which becomes [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel, so:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v)
Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v

Wait, but if I factor c from denominator, it's c (n + v/(c) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me write it as:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But looking at the options, none of them match this form. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong sign for v. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, perhaps v is negative. Or maybe I should consider the direction of the light.

Wait, no, in the velocity addition formula, the velocities must be in the same direction. So if the glass is moving towards the observer (v is positive in that direction), and the light is moving in the same direction, then both u' and v are positive.

But let's see what the expression reduces to. Let me compute u for a specific case. Let's assume n=1 (vacuum), and v=0.5 c.

Then, u' = c/1 = c.

u = (c + 0.5 c) / (1 + (0.5 c * c)/(1*c^2)) )

Wait, denominator: 1 + (0.5 c²)/(c²) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5

So, u = (1.5 c) / 1.5 = c. Which is correct because in vacuum, the speed is c regardless of the medium's motion.

Another test case: n=2, v=0. Then, u should be c/2.

Plugging in:

u = (c + 0) / (1 + 0) = c. Wait, that's not right. Oh, wait, no: if v=0, the glass is stationary, so u should be c/n = c/2.

But according to the formula I derived earlier, when v=0, u = [c (c + 0)]/(n c +0 ) = c²/(n c) ) = c/(n). Which is correct.

Wait, so when n=2, v=0, u = c/2 as expected.

Wait, but earlier when I tried n=2 and v=1 (assuming c=1), I got u=1, which is c. But that's not correct because if the glass is moving at v=1 (equal to c) when n=2, it's impossible because you can't have v=c, but perhaps the formula works only when v is much less than c.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering non-relativistic speeds, so v is much smaller than c. Let's see what the formula approximates to when v is much less than c.

In that case, we can approximate the formula using a Taylor expansion. Let me think.

In the denominator, 1 + (v c)/(n c^2) ) = 1 + v/(n c) ≈ 1 + (v)/(n c)

So, denominator ≈ 1.

So, u ≈ (c/n + v) / 1 = c/n + v.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, the speed of light in the medium plus the medium's speed would be the observed speed. So, in glass moving at v, the light's speed would be approximately (c/n) + v.

Looking at the options, which one approximates to c/n + v when v is much smaller than c and 1/n is considered.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v) → For small v, this is approximately (1 +n v)/(n) → 1/n + v.

Which is same as (c/n) (since c=1) plus v. So that's the same as our approximation.

So option A would give u ≈ 1/n + v, which matches what we expect in the non-relativistic limit.

So that suggests that the correct formula is option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v).

But wait, earlier when I did the full relativistic calculation, I ended up with [c (c +n v)]/(n c +v), which, when c=1, becomes (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that matches option A.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I didn't realize that when I factor out c from the numerator and denominator, it simplifies to option A.

Wait, let me re-express the earlier formula:

u = [c (c +n v)]/(n c +v )

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

u = [c +n v] / [n + v/c ]

Wait, but with c=1, this becomes (1 +n v)/(n + v).

Which is option A.

So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought my calculation for n=2, v=1 (with c=1) would give u=1, but according to option A, when n=2, v=1,

u = (1 + 2*1)/(2 +1) )= 3/3 =1, which is correct because when n=2 and v=1 (same as c=1), the observed speed is 1, which is c, as expected. That makes sense because when the medium is moving at speed v approaching the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, the observed speed shouldn't exceed c.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \(v\) towards the observer, and the light beam propagates through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \(u' = \frac{c}{n}\), where \(n\) is the refractive index of the glass.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

we substitute \(u' = \frac{c}{n}\) and simplify:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Canceling \(n\) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{c (c + n v)}{n c + v}
\]

Since \(c = 1\) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider the non-relativistic limit (\(v \ll c\)):

\[
u \approx \frac{1}{n} + v
\]

which is consistent with the expected result: the speed of light in the medium plus the velocity of the medium.

Testing specific cases confirms the correctness of the formula. For example, if \(n = 1\) (vacuum), the speed of light is always \(c\), and if \(v = 0\), the speed of light in the medium is \(\frac{c}{n}\). Both cases align with the derived formula.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
