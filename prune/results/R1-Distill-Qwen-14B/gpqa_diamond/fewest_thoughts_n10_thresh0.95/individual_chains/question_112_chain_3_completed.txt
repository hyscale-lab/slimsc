Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to correct them as I go.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. The state is proportional, but I guess we can normalize it later.

The question asks us to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, what would that look like? Let me think. If i is not equal to j, then A_ij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero. So the matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0   ]

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix is given by A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j. So, for a two-level system, it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:

0     hbar/2
hbar/2 0

Wait, but that's a symmetric matrix. So the operator represented by this matrix must be a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements hbar/2. Let me think about what kind of operator that is.

Wait, in spin systems, the Pauli matrices often have off-diagonal elements. The Pauli X matrix, for instance, is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if I multiply that by hbar/2, I get [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. So this operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. 

So the operator A has eigenvalues corresponding to the Pauli X. The eigenvalues of Pauli X are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. 

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix. Because if you have an operator that's a scalar multiple of another operator, their eigenvectors are the same. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are the |+x> and |-x> states. 

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates of A. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the state |alpha>.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in the z-basis, so I think I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are the x-basis states. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix elements to compute the probabilities. Alternatively, I can diagonalize the operator A and express |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates.

Alternatively, another approach: since A is proportional to X, the observable is along the x-axis. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So first, I should normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Because the inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (1+i)(2-i) ? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, |alpha> is (a)|up> + (b)|down>, so the inner product is a* b* plus b a*, but wait, no, sorry: |alpha> is a linear combination of orthonormal states, so the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2, where a is the coefficient for |up>, and b for |down>... Oh wait, no, because <up|down> is zero, so <alpha|alpha> is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So for |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, a is (1+i), b is (2 - i). So |a|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, and |b|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says the state is proportional to that, so the actual state is that normalized version. So |alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down>, but normalized. So I'll proceed with the normalized version.

Now, the next part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A (the operator with matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]).

Wait, but A's eigenstates are the x-basis states, which are |+x> and |-x>. I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the operator A is (hbar/2) * X, where X is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2 (which is the eigenvalue of A corresponding to |+x>), I need to compute the overlap between |alpha> and |+x>, square its magnitude, and that will be the probability.

Similarly for |-x> and eigenvalue -hbar/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and find the coefficients, then square their magnitudes for probabilities.

So let's proceed. Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7). So,

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me compute the coefficients for |+x> and |-x>.

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:

= [ 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>) ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Now, expand inside the brackets:

= [ 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))|-x> ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify each coefficient:

For |+x> :

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0 = 3.

For |-x> :

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 + i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [ 1/sqrt(2) (3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x>) ] / sqrt(7)

Which simplifies to:

= [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

So the coefficients are:

c1 = 3 / sqrt(14)
c2 = (-1 + 2i)/ sqrt(14)

The probability of measuring |+x> is |c1|^2, and for |-x> it's |c2|^2.

Calculate |c1|^2: (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Calculate |c2|^2: |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (14) = (1^2 + 2^2) ) /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.357143.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but looking at the options, the probabilities are given as two numbers, like 0.64 and 0.36, etc.

Hmm, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643 → 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is about 0.357 → 0.36 when rounded.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, let me make sure. Are these the correct probabilities?

Wait, another approach: the operator A is diagonal in the x-basis, so when you measure A, you get ±hbar/2 with probabilities |c1|^2 and |c2|^2, respectively.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which are close enough if we round to two decimal places.

But let me check the other options. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which don't match. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which is opposite. Option B has 0.54 and 0.46, which don't match. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which match the approximations.

But let me think about the average value of the operator. The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is diagonal in the x-basis, and |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the average would be |c1|^2*(hbar/2) + |c2|^2*(-hbar/2).

Wait, no. Because when you measure in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

So, eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [9/14 -5/14 ] * (hbar/2) ) = (4/14) * (hbar/2) )= (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (2/7 * 1/2) ) hbar = (1/7) hbar.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14 ≈0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36 as in option A. The average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recompute the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps a different approach would help confirm.

Another method to compute the average value: since A is a 2x2 matrix, and |alpha> is a normalized state, compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], and |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So |alpha> = [a; b] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <A> is a^* b (hbar/2) + b^* a (hbar/2).

Because when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>, you have a^* * (hbar/2)*b + b^* * (hbar/2)*a.

So, compute a^* b and b^* a.

Compute a^* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)
Compute b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
a^* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) /7.

Multiply numerator:
(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so:

2 - 3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b^* a = (2 + i)(1 + i)/7.

Multiply numerator:
(2)(1) + (2)(i) + (i)(1) + (i)(i) = 2 + 2i +i +i^2.

i^2 is -1.

So 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So b^* a = (1+3i)/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) [ (1 -3i)/7 + (1 +3i)/7 ] = (hbar/2) [ (2)/7 ] = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

Which matches our previous result.

So the average value is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357, so 0.36 when rounded.

Looking at option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. That's the right match.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated for the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are the \( x \)-basis states:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( x \)-basis
Substitute \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle).
\]
Simplify:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right)|+x\rangle + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right)|-x\rangle \right].
\]
Compute the coefficients:
\[
(1+i) + (2-i) = 3, \quad (1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i.
\]
Thus:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} |+x\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} |-x\rangle.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
P(|+x\rangle) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-x\rangle) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|+x\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|-x\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
