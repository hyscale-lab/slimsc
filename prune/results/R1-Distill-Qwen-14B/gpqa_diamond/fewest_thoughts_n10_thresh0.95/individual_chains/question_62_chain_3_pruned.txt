--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to find the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a methyl group. That methyl group is connected to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and another cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the main cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO). So, the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that branches into two parts: one is a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) connected to another cyclohexane, and the other is a carbonyl group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached as CH2-C≡CH). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

I need to find the right reagents to convert this into the target molecule. Let me think about the possible reactions and reagents involved.

Looking at the options, all the sequences involve several steps. Let me try to outline what each step might be doing.

The target has an aldehyde group, so maybe oxidation is involved. Also, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. That suggests something like a Grignard reaction or maybe an addition reaction. Also, the presence of a cyclohexyl group attached to the methyl indicates perhaps a cross-coupling or some kind of alkylation.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane to something else. One of the possible reactions is deprotonation, perhaps using a strong base like NaNH2. Sodium amide is often used to deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylides. So, step 1 might be deprotonating the triple bond to form a cyclohexyl acetylide.

2. Once I have the acetylide, what can I do next? Maybe an alkylation. Acetylides can undergo alkylation with alkyl halides. So, if I have methyl chloride, that would alkylate the acetylide. For example, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+) reacting with CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that would make a propargyl group. But looking at the target, perhaps the acetylide is used for another purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is used in a coupling reaction. Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. Maybe that's formed via a cyclopropane opening or some kind of ring expansion? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial steps are to functionalize the triple bond into something else. For example, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be an alkyne alkylation, adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or wait, the ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, so after deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being used in a different way. Let me think about the target structure again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane. And also, a CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the main steps are:

- Convert the alkyne to an aldehyde.
- Then introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

But wait, the alkyne is in ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, perhaps we need to functionalize that triple bond.

Another approach: To form a carbonyl group from a triple bond, you can oxidize the alkyne. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne gives diketones. But in this case, perhaps we need to introduce a carbonyl group, but the target has an aldehyde. Alternatively, partial hydrogenation or some other reaction.

Wait, let me think about each option. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Hmm. So step 1: NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is deprotonated to form an acetylide, then methylated. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)acetylide, which is then methylated to cyclohexylpropargyl? Not sure.

Then step 2: H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. So, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond? Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne typically would convert it to cis or trans alkene, depending on conditions. But with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a hydrogenation to cis or just a single bond? Wait, maybe it's hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane. Wait, that's usually under high pressure and with a catalyst like Lindlar's for cis, or using a poison for trans. But H2/Pd—maybe it's partial hydrogenation to cis-alkene.

Wait, maybe step 1 is alkyne alkylation: ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2- (but not sure). Then step 2 is H2/Pd—maybe hydrogenated to cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Birch reduction or something else.

Step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or for the elimination reactions. Or maybe for epoxide ring opening? Or maybe for the oxidation of an alkene to a diol? Not exactly sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like a Jones oxidation. Jones oxidation is used to oxidize alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. So maybe step 4 is oxidizing an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps step 4 is oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the complete picture here. Let me think about another option.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: Deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then methylate with ethyl chloride. Wait, no, ethyl chloride would be CH2CH3Cl. So, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) would react with ethyl chloride to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3? But that's a longer chain.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, often used for elimination reactions. Or for alkyne reductions, maybe? Or perhaps for forming Grignard reagents? Not sure.

Step 3: Ozone followed by water. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So, if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a double bond, ozone would break it.

Wait, maybe sequence is: alkynide, then alkylation, then hydrogenation to cis-alkene, then ozonolysis.

But after ozonolysis, you get carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonia. That might be for workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to form ketones or aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target molecule.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, step 1: same as option A—alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3 as a catalyst. H2/Pd is usually for hydrogenation, perhaps hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond (like CH2CH2), but maybe in this case, it's a partial hydrogenation.

Alternatively, H2/Pd might reduce the alkyne to cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S as a workup. So, ozonolysis followed by reductive workup—maybe using (CH3)2S would prevent over-oxidation, leading to aldehydes or ketones instead of breaking all the way to COOH.

Then step 4: Ba(OH)2. Which is used for oxidation, maybe of alcohols to ketones or esters.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol. Wait, nan NH2 is a strong base, but methanol is an alcohol. Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol? Or perhaps a different reaction. Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkoxylation.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the general approach.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is connected via a CH2 to another cyclohexane, which also has a CHO group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can be seen as having a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a CH2OH-cyclohexyl group, and the other is a CHO group.

Wait, no. The correct IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main chain is cyclohexane. At position 1 (assuming cyclohexane as the parent), there is a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), but that CH2 is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps it's a branching: the substituent is CH2 connected to both OH and cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main cyclohexane.

Additionally, that main cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached to it.

So, the main ring has two substituents: one is the CHO group, and the other is the CH2OH-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the name again.

The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Breaking it down:

- cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (CHO) group at position 1.
- The substituent at position 1 is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, methyl group (CH2) attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group at position 1, and at the same position, a CH2 group that is connected to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. So, position 1 of the main cyclohexane has two substituents: CHO and CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that can't be because position 1 is a single carbon. So perhaps the main substituent is a CH2 group, which has two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl. So, the main cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 connected to OH and cyclohexyl, and also a CHO group. Wait, that's not possible because each carbon can only have so many bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the name. Let me try again.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Thus, the main molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with this substituent at position 1.

So, the main molecule is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (position 1) has a CHO group and a CH2 group. The CH2 group is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane.

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can't have four bonds. So, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane, and at one position, there's a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is connected to the cyclohexane, a hydroxyl group, and another cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. At one carbon (position 1), there's a substituent: a CH2 group. That CH2 has two substituents: one is OH, and the other is a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Additionally, the main ring has a CHO group attached at position 1. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group at the same position.

Wait, that seems impossible because a carbon can't have four substituents. Unless it's a quaternary carbon, but maybe in this case, it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branching point. Like, position 1 has a CH2 group which is connected to two things: a cyclohexyl and an OH, and also the main ring and the CHO.

No, perhaps a better way is to draw it:

Main ring: cyclohexane.

Position 1 (let's say the top carbon) has two substituents:

1. A CHO group (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part).
2. A CH2 group, which is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, the CH2 is connected to the main ring, the cyclohexyl, and the OH.

So, the structure is:

cyclohexane
|
CHO
|
C(CH2OH)(cyclohexyl)

Wait, I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, the CH2 is connected to the cyclohexane, the OH, and another cyclohexane.

I think perhaps the target molecule has a main cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group. This CH2 group is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and also to the main ring and a carbonyl group.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to form this structure from ethynylcyclohexane.

Let me think about the steps needed.

First, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Perhaps I can functionalize this to form a carbonyl group.

One approach to make an aldehyde is to oxidize an alkyne. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones, but if I have a terminal alkyne, maybe I can oxidize it to a carboxylic acid, but earlier steps might be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via a different route.

Wait, another thought: The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Maybe the synthesis involves forming a ketone or aldehyde, then performing a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation to add the hydroxymethyl group.

But wait, let's think about a possible synthesis:

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane. Deprotonate to form an acetylide with NaNH2.
2. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne?
Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Alkylation would add a methyl group to the acetylide, maybe making CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that would be 1-pentyne attached to cyclohexane? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the acetylide is used in a coupling reaction, but that might not fit here.

Wait, another possibility: after forming the acetylide, perhaps I can perform a hydrogenation step to add hydrogen and form a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2CH2 attached to cyclohexane, but that would be cyclohexane with a ethyl group—maybe not directly useful.

Alternatively, H2 with a catalyst could hydrogenate the alkyne to cis-alkene or trans-alkene.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation or other reaction to form a diol.

But the target has an OH group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a cyclohexane. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, an epoxidation or another reaction could occur.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride.

Assuming ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, which deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-1-propyl chloride? Or perhaps cyclohexyl-1-propyl methyl group.

Wait, no. The acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+) would react with methyl chloride to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, that's a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Then step 2: H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the alkyne. If H2 and Pd are used, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, converting the propargyl group into a CH2CH2 group. Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne typically results in cis-alkene or full hydrogenation to alkane, depending on the catalyst and conditions.

Wait, H2 with Pd is usually for catalytic hydrogenation. For alkynes, using H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple to a cis-alkene. For full hydrogenation to an alkane, you might need a higher pressure or a different catalyst.

So, if the propargyl group is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2- (but wait, no, because the propargyl was CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, initial structure after alkylation would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, if hydrogenated, it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because the triple bond is between the two carbons. So, hydrogenation would add two H's across the triple bond, making a single bond. So, after hydrogenation, it would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, initial structure after alkylation is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would make cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. The alkyne is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexyl. After hydrogenation, it becomes CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl? No, wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) to a single bond (CH2-CH2) would require adding two H's to each carbon. So, CH3-C≡C-cyclohexyl would become CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl? No, that can't be because that would imply a three-carbon chain, whereas the starting was two carbons. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond would make the structure cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

After this step, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination or oxidation. Alternatively, it can be used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or in the Birch reduction.

Wait, but in this step, after step 2, the molecule is a straight chain alkane (if fully hydrogenated). Then, Ba(OH)2 would perhaps not have much to do. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that forms a double bond, not a single bond. Let me think again.

If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which can induce elimination. Wait, Ba(OH)2 in an acid condition might cause elimination, but it's more commonly used for oxidizing alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenated alkene is treated with Ba(OH)2, which in aqueous conditions could cause dihydroxylation, but that's usually done with OsO4.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the target structure again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group.

So, perhaps the main steps are:

1. Introduce a carbonyl group (CHO) from the alkyne.
2. Introduce the hydroxymethyl group from another alkyne or via some addition.

But how?

Another approach: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, which then undergoes a Grignard reaction to add a CH2OH group.

Wait, but the ethynyl group is at the end. So, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, oxidation of an internal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would typically give a diketone, but that's not applicable here since ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Oxidation of a terminal alkyne can give a carboxylic acid, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can stop at the aldehyde stage.

For example, using a mild oxidizing agent like O3 followed by a reductive workup. Alternatively, using Ozone, then something else.

Wait, let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. For example, R-C≡C-R' would become R-O= and R'-O= after ozonolysis and workup. But in this case, starting from ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane), ozonolysis would break the triple bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, it would produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But that doesn't fit the target since the target has a more complex structure.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via a different method. Maybe via hydration to form a ketone.

Hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone. Using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like in the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O), the alkyne can be hydrated to form a ketone.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, no. Hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Hydration would add an H to each end, making CH2-C=CH2, but that's for alkynes. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the hydration of the triple bond would add an H to each carbon, making a trans-diol, but that's for alkynes? Or perhaps I'm mixing up alkyne hydration.

Wait, another approach: the hydration of an alkyne can be done under acidic conditions with HgSO4 and H2SO4, which would protonate the triple bond and form a carbonyl. So, for a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, the hydration would form a ketone. Wait, no, because the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Hydration would convert the triple bond into a ketone, giving cyclohexylpropan-2-one? Or maybe cyclohexylacetone?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the hydration would result in the triple bond becoming a ketone. So, CH2-C≡CH → CH2-C(=O)-H. But that's a ketone. Wait, but that's for an internal alkyne. For a terminal alkyne, perhaps the hydration leads to a ketone as well, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe with HgSO4 and H2SO4, the alkyne is converted into a ketone. So, the triple bond becomes a carbonyl group, and the adjacent CH2 becomes a CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexylpropanal? No, wait. The triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, so hydration would convert it into CH2-C(=O)-H, which would be a ketone. Wait, but CH3-C(=O)-H is an aldehyde, but in this case, it's CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure after hydration would be cyclohexylpropanone? That is, cyclohexane attached to a CH2-C(=O)-CH3 group? No, wait, because the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, so the carbons are CH2-C≡C-H. After hydration, adding an H to each, but that might form CH2-C(=O)-H, which would be a ketone if the adjacent group is CH2. So, the structure would be cyclohexylpropan-2-one, I think.

But the target has an aldehyde group. So this might not directly fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the ketone, we can reduce it to an alcohol and then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

Wait, but that would require more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a different pathway. For example, using a two-step process: first, convert the alkyne into a ketone, then perform a reduction to form a secondary alcohol, then oxidize to a ketone again? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which is then epoxidized and opened to form an alcohol.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li / liquid NH3
3. O3 / (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is an alcohol. So, perhaps deprotonation of the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, then reaction with methanol to form an ether? Or maybe the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form a methyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: could this be a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the alkylating agent. But that sounds a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol (CH3OH) in a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, alkyne acetylides are strong bases and good nucleophiles. Methanol could act as an electrophile. So, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) would attack the methyl group in methanol, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide and then performing a C-Methanol coupling. But I'm not familiar with that.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent. In liquid NH3, it's often used for Birch reductions or for reducing esters, etc. Alternatively, Li in NH3 can be a source of Grignard-like reagents. Hmm.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. The (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would prevent over-oxidation. So, any double bonds would be cleaved into aldehydes or ketones.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. Not sure what this step would do.

Alternatively, let me think about each step in option D.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the ethynyl group is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an alkyne ether, like cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure about that.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this is a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings, but the starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could reduce esters or other carbonyl groups, but I don't see where that would come from.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the overall process.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → functionalize the triple bond to form a carbonyl group (CHO) via oxidation.
2. Then, perform some kind of alkylation or substitution to add the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how to add the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the main steps are:

- Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
- Then, perform a Grignard reaction to add a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

But then, how do I add the cyclohexyl group? So, maybe a cross-coupling reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from another Grignard or organometallic reagent.

Wait, another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexyl Grignard reagent is added to a carbonyl.

So, if I have a carbonyl (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), and I add a cyclohexyl Grignard, perhaps that would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

But wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde. Adding a Grignard to an aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol. So, maybe after the Grignard addition, I would have a secondary alcohol with a cyclohexyl group attached.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is then attached to the main ring. So, perhaps that's the approach.

Let me outline this:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group attached to cyclohexane).

How? Maybe via oxidation. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, that would give me 2 molecules: one would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO) and the other formaldehyde (HCHO). That's because the triple bond is between two CH2 groups and a CH group.

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would split into two parts: the cyclohexane-CH2- group would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO), and the CH3 group would become formaldehyde.

But then, how would that help in forming the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation to form a diol, which is then used for further reactions.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the target has two substituents on the main cyclohexane: a CHO group and a CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming the cyclohexane ring with both substituents.

So, perhaps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → some functionalization to introduce the CHO group.
2. Then, introduce the CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group via a substitution or addition reaction.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

- Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form an acetylide.
- Alkylate the acetylide with a cyclohexyl group to form a longer chain.
- Then, perform some reaction to introduce the OH and CHO groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is used in a Sonogashira coupling to attach another group, but that would require a halide.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms an acetylide and alkylates to make a longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidation or elimination.

But let's think through this.

After step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd → converts the triple bond to a cis double bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) to a double bond (C=C) would leave a cis-alkene.

So, the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-C=CH2? No, wait: the initial alkyne after step 1 is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexyl. Hydrogenation would make CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl? No, that's not correct. Oh wait, no: hydrogenation of the triple bond (C≡C) to a double bond (C=C) would require partial hydrogenation. So, the structure after step 2 would be CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl? No, probably CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl would come from full hydrogenation. Alternatively, if it's a cis-alkene, it would be CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl with the middle CH2 as a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure after step 2 is CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The initial alkyne is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexyl. Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add two H's across the triple bond, turning it into a cis double bond: CH3-C=CH-cyclohexyl.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, CH3-C=CH-cyclohexyl → would break into two fragments: CH3-C=O and O=C-CH-cyclohexyl. Wait, but ozonolysis of a symmetric double bond would give two identical carbonyl compounds. But in this case, the double bond is between CH3 and CH-cyclohexyl, so the ozonolysis would give formaldehyde (from CH3) and a ketone from the other side.

Wait, more accurately, ozonolysis of CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl (but as a double bond, CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl would not have a double bond. Wait, no, the structure after hydrogenation would be CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl with a double bond between the middle carbons, i.e., CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl → no, wait. After hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a double bond, so the structure is CH3-C=CH-cyclohexyl.

Ozonolysis of this would cleave between the two carbons, giving two carbonyl compounds. So, the left side is CH3, which would become HCHO (formaldehyde), and the right side is CH-cyclohexyl, which would become O=C-CH2-cyclohexyl? Or perhaps OHC-cyclohexyl.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl with a double bond would give two carbonyl compounds. For CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl, the double bond is between the first and second CH2 groups. So, the ozonolysis would cleave it into formaldehyde (from CH3) and a ketone (from CH2-cyclohexyl). So, CH3-CH2-CH2-cyclohexyl becomes formaldehyde and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of the cis-alkene would give two aldehyde groups. So, from CH3-CH2-CH2-Cyclohexyl with a double bond, ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups. But I'm getting a bit confused.

After ozonolysis, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Which is a strong base, often used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on conditions.

Wait, but in this case, after ozonolysis, if we have aldehyde groups, Ba(OH)2 might not have much to do. Unless the molecule has an alcohol group that's being oxidized.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to see which reagent sequence makes sense.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane, which also has a CHO group.

Looking at the options, the correct steps would involve:

1. Converting the alkyne into an aldehyde or ketone.
2. Introducing the hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to a cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the steps are:

a) Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.
b) Alkylation to add a methyl or ethyl group.
c) Hydrogenation to form a double bond or single bond.
d) Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
e) Introduce the hydroxymethyl group via a Grignard reaction or another method.

But I'm not exactly clear.

Looking back at the options, option D has a step with O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis, leading to aldehydes.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → form acetylide, then maybe quench with methanol to form a methyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexyl.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, this could be a way to form a Grignard reagent.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls. But with (CH3)2S, it's a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes.

4. NH4OH → aqueous ammonia, perhaps for workup or to form an amide.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is forming
