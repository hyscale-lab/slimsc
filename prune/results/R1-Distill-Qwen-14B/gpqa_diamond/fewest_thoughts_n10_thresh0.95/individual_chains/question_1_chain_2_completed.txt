Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states. The options are A to D, with different values in eV.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle and energy-time uncertainty relation. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

In this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the lifetime is related to the uncertainty in time. So each state has a certain lifetime, which would mean the uncertainty in time is about that value. But wait, the problem is about distinguishing the two states. So maybe we're looking at the energy difference between them needing to be larger than the uncertainty to be resolved.

Wait, but each state has a lifetime, so maybe the time uncertainty for each is their own lifetime. But when considering the energy difference, perhaps we use the average or something else? Or do we consider the energy uncertainty for each state and then the difference between E1 and E2 has to be larger than that?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is the energy-time uncertainty relation: ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. But wait, each state has a different lifetime. How does that play into this?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy resolution. The energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, for a state with a longer lifetime (which means a smaller uncertainty ΔE), the energy resolution is better. Because if a state has a longer lifetime, the energy measurement is more precise (since ΔE is smaller). So to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the system. But which system are we considering?

Wait, maybe the question is about the energy difference being detectable based on the lifetimes of the states. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is determined by the inverse of the time difference. Or maybe the energy difference is determined by the product of the two lifetimes or something else. Hmm.

Let me try to approach this step by step. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time. But what's the uncertainty in time here? I think the lifetime τ is related to the uncertainty in the time of the state's existence. So, for each state, the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ/(2τ).

Wait, but if we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, how do we calculate the energy difference required to distinguish them? Oh, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Wait, no. Let's think about it differently. The energy resolution is determined by the time over which the measurement is made. Suppose the measurement time is the same as the lifetimes. Or perhaps the measurement is made over a time that is a multiple of the lifetimes. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy difference as it relates to the natural linewidth or something like that. The natural linewidth in spectroscopy is related to the lifetime of the state. The linewidth ΔE is approximately ħ/(τ). So, for each state, the energy lines would have a width proportional to 1/τ. To resolve two energy levels, the difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths, perhaps.

Wait, but in spectroscopy, the resolving power depends on the instrument's time of measurement or bandwidth. But in this case, maybe the question is more straightforward. It says that the two states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2. The energy difference must be such that they can be distinguished. So, I think the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty introduced by each state's lifetime.

But wait, perhaps we need to find the minimum energy difference that can be resolved given the time measurement. The energy resolution ΔE is given by ħ divided by the measurement time. Or wait, perhaps the measurement time is the same as the lifetime of the state.

Wait, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty from each state. So, the maximum of (ħ/τ1) and (ħ/τ2), or perhaps the sum?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around; the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the numbers.

The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2=1e-8 s. So, τ2 is 10 times longer than τ1. The uncertainties in energy for each state would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

Calculating each, let's plug in the numbers. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = approx 3.29e-7 eV. Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = approx 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-calculate. Wait, 1e-9 s is τ1. So, for ΔE1: 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 eV. 6.582/2 is about 3.291, so 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 eV. Wait, because 1e-8 is larger than 1e-9, so 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 is (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 eV. So 3.291e-8 eV. So ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

So, the uncertainty in E for the first state is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for the second state, it's about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or more than the larger uncertainty?

Wait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. So when you have two states, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because otherwise, the lines might overlap.

Alternatively, in spectroscopy, the resolving power R is given by R = λ/(Δλ), but perhaps it's similar here. But I'm not exactly sure how that applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of each state. So, to resolve E1 and E2, the difference must be greater than each of their individual ΔE.

Wait, but let's think about it. If the energy difference is just a little larger than the larger ΔE, then you can distinguish them. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the system, then the signals won't overlap.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because the uncertainty from τ1 is larger, so if the difference is larger than ΔE1, which is 3.29e-7 eV, then they can be resolved. Because the uncertainty of the first state is larger than the second.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV
B) 1e-11 eV
C) 1e-4 eV
D)1e-8 eV

So, the maximum ΔE is approximately 3.29e-7 eV (from τ1=1e-9 s). So the energy difference must be greater than 3.29e-7 eV to be resolved. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e3 * 1e-7 eV. Which is way larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So option C would satisfy the condition.

But wait, that seems way too big. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-9):

6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So 3.291e-7 eV is 0.3291e-6 eV, which is 0.3291 microvolts.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 * 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.6e-23 J. Hmm, but regardless of the units, yes, 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, that's way above the uncertainty, so it can be resolved.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference so that the two states can be clearly resolved. So the larger the energy difference, the easier it is to resolve. So the minimum energy difference needed is when it's just larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the energy-time uncertainty for the measurement. Alternatively, perhaps the product of the energy difference and the time over which we measure must be greater than ħ.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general rule is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference, ΔE, should be larger than the maximum of (ħ/τ1, ħ/τ2). Because if ΔE is larger than both, then the two states can be distinguished.

So, the minimum ΔE is the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let's calculate that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) ≈ 6.582e-16 / (2*1e-9) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) ≈ 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum is 3.29e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 3.29e-7 eV to be resolved. Looking at the options, only option C is larger than this. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. Since 1e-4 is 1e3 * 1e-7, which is 1e3 times the maximum uncertainty. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 3.29e-7. So perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01e-9 eV

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 eV

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 eV.

Wait, 3.29e-7 eV is approximately 0.329e-6 eV, or 0.329 μeV (microelectron volts). Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 μeV, which is way bigger. So it's much larger than needed. So option C would certainly be enough.

But wait, maybe I should consider the least energy difference that's still resolvable. So the minimal ΔE is just above 3.29e-7 eV. But none of the options are near that. The only option that's larger than that is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7 eV, which is smaller than 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference would not be resolvable if it's 1e-8 eV.

Hmm, but wait. Another approach: The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 3.29e-7 eV. So only option C is larger than that. So the answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time. For each state, the lifetime \( \tau \) corresponds to the uncertainty in time \( \Delta t \). Thus, the energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate the energy uncertainties:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \), which is \( 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the given options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it can resolve the two states.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
