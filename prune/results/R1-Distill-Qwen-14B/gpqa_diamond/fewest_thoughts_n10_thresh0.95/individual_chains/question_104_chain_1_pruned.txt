Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. They used the RV method to detect them. So, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, right, the Doppler shift in the spectral lines is related to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. Because velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, right?

The formula I remember for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. And K is given by ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) ) * something. Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version since the planets are similar to Neptune and stars are like the Sun, so M_planet << M_star. So M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star, which is the mass of the sun.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) Hmm, but wait, I think that's not exactly right. Maybe I should look up the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

Wait, the formula is K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, assuming circular orbits, so e=0, so 1-sqrt(e²)=1. So the denominator becomes P^(1/3). So K simplifies to something like K ∝ (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3))

But wait, all the planets have the same mass (Neptune-like). The stars are the same mass (solar mass). So, M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets. So K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). Because K = constant / P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then K2 = (7/5) K1.

So since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K. So P1^(1/3) = C / K1 and P2^(1/3) = C / K2.

So the ratio of P2 to P1 would be (P2/P1) = ( (C/K2) / (C/K1) )^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me see: K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3. So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because P ∝ 1/K^3 → P2 = (K1 / K2 )^3 * P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. Wait, no, because K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So (5/7)^3 is 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of Planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's? So P2 is 0.364 * P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364. So that's about 0.36 times.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}} \), and since the planet and star masses are the same for both systems, \( K \) depends only on \( P^{1/3
