Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, so their energy has both vibrational and rotational contributions. But the problem is about the fundamental state and the next state with the lowest energy. Wait, so what's the fundamental state here? Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But wait, I think for the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but for the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's a bit different. Or maybe the question is simplified here.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. So, I think that's the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state. Now, the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. So, what's the next state? Well, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J increases). But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the first excited state, which is either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0. But which transition requires less energy?

Wait, but the problem states "to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So that would be the state with the smallest increase in energy. So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational excited state, v=1, J=0? Or the first rotational state J=1, v=0? Which one has a lower energy difference?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a state that's a combination of rotation and vibration, and the next state is the next higher energy state overall. Wait, the question is asking for the photon momentum, which is related to the energy difference between states. So the energy of the photon should be equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for the rotation-vibration model is typically v=0, J=0, I think. Because rotation and vibration contribute to the energy. So for the energy levels, the vibrational energy is quantized as (v + ½)hν, and rotational as (J(J+1)/2I)h², but I might be mixing up the formulas.

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be a combination of rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which transition requires less energy?

So I need to find the energy difference between the initial state (v=0, J=0) and the next state, which could be either v=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (rotational excitation). The lower energy transition would be the one with the smaller ΔE.

So let me calculate both possible ΔE.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1)/2I) h². So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is [ (1*2/2I) - (0) ] h² = (2/(2I)) h² = (1/I) h². Wait, I is the moment of inertia.

But wait, for diatomic molecules, the moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So I need to calculate both ΔE for vibrational and rotational transitions and see which is smaller.

Let's compute the vibrational energy difference first.

ΔE_vibrational = h ν.

ν is given as 4e14 rad/s. So h ν is Planck's constant (h = 6.626e-34 J·s) multiplied by ν.

h ν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now the rotational energy difference. First compute I.

I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass. The masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) in kg.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So Mx =20 amu = 20 *1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (20 *2 ) / (20+2) ) * 1.66e-27 kg? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 *2 ) / (22) amu.

μ = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu = (20/11) amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Now, 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approx 2.999e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605 is about 3, so 3e-27 kg.

So I = μ r².

r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters.

r = 2e-10 m.

So r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Thus, I= μ r² = 3e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Wait, but to be precise, let's compute it more accurately.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

So 40/(22) = 1.81818...

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

So I = (2.999e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.999e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m² ≈ 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

E_J = (J(J+1) )/(2I) ) (h^2) for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = (1*2)/(2I) * h².

Wait, the formula for rotational energy levels is E_J = (J (J+1) )/(2I) ) h² ?

Wait, another way: the rotational energy is (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). Hmm, perhaps I should double-check. Oh, right, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2 I)) * J (J+1).

But ħ is h/(2π), so E_J = (h² / (8 π² I)) * J (J+1).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

ΔE_rotational = E_1 - E_0 = (h² / (8 π² I)) (1*2) - 0 = (h² * 2 )/(8 π² I) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, let me compute this.

ΔE_rot = ( h² * 2 )/(8 π² I) ) = (h² )/(4 π² I ).

So plugging in the numbers.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So plugging in:

ΔE_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4 π² * 1.2e-46 )

Compute the denominator: 4 * π² ≈ 4 *9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

So 39.4784 * 1.2e-46 = 4.7374e-45.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 4.39e-67 / 4.7374e-45 ≈ approximately 9.26e-23 J.

Hmm, that's a very small energy compared to the vibrational energy.

Earlier, the vibrational energy difference was 2.65e-19 J. Which is much larger.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the rotational transition, since it's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait! No, because the rotational transition energy is 9e-23 J, and the vibrational is 2.65e-19 J, which is higher. So if you go from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=0, you'd have a lower energy transition than going to J=0, v=1.

So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy equal to the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. So the next state is either J=1, same v=0, or v=1, same J=0. Which has a lower energy difference.

So the photon's energy should match either ΔE_rot or ΔE_vib. Since ΔE_rot is smaller, that's the lower energy state.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but which requires less energy. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon should have energy matching the rotational transition.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. The vibrational energy difference is 4e14 rad/s, so hν is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

The rotational energy difference: I think I might have made an error in the calculation of I.

Wait, let me recompute I.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) * (1.66e-27 kg/amu).

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(22) amu = (40)/22 = 1.81818 amu.

So 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3e-27 kg (approx 2.999e-27 kg).

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = (2.999e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=2.999e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m².

So I ≈1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 π² I)).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So, 4 π² I =4 * (9.8696) ) *1.2e-46 ≈ 39.4784 *1.2e-46 ≈ 4.7374e-45.

ΔE_rot ≈ 4.39e-67 /4.7374e-45 ≈ 9.26e-23 J.

Which is about 9.26e-23 J.

So comparing that to ΔE_vib which is about 2.65e-19 J, the rotational change requires much less energy.

So the photon's energy must match ΔE_rot, because that's the next lowest state. So the molecule will transition via absorbing a photon whose energy is equal to ΔE_rot.

So the energy of the photon E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.26e-23 J.

But momentum p of the photon is related to energy via E = pc, where c is the speed of light. Wait, for a photon, E = hν = pc, since p = E/c.

So p = E_photon / c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.26e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.087e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, 9.26e-23 / 3e8 = 3.0866e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, let me do the calculation more accurately.

E_photon = 9.26e-23 J.

p = E / c = (9.26e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.0866e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm. My calculation gave about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns, since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I mixed up the energy levels. Maybe the model allows for simultaneous changes in both rotation and vibration. Or perhaps I'm considering the wrong transition.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the transition where both vibrational and rotational levels change. But in that case, the energy would be the sum of the differences, which would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's fundamental state is v=0, J=0, and the next state is v=1, J=0. Because in some models, the vibrational transitions are more significant, but that would depend on the selection rules. But if the selection rules allow for Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1, but the photon's energy is the sum?

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the state with the least energy increase.

But according to my previous calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have E=9.26e-23 J, p=3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, which includes both rotational and vibrational states. So the ground state is the lowest rotational state (J=0) and the lowest vibrational state (v=0). The next state would be the next higher state, which could be the first vibrational state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1). But which requires less energy?

Wait, in reality, vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational. So the vibrational transition would have higher energy than rotational.

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the rotational state, J=1, v=0.

So the photon energy is the rotational ΔE. But according to my calculation, that gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next state overall, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, not a non-rigid one. Wait, the question says non-rigid rotor model. Hmm. Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the moment of inertia changes with vibrational state. But for the purpose of calculating the energy levels, perhaps the vibrational contribution is considered separately, and the rotational energy is dependent on the bond length.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. Because in some cases, like in infrared spectroscopy, the transitions are vibrational, with rotational changes as well. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, so the vibrational transition would require higher energy than the rotational, so the rotational is the next.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator in vibration and a rigid rotor in rotation. So the total energy is the sum of the two.

But then, the energy difference to the next state could be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would be even higher.

Wait, perhaps I did the rotational energy calculation wrong. Let me redo it.

E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π).

So for J=0, E_0=0.

For J=1, E_1= (1*2 ħ² )/(2 I) ) = (2 ħ² )/(2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0 = ħ² / I.

Wait, ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 π² I)).

Which is what I had before. So same calculation applies.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational transition. Because in the case of the rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are much closer together than the vibrational ones. So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, v=1, J=0.

But that would imply a much larger energy difference, which would require a photon with higher energy.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition. So I'm confused because my calculation doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the moment of inertia being different because the model is non-rigid. Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia is variable, but perhaps in this problem it's given as fixed. The bond length R is 2 angstroms.

Wait, maybe I should compute the vibrational energy and the rotational energy and see which one is lower.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

The rotational energy difference is approximately 9.26e-23 J.

So the rotational energy is smaller, so that's the next state with the lowest energy.

Hmm, but the options don't have anything close to 3e-31 kg m/s. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule making a transition to the next higher state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1), and in that process, the rotational state increases as well. But in that case, the energy would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational differences. But that would be even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the rotational and vibrational contributions. Maybe the next state is the first rotational level, but with the vibrational level still at v=0. So the photon energy is the rotational energy difference.

But then, why isn't that matching any option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck I.

I = μ r².

μ = ( (20 amu) * (2 amu) ) / (20 + 2 amu) ) = (40 amu²) /22 amu ) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.00e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

r² =4e-20 m².

So I=3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Ok, that's correct.

Now, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) * (1*2)/(2) → Hmm, no, the formula is E_J = (J (J+1) )/(2I) * ħ².

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2 I).

So for J=0, E=0.

For J=1, E=(1*2 * ħ² )/(2I) )= (2 * ħ^2 )/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

But ħ = h/(2π) → ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 π² I )).

Which is same as before.

So calculations are correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy but the vibrational energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the molecule's transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first energy level, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the energy difference is hν.

But why would that be the 'next state with the lowest possible energy' if the rotational transition is lower? Hmm. Maybe because the rotational transitions are forbidden under certain selection rules, so the next allowed state is vibrational.

But the question didn't mention anything about selection rules. It just asks which photon momentum would cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the next state is the first vibrational state, not considering the rotational transitions. Because for many diatomic molecules, vibrational transitions require higher energy than rotational, but perhaps the rotational transitions are not considered here due to the model being non-rigid.

Wait, but in the quantum model, the molecule can have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the next state with the lowest energy would involve the smallest possible increase in energy, which would be the rotational transition.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is correct, but the problem's options are incorrect, or I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recheck the formula.

Another approach: The rotational energy is given by E_J = (J (J+1) )/(2 I) * h².

Wait, that's correct. So for J=1, E= (2)/(2I) h² = h²/(I).

Wait, but I have I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So E_J=1 = (6.626e-34)^2/(1.2e-46) / (2 pi^2) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute it step by step.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So E_J=1 = (1*2)/(2I) * h² = (2/(2*1.2e-46)) *4.39e-67.

Wait, 2/(2*1.2e-46) = 1/(1.2e-46) )= 8.333e45.

Multiply by h²: 8.333e45 *4.39e-67 = 3.66e-21 J.

Wait, that's different from earlier. Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because I think I used the wrong formula earlier. Let me clarify:

E_J = [ J (J+1) * ħ² ] / (2 I )

And since ħ = h/(2π), ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So E_J = [ J (J+1) * (h²/(4 π²)) ] / (2 I )

Simplify:

E_J = [ J (J+1) h² ] / (8 π² I )

So for J=1, E_J = [2 * h² ] / (8 π² I )

= h²/(4 π² I )

Which is the same as before.

So substituting the numbers:

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

π²=9.8696.

4 π² I =4 *9.8696 *1.2e-46 = 47.374e-46 = 4.7374e-45.

So E_J=1 = 4.39e-67 /4.7374e-45 ≈ 9.26e-23 J.

So that's correct. But why in this alternative calculation I got 3.66e-21 J? Because I think I forgot to include the 8 π² in the denominator.

Yes, because in the alternative approach I incorrectly wrote E_J= (2)/(2I) h², but I should have included the 8 π².

So the correct ΔE_rot is 9.26e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.26e-23 J.

Then, p = E/c = 9.26e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.087e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) amu → 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.66e-27 kg → 1.81818 *1.66e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=2.999e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m².

So I=1.2e-46.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute E_rot.

E_rot = [ J (J+1) * ħ² ] / (2 I )

J=1: [2 * (h/(2π))² ] / (2 I )

= 2 * (h²/(4 π²)) ) / (2 I )

Simplify numerator: 2 h²/(4 π²) = h²/(2 π²).

Denominator: 2 I.

So E_rot = [h²/(2 π²)] / (2 I ) = h²/(
