Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that the spin-z operator has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

The question is in two parts: first, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix A where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Second, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, so I think the first step is to figure out what operator A is. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we have two states, up and down), let's write out A.

A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements of ħ/2. So,

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because if i≠j, then A_ij is ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, what's the significance of this matrix? I think this matrix might correspond to the spin-x operator or something else. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by ħ/2, we get a matrix like A. So A is the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2. Or wait, the spin operator Sx might be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. Therefore, when we measure the operator A, we're effectively measuring in the spin-x basis. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, we need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>). Alternatively, we could diagonalize A and find its eigenstates, then project |alpha> onto those.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form an orthonormal basis. So we can find the eigenstates of A, write |alpha> as a linear combination of these eigenstates, and the square of the coefficients' magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Let me think about how to find the eigenstates of A. The matrix A is:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[b, a]] are a + b and a - b. Wait, no, in this case, the matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy:

det( [ [ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ] ] ) = 0

Which is (λ^2) - (ħ^2/4) = 0 → λ^2 = ħ^2/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, just like the spin-z operator. But the eigenstates are different. Let's find the eigenstates.

For λ = +ħ/2:

(A - λ I)|v> = 0 →
[ [ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ] * [a, b]^T = 0

The first equation: -ħ/2 a + ħ/2 b = 0 → -a + b = 0 → b = a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. So the eigenstate is |+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The equations would be [ ħ/2 a + ħ/2 b = 0 → a + b =0 → b = -a.

So the eigenvector is [1, -1]^T. So the eigenstate is |-x> = (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, our state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me write it as (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, but the state is given as proportional to that. So perhaps we need to normalize it first. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm squared is 2+5=7 → norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when measuring operator A, we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, |+x> and |-x>.

So let's write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- | -x >.

Now, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7),

( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Let me write these as equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → because sqrt(2) is denominator.

Equation (2): (c_+ - c_-) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, actually, let me compute:

From equation (1), (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → because (1+i)/sqrt(7) is the coefficient of |up>, and we have divided by sqrt(2) in the expression above.

Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, the coefficients are [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) → (1+i) * sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, equation (2):

c_+ - c_- = (2-i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) → (2-i) * sqrt(2/7).

Now, we have a system of two equations:

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (A),

c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (B).

We can solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations (A) and (B):

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [3] * sqrt(2/7).

So c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, subtracting equation (B) from (A):

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → [ (1 +i -2 +i ) ] → (-1 + 2i ) → sqrt(2/7) multiplied.

So 2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) → c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Wait, but that might not be necessary. What we need are the probabilities, which are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So let's compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

First, compute c_+:

c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) / (2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(7)).

Hmm, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7), so it's  (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, let me compute |c_+|^2:

|c_+|^2 = [ (3/2)^2 ] * (2/7) → (9/4) * (2/7) = (9*2)/(4*7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So |c_-|^2 is [ | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2/7) ] / (2^2) → [ (1^2 + 2^2) * (2/7) ] /4 → (5 * 2/7)/4 = (10/7)/4 = 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, that's 5/14, which is approximately 0.357. But the options don't have 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 → 0.64 + 0.36 =1. So 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, and 5/14≈0.3571.

Which is approximately 64.3% and 35.7%. So 0.64 and 0.36 are close to these, but not exact. Let me compute precisely.

9/14 is 0.642857..., which is 64.2857% → approximately 0.643.

5/14 is 0.357142... → about 0.357.

Looking at the options, Option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. So that's very close. So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36% for +x and -x.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation for |c_-|^2. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, c_- is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So |c_-|^2 is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2/7) ] / (2^2) → [ (1 +4) * 2/7 ] /4 = (5 * 2/7)/4 → (10/7)/4 = 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

So yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are about 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which matches the first part. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait but wait, let's check if I got the eigenstates right. Because sometimes the eigenstates are defined with a phase, which could affect the coefficients.

Wait, the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But sometimes, people include a phase factor, like (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but that would flip the eigenvalue. Let me think: if the operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], then when you have the state |up> - |down>, what's the eigenvalue?

Let me test A acting on |up> - |down>.

A |up> = (ħ/2) |down>, A |down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

So A (|up> - |down>) = (ħ/2)|down> - (ħ/2)|up> = -(ħ/2) (|up> - |down>).

So yes, the eigenvalue is -ħ/2 for |-x>.

So the calculation of c_+ and c_- should be correct.

Now, the second part of the question is the average value of the operator A.

The expectation value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is already normalized, we can compute this as the sum over the basis.

But perhaps it's easier to note that A is the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin-x operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. So A is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x. So the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

But |alpha> is in the spin-z basis. So perhaps it's easier to compute <A> directly using the matrix elements.

Let me write out |alpha> as a column vector. Since |up> is [1, 0]^T and |down> is [0, 1]^T, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [1;0] + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * [0;1] → [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]].

So <A> = |alpha|^† A |alpha>.

Compute this:

= [( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^*, ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute each part:

First, compute the conjugate of the components:

(1+i)^* = 1 -i.

(2 -i)^* = 2 +i.

So the conjugate vector is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, multiply this by A and the state vector.

Let me compute A * |alpha> first.

A |alpha> = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the first component is 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component is (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

So A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ; (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, the bra vector is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out (ħ/2) * (1/sqrt(7))^2 → (ħ/2) * (1/7).

So,

= (ħ/2)(1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ].

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-i-2i) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 +2i +i + (-1) → (2-1) + (2i +i) → 1 +3i.

So the sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2)(1/7) * 2 = (ħ/2)(2/7) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that can't be right because the options have hbar/sqrt(7), but I get hbar/7. Let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, let me compute the two terms again.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 - i -2i + i² → 2 -3i + (-1) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 + 2i +i + (-1) → (2-1) + (3i) → 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So the sum is 2. So expectation value is (ħ/2)(1/7)*2 → (ħ/2)*(2/7) )= ħ/7.

Hmm, so the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7, which matches.

Option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to our calculated 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571.

But option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So that would make option A correct.

Wait, but let me cross-verify the expectation value another way. Since the operator A is the spin-x operator scaled by ħ/2. The expectation value of the spin-x operator is (⟨alpha| Sx |alpha⟩ ). Since Sx = (ħ/2) σ_x, then ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨sigma_x⟩.

Wait, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has the same form as A/(ħ/2). So perhaps another approach.

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by (alpha| sigma_x |alpha).

In terms of the state vector, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, (alpha| sigma_x |alpha) is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute the matrix multiplication:

[[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] → [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the inner product is (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Multiply each term:

First term: (1-i)(2-i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2 → 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) =1, (-i-2i) =-3i → 1-3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2+2i +i -1 → (2-1)=1, (2i +i)=3i → 1+3i.

Sum these: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is 2/(7) → because each (1/sqrt(7))^2 is 1/7, and 2 * (1/7) = 2/7.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ = 2/7. Therefore, ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So that's correct. So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in the state 

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle,
\]

where \(|{\uparrow}\rangle\) and \(|{\downarrow}\rangle\) are the eigenstates of the \(z\)-component of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \(A\), whose matrix representation is 

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and to find the average value of \(A\).

### Step 1: Eigenstates of \(A\)
The eigenvalues of \(A\) are \(\pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|{+x}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Expand \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of \(|{+x}\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\)
The state \(|\alpha\rangle\) can be expressed as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_{+} |{+x}\rangle + c_{-} |-x\rangle,
\]

where \(c_{+}\) and \(c_{-}\) are coefficients determined by projecting \(|\alpha\rangle\) onto \(|{+x}\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\). Substituting the eigenstates:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{c_{+}}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle \right) + \frac{c_{-}}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle \right).
\]

Equating coefficients of \(|{\uparrow}\rangle\) and \(|{\downarrow}\rangle\) with those in \(|\alpha\rangle\), we solve for \(c_{+}\) and \(c_{-}\):

\[
c_{+} + c_{-} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_{+} - c_{-} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations gives:

\[
c_{+} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}, \quad c_{-} = \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\) are \(|c_{+}|^2\) and \(|c_{-}|^2\), respectively:

\[
|c_{+}|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_{-}|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\).

### Step 3: Average value of \(A\)
The expectation value of \(A\) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \(|\alpha\rangle\) as a column vector and \(A\) as a matrix, the calculation yields:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\) are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), respectively, and the average value of \(A\) is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
