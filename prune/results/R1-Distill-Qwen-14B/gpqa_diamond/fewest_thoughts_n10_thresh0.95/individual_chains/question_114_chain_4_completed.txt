Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I'll try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving different choices for A and B.

Alright, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product structure here... Wait, but wait, let me write the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, it's probably undergoing a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones can undergo various reactions with CN-. Oh, right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H+ or something, the ketone can react with cyanide. 

Wait, but I think the reaction of ketones with HCN (or CN-) usually gives cyanohydrins. Oh right! The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets protonated. So the product is a cyanohydrin, which has both an alcohol (OH) and a nitrile (CN) group on the same carbon.

So the first step is forming a cyanohydrin. For that, you usually need an acid catalyst. So reagent A would be something acidic, like H3O+ or maybe H2SO4. Looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and also might act as a reagent in other reactions, but in this case, for the cyanohydrin formation, H3O+ would probably be the catalyst.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized. The common reagents for oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong oxidizing agents. One such method is using a strong acid, like HCl, under certain conditions, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, using H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst and heat might help, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves treating with a strong acid like HCl in the presence of a peroxide or another oxidizing agent. Wait, but in this case, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps it's hydrolysis.

Wait, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, you typically use H2SO4 and H2O, often with heat. The product would be a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a base, you might get an ammonium salt, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's acidic hydrolysis.

So the reagent B would be H2O along with an acidic catalyst. The options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, looking at the options, in the options B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, the options for the second reaction's reagent B are:

Looking back: It says the second reaction is with reagent B (H2O). So the reagents would be B and H2O. So the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually need an acid catalyst. HCl can act as a catalyst, perhaps. Alternatively, H2SO4 is sometimes used. But in the options, the available options are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, so if I'm thinking about acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles, the setup would be H2O with a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. So in the options, B is either HCl (option A or B) or CH3COOH (other options).

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, which would help in the hydrolysis. So B is HCl.

Wait, but wait, there's another possibility. The first reaction is using H3O+ (from H2SO4 or HCl?), and the second reaction is using HCl as B. Let me check the options. The options are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if I think A is H3O+ and B is HCl, then that's option A.

Wait, but wait a moment. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is using H2O and an acid. So reagent B might be HCl, which is a strong acid, providing the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but another thought: Could the second reaction be an example of a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement? No, that's for isocyanates. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but that would give a carboxylate, not a carboxylic acid. So unless there's an acid workup, but in this case, the reagent is B, which is H2O perhaps with an acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely that the reaction conditions are acidic. So the second reaction uses H2O and HCl as an acid catalyst, leading to the formation of the carboxylic acid.

Putting it together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: nitrile + H2O and HCl → carboxylic acid.

So the reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. What about reagent A in the first step? NaCN is a good nucleophile, but the reaction of ketones with NaCN typically requires an acid catalyst. So H3O+ (a strong acid) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So the first step uses H3O+ as the catalyst, so A is H3O+.

The second step uses HCl as the acid, making B = HCl.

So the correct option is A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** is the suitable reagent for this purpose.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Acidic hydrolysis is typically used for this transformation, where a strong acid like **HCl** provides the acidic environment necessary for the reaction to occur. Therefore, **HCl** is the appropriate reagent for this step.

Combining these observations, the correct option is **A**, where reagent A is **H₃O⁺** and reagent B is **HCl**.

Answer: A
