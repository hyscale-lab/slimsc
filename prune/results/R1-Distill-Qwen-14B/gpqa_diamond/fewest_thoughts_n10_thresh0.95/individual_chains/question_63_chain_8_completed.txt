--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum mechanics models, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm. Wait, the options are giving momentum in N*s units. Right, because momentum p is mass times velocity, but photons have momentum equal to E/c, where E is energy and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, photons don't have mass, but their momentum is E/c. So, I can think about the energy of the photon and then convert that to momentum.

First, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, both rotationally and vibrationally. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. But what's the next state? The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I think that means the photon excitation would cause the molecule to change to the next higher energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But wait, maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model, or the rotation-vibration model, typically treats the vibrational and rotational energies together. So each energy level is a combination of vibrational and rotational states. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0, I think). Or wait, for a diatomic, the ground state for rotation is J=0 or J=1? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. I remember that for a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). But the ground state would be J=0. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. Then the next state could be either increasing v or increasing J.

Wait, but when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can either undergo vibrational excitation (changing v) or rotational excitation (changing J). Which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one requiring the least energy photon.

So, I need to calculate the energy required for the smallest possible jump. Let's see. The vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing determined by the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy levels have spacing determined by the rotational constant B, which depends on the moment of inertia.

The energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be the difference between E(J=1) and E(J=0). E(J) = B J (J+1), so E(1) - E(0) is B (1*2 - 0) = 2B.

So, I need to compute both ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational and see which is smaller. The photon that causes the transition would have energy equal to the smaller of these two.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the molecule could go to a state where both J and v increase. But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think they mean the minimal energy excitation, which would be the one with the smallest energy jump. So I need to compute the energy required for the vibrational transition and the rotational transition and compare.

Let me get the given data:

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's calculate that. Mx is 20, My is 2, so μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu. Wait, but I'll need to convert this into kg for calculations. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ approximately 3.013e-27 kg.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s. That's given, so I can use that for the vibrational part.

First, calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition. ΔE_vib = ħω. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ΔE_vib = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is 2B, where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R².

So I = μ R². Let's compute that. μ is 3.013e-27 kg, R is 2e-10 m. So I = 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.013e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.205e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I). So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46). Let's compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68. Denominator: 2 * 1.205e-46 = 2.41e-46. So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.41e-46 ≈ approximately 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68. 1.05457^2 is about 1.112, so yeah, 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * I = 2 * 1.205e-46 = 2.41e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41e-46 = (1.112 / 2.41) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but that's B. The energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is 2B, so that's 2 * 4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The vibrational energy difference was 4.218e-20 J, which is about 4e-20 J, and the rotational difference is 9.2e-23 J, which is about 9e-23 J. Comparing these, the rotational transition requires less energy. So that means the photon would have to match the rotational energy difference, as it's lower.

Wait, but wait another thing. In the non-rigid rotor model, I'm not entirely sure whether the transitions are purely rotational or vibrational. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest ΔE. So between the two, the rotational ΔE is smaller, so the photon would need to have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, photons have energy E = pc, because for photons, E = pc, since their mass is zero. So p = E/c. So the momentum p is E divided by speed of light c.

So for the rotational transition, E_rot = 9.2e-23 J. So p = E_rot / c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but that's 3.07e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, looking at the options, none of them are in the 1e-31 range. The options are 1e-27 and similar. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B, the rotational constant. Let me go back.

I think I might have messed up the calculation for B. Let me recompute I.

I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass. Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.013e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.013e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.205e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.41e-46) = approximately 4.61e-23 J.

So the energy for J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

Then the photon energy is 9.22e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.07e-31 N·s. Looking back at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28, which is 100,000 times larger. So there's a discrepancy here.

Hmm. Did I confuse the rotational and vibrational contributions? Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition that requires the least energy, which is the vibrational. Because 4e-20 J is much larger than the rotational 9e-23 J. So why then is the rotational transition requiring less energy?

Wait, no, 9e-23 is smaller than 4e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have energy of 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in B. Let me recompute B accurately.

Compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Divide by 2I: 2 * 1.205e-46 = 2.41e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41e-46 = (1.112 / 2.41) * 1e-22 = approximately 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational model. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So increasing J would lead to higher energy, but perhaps the next state is a combination of higher J and higher v.

Wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next possible state is either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). So we need to find which of those two transitions requires less energy.

The energy for the vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) is ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

The energy for the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So since 9.2e-23 is less than 4.2e-20, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have E=9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 N·s. But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the reduced mass calculation. Let me double-check. Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) ) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.013e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m. I = μ R^2 = 3.013e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.013e-27 *4e-20 = 1.205e-46 kg·m².

Hmm, that's correct. Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.41e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both, and the next state is a higher J with same v, or higher v with same J.

But in that case, the lowest energy transition would be the rotational one. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, so p=3.07e-31 kg·m/s, but none of the options are even close to that.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think: the options are in the 1e-27 range. Let's see, 1e-27 is larger than 1e-31 by four orders of magnitude (1e-27 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-31). Where could I have missed a factor of 1e4? Let's re-examine the units.

Wait, I think I messed up the moment of inertia. Oh wait! The bond length is given in angstroms. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, right. So R^2 is (2e-10 m)^2 =4e-20 m². So I= μ R^2 = 3.013e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.205e-46 kg·m². That seems correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the angular momentum, but I think I did it right with B being in Joules.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0), whichever requires the least energy.

Wait another thing. Alternatively, the question could be asking about the transition that requires the least possible energy, which would be the rotational one. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's momentum would be based on that.

But based on my calculation, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s or 3.07e-31 N·s. The options don't have such a small value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B, but maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me recompute B:

B = (ħ²) / (2 I )
I = μ R^2
= (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Wait, wait! No, earlier I correctly calculated I as 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.205e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46 )

= (1.112e-68) / (2.41e-46 )

= 4.61e-23 J.

Hmm, that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy but the vibrational energy. But then the energy would be 4.2e-20 J, which gives p=4.2e-20 /3e8 =1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Ah, wait! That's 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s. That's one of the options.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon have energy for the vibrational transition? Because perhaps the vibrational transition is the only possible, or it's the first possible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that has the smallest energy increment. So we have two possible transitions:

1. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0): ΔE = ΔE_vib = ħω = 4.2e-20 J.

2. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1): ΔE = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

The second transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, which would correspond to p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first possible transition, which may be the vibrational transition because the vibrational energy levels are higher than the rotational ones. Wait, no—if the rotational transition requires less energy, it's the lower energy transition.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Wait, perhaps the model being used is the rigid rotor, where the rotational energy levels are quantized, but the vibrational is treated separately. However, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, which I think does account for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but the rotational state is J=0. The next state could be J=1, which is a rotational transition. So the photon's energy must match this rotational transition.

But then, why is the correct answer not matching any of the options? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, let me recompute I. I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * R² = (20/11 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, but amu must be converted to kg. 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So,

I = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute step by step:

(20/11) ≈ 1.818.

So I = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg * 4e-20 m².

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.013.

So I = 3.013e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.205e-46 kg·m².

Then B = (ħ²) / (2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.205e-46 = 2.41e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is D) 1.4e-28 N·s, which is larger by about a factor of 46000.

Hmm. I'm stumped. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition from J=0 to J=1, which is the first rotational state, but perhaps the problem is actually considering the vibrational energy because the options include a value that matches the vibrational calculation.

Wait, if I compute the vibrational energy:

E_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E_vib /c=4.218e-20 /3e8 ≈1.406e-28 kg·m/s=1.406e-28 N·s. That's option D.

So perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, but why? Earlier calculation suggested the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the molecule transition via the vibrational route?

Ah, wait! Maybe I made a mistake in assessing which transition is possible. Let me think about the selection rules. For rotational transitions, in infrared spectroscopy, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, but for vibration, the selection rule is Δv=±1. But in the context of the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both, would the molecule absorb a photon that causes a change in both v and J?

Wait, but the question is about the molecule being in the fundamental state, and the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either higher v or higher J.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized as:

E(J, v) = E_vibrational(v) + E_rotational(J)

Where E_vibrational(v) = (v + 1/2)ħω, and E_rotational(J) = B J (J+1). So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0: E = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B*0 = (1/2)ħω.

The next state with the lowest energy would be the one where E is just above that. So the next possible state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Compute the energies:

E(v=1, J=0) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + 0 = (3/2)ħω.

E(v=0, J=1) = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B*(1)(2) = (1/2)ħω + 2B.

Now, which of these two is lower in energy?

Compute (3/2)ħω versus (1/2)ħω + 2B.

We know ħω is 4.218e-20 J.

So (3/2)ħω = 6.327e-20 J.

(1/2)ħω +2B = 2.109e-20 + 9.22e-23 ≈2.109e-20 + 0.0922e-20 = 2.201e-20 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is 2.201e-20 J, which is less than 6.327e-20 J. So the next state with the lowest energy is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of energy 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

But again, the momentum would be 3.07e-31 N·s, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0), which requires more energy but is perhaps the only allowed transition under certain conditions. But then, why would it be the next state with the lowest energy, since the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate μ.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

But wait, another way to think about μ is:

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I used it correctly as 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the problem differently. Perhaps the question is asking for the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could have both J and v increased, but that would require more energy. But that's not the case because the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the 'fundamental state' in the context refers to the rotationally relaxed state, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational contribution and only the vibrational. Since the options include an answer that matches the vibrational calculation, perhaps that's the intended correct option.

But why would the rotational transition require more energy than the vibrational? From my earlier calculation, the rotational requires less. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in B.

Wait, another approach: compute the vibrational and rotational energy differences.

Vibrational: E_vib = ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

Rotational: E_rot = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is smaller, so the photon would have E_rot.

But again, that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, the options are for the momentum of the photon. Let's compute the momentum for the vibrational transition:

p = E_vib / c =4.218e-20 J /3e8 m/s=1.406e-28 kg·m/s=1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I don't understand why the rotational transition requires more energy. Or perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition to be considered because the rotational model is not being used, but that seems contradictory to the question stating it's the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering rotation but only the vibration, which would be the case if the molecule is in a 'rigid rotor' model, but the problem says rotation-vibration model.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational transition, whichever has the lower energy. But from the calculations, the rotational requires less.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, B is the rotational constant, which is given by B= (ħ²)/(2I). But another expression I've heard is B= (h²)/(8π² I c), but perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps B is expressed in cm^-1, but that's a different unit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^{-1} and then convert to Joules. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I = μ R². Let me compute it again.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈3.013e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² =3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.013e-27 *4e-20 =1.205e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

So B= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.205e-46 )= 1.112e-68 / 2.41e-46=4.61e-23 J.

So 2B=9.22e-23 J.

E_photon_rot =9.22e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me compute I again.

I= μ R² = (Mx * My / (Mx + My)) * R².

Mx=20, My=2.

So I= (20*2)/(20+2) * R² = (40/22) * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps R is in angstroms, so R=2e-10 m is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute in terms of kg·m².

Yes, I did that earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as I= Mx My R² / (Mx + My). Which I think is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The only option that matches a calculation I did is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. But according to my earlier analysis, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is that the case?

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, only certain transitions are allowed. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the selection rules.

Wait, for rotational transitions in the rigid rotor model, a photon with the right energy is absorbed to change the rotational state. But in the context of the non-rigid model, perhaps transitions that change both J and v are allowed, but the problem states it's looking for the next state with the lowest possible energy, so it would be the minimal energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. That's the vibrational transition, and the energy is 4.2e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-28 N·s, option D.

But why would that be the next state with the lowest energy? Because the rotational transition to J=1 requires less energy, it should be the next state.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energies.

Wait, E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2) ħω + 2B.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) ħω.

So which is lower? Let's plug the numbers.

Compute E(v=0, J=1) = 0.5 *4.218e-20 + 9.22e-23 =2.109e-20 +0.0922e-20=2.201e-20 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = 6.327e-20 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is lower. So the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon of 9.22e-23 J. But this doesn't match any option.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the vibrational transition to be considered, but that doesn't align with the earlier analysis.

Hmm. At this point, I think that the intended correct answer is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. But I'm not entirely confident because according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. However, given that the options don't include the rotational momentum, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is D based on the vibrational transition.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu \approx 3.013 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)

### Vibrational Energy Transition:
The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

### Rotational Energy Transition:
The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \). First, calculate \( I \):
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.013 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.205 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]
Then, calculate \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.205 \times 10^{-46}} \approx \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{2.41 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]
The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison of Energy Differences:
- \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)
- \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)

The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the options, the vibrational transition is likely the intended answer. The momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]
This corresponds to **Option D**.
