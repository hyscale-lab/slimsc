Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because titrations can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

First, I think I need to figure out what happens during the dilution. When you mix equal volumes of the acid and water, the concentration of the acetic acid will decrease because the volume increases. So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and the volume doubles. So the new concentration should be half of 0.05, which is 0.025 M. Right, because concentration (M) is moles per liter, and diluting it with equal volume halves the concentration.

So after dilution, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which is a strong base) would be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Wait, so first, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (20+20), which is 0.04 liters. So moles = concentration × volume = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

So for the equivalence point, the NaOH needed would have moles equal to 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the question isn't about the volume needed for equivalence. It's about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So first, the 25% titration point. That would be when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Let me think about the reaction at this point. The acetic acid will react with NaOH to form acetate ions.

So the initial moles in the solution after dilution: 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react completely.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume here is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but wait the problem says when we titrate, so I have to consider the total volume after adding the titrant. But the question doesn't give the volume of NaOH used in 25% titration. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of concentrations without worrying about the exact volume, as it's a dilution.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the concentrations of the species after the reaction.

Wait, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution will be a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ions.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be applicable here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Let me compute that. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 (since 10^-5 is 5, but 1.85 is closer to 2, so 4.74 something? Wait, wait wait. Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1e5 /1.85) ≈ 4.74? Wait, let me compute this. Let me think: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) which is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

At 25% titration, the amount of acid neutralized is 25%, so the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3. Because for every mole of acid, 0.25 reacts to form 0.25 moles of conjugate base, leaving 0.75 acid.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.733 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.733 - 0.477 = approximately 4.256. So around 4.26 pH.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, what about the dilution effect? Because when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will also increase the volume of the solution. Ah, right. So the concentrations [A^-] and [HA] are moles divided by total volume.

Wait, but I think the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation accounts for the ratio of concentrations. Since both A^- and HA are in the same solution, their concentrations would be moles divided by the same total volume, so the ratio would be the same as the mole ratio. So perhaps the volume doesn't matter for the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation here. Oh wait, but in reality, adding NaOH does change the volume. Hmm, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and when adding, say, V cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume becomes (40 + V) cm³. So the concentrations of HA and A^- would each be (their moles) / (0.04 + V/1000) liters.

But in the 25% case, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 moles, which comes from volume = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 liters = 2.5 cm³.

So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

Wait, so the concentrations would be [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L and [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L. So their ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So the same as before. So the pH calculation remains 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that matches option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, when we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration is 0.025 M, but then when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.1 M, the moles are 0.00025. So the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³) = 0.001 mol. So yes, 25% of that is 0.00025.

So for the 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³=0.05 L.

The reaction produces 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+), which is a salt. Sodium comes from a strong base, and acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because the acetate ion is a weak base. So the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The acetate ion (A^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate in solution is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So, the Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, we can write:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is about 3.29e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH =14 -5.485=8.515, approximately 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence point is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, at equivalence point, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Kb is 5.405e-10. Using the approximation, x is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 )= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~3.29e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6, pOH is log(3.29e-6)=5.485, pH=8.515. So yes, 8.52. So option A's equivalence point is 8.52. The first part, 25% titration, was 4.26.

So the pH values at 25% and equivalence are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The initial dilution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, and the volume is 40 cm³. Then, when titrating, the initial concentration is 0.025 M. So for the 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol, and the total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³.

Wait, but in the 25% case, when I used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I considered the ratio [A^-]/[HA] as 1/3. But wait, perhaps I should account for the change in volume due to the added NaOH. Because the total solution volume increases, but the ratio of moles (0.25/0.75=1/3) remains the same, so the ratio of concentrations is also 1/3. So the same pH applies. So my earlier calculation was correct.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, doubling the volume to 40.00 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid becomes:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm³), giving a total volume of 42.5 cm³. The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of sodium acetate. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x \approx 0.02\). Solving:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
