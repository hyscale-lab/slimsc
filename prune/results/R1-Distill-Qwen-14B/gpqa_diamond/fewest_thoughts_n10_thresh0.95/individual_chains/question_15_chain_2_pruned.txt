Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about exoplanet transits, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, right? Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. Also, both have circular orbits. Their host stars have the same radius, but the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. The host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but that probably doesn't affect the transit probability much except maybe it's radius.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The options suggest that the probabilities differ by factors like 1.5, 2.25, etc.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, wait. The probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star plus planet to the distance between the star and planet, which is the semi-major axis. More precisely, the transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a), assuming that the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, which it usually is. So P ≈ (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, but wait. Another way I've heard it is that the probability is about the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our line of sight, which depends on the alignment. The chance is higher if the star is closer to the planet in size relative to the planet's distance.

So, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) divided by something else? Or is it (R_star + R_planet) / a? But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's usually approximated as R_star / (a * (1 - e)), but for circular orbits, e=0, so just R_star/a.

Wait, I think the exact formula is:

P ≈ (R_* + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 + M_p/(M_* + M_p))^0.5 )

Wait, no, that's the formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV method. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing things.

Wait, no, the transit probability is more about the geometry. The probability depends on the size of the star compared to the orbital distance. The formula is P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/(M_* + M_p))^0.5 )). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by another factor. Let me think.

Wait, I think the general formula is P ≈ (R_* )/(a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/(M_* + M_p))^0.5 )) )^{-1} or something like that. No, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the transit probability is about the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, which is roughly (R_* / a) * (something else). Let me get back.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_p/(M_* + M_p))^2 )) )) ). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. So P ∝ R_*/a. So the probability is proportional to the star's radius divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, I think that's correct. So, in this case, since they have the same star radius (both host stars have same radii), then the probability depends on 1/a. So the planet with the smaller a (semi-major axis) has a higher probability because a is in the denominator.

Wait, but wait. The orbital period is given, not the semi-major axis. But Kepler's third law relates the period and the semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) * a^3. Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_*.

So a ≈ ( (G(M_*) P^2)/(4π²) )^(1/3) )

But since M_* is different for each planet, we can find a for each.

Wait, let me think. Let's define a = ( ( (G(M_* + M_p)) P^2 )/(4π²) )^(1/3) ). Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_*
