Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so less calcium ions will be free in solution.

The formula for the formation constant (K) is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. I think that's the total concentration of the complex, meaning [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M.

Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, the stoichiometry is 1:1. So each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- ion. But wait, because the formation constant is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Since the EDTA is in excess or not? Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without considering dissociation, all the Ca is in the complex. But some of it will dissociate.

Wait, but if the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, then the initial concentrations are [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. When it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the assumption is that x is very small compared to 0.02. So [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. Because for each Ca²+ released, an EDTA^4- is released, assuming 1:1 stoichiometry.

So plugging into the equation: K = [Ca-EDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Which becomes 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 ⇒ 4e-13.

Wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2? Wait, 0.02 is 2 x 10^-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, let me calculate that. 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this. So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the
