Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit rusty on my optics and relativity, but let's think it through. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium as observed in the laboratory frame. 

So the setup is this: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass appears to be relative to the observer in the lab.

Hmm. I remember that the index of refraction is related to the speed of light in the medium. The formula is n = c / v_glass, where v_glass is the speed of light in the medium when the medium is at rest. Since c is 1, then v_glass would be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Wait, but wait a second. According to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames. But this is a medium (glass) moving through the lab frame. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light within it?

I think the key here is to consider how the speed of light is measured in the medium when the medium itself is moving. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_glass = 1/n, correct. But when the glass is moving, how does that change the observed speed from the lab frame?

Wait, but wait again. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties and the frame of reference. But in the lab frame, where the glass is moving, how is the light's speed measured?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The addition of velocities uses the Lorentz transformation. So if an object is moving at velocity u in the medium's frame, then in the lab frame (which sees the medium moving at velocity v), the object's velocity would be (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), but wait, that's for when the object is moving in the same direction as the medium. But wait, in this case, the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So perhaps we should apply the velocity addition formula.

But wait, in this scenario, the light is within the moving glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of the light is v_glass = 1/n. So from the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but isn't the velocity addition formula for when you have two velocities, say u in frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then, the velocity u' in S is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, that formula is for when the object's velocity in S' is u, and the frame S' is moving at v relative to S.

In this case, the light's velocity in the glass (S') frame is u = 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving at v in the lab frame (S). So the light's velocity in the lab frame, u', is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² ). But wait, wait. Because the light is in the same direction as the motion. So let's plug in u = 1/n, and v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab.

But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is going in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the light's velocity relative to the lab would be ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / c² ). But in the problem, c is 1. So it becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v ).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the moving frame (S'), and v is the velocity of S' relative to S (the lab frame). So yes, that's correct.

But wait a second, what's u here? In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n. So yes, plugging that in.

So the numerator is (1/n + v) and denominator is (1 + (1/n)*v ). So that gives us ( (v + 1/n) ) / ( 1 + (v/n) ). Let's factor that. Let's factor denominator and numerator:

Numerator: (v n + 1 ) / n.

Denominator: (n + v) / n.

So when we divide, the (n) in numerator and denominator cancels out. So the entire expression becomes (v n + 1)/(n + v ). Which simplifies to (1 + v n)/(n + v ), which is the same as (n v +1)/(n +v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v) which is the same as what I have. Option B is 1, which would imply the speed is c, but that's only in a vacuum. Since the light is in a medium, that's unlikely.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming that the speed of light in the glass is 1/n in its rest frame. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light within it? Because in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but also the frame of reference. So in the lab frame, the medium is moving, but the light's speed within it is still determined by the medium's index of refraction.

Wait, but in this scenario, the light is inside the moving glass. So in the lab frame, the speed of light should be different due to the motion of the glass. But I'm getting confused because normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the speed of light in the glass is always c in the lab frame, but that's not possible because the medium's movement would affect the direction. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is v=c/n, but the direction depends on the medium's velocity.

Wait, no, actually, the speed of light in a moving medium is still c in the lab frame. But that's only in the case of a vacuum. Wait, no, wait. The speed of light in a medium is governed by the medium's properties. It's c/n. But when the medium is moving, the speed of the light in the lab frame isn't just v_glass + v_medium, because light is a wave and the medium's motion would affect its propagation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about this again. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab, not about the speed of the glass itself. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n. So when the glass is moving at velocity v, the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed would be different. So we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

So using the formula u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab (since the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is in the same direction as the motion, perhaps v is positive? Or maybe it's negative if the glass is moving towards the observer but the light is moving in the same direction as
