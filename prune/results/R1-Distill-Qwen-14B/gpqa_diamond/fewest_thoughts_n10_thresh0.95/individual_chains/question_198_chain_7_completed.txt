Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I thought stability constants increase with the number of ligands? Hmm, but β4 is lower than β3. Maybe the order is different, or maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps the complexes change their structure beyond a certain point.

So, the stability constant, β, for a complex tells us how stable it is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, the species with the highest β will dominate. But here, β3 is the highest, then β2, then β1, and β4 is the lowest. Wait, but wait—wait, β4 is 16, which is higher than β1=9 but less than β2=40 and β3=63. Oh, so the order is β3 > β2 > β4 > β1? Or is β4 the stability constant for another complex?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The stability constants are for the formation of different complexes. So, for Co(SCN)n^2−n, the β would be the formation constant for each n. Like, β1 is for CoSCN^+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)2^0 (n=2), β3 for Co(SCN)3^- (n=3), β4 for Co(SCN)4^2− (n=4). Oh, right, the charge increases as n increases. So, wait, the βs given are for n=1,2,3,4 in that order. Then β3 is the most stable, β2 next, β4 is 16, which is higher than β1=9, so the order is β3>β2>β4>β1.

Wait, but why is β4 lower than β2 and β3? Because 16 is less than 40 and 63. Oh, right, so the most stable complex is the tris-thiocyanato, n=3, and then n=2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking about the dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. Oh, right, because the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which is the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)2^0.

So, we need to find the fraction of Co in the (SCN)2 form relative to all possible Co species.

The problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. But wait, the total cobalt includes all species: Co²+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)2^0, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2−. So, the sum of all these species equals 1e-2 M.

Thiocyanate is present at 0.1 M. So, SCN⁻ is 0.1 M.

We need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the Co(SCN)2^0 form.

Hmm, but how? I remember that for such problems, the formation of complexes can be modeled using the stability constants. The fraction of a particular complex can be found using the formula involving the formation constants and the concentrations of ligands.

Alternatively, the fraction is given by the ratio of the concentration of the desired complex to the total concentration of all Co species.

Let me write down the possible complexes and their formation constants:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}, with β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n)

So, for each n from 0 to 4 (well, n=0 is just Co²+), but given β1=9 (n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4).

Wait, but wait—what's the actual structure here? Because Co can form different complexes with SCN⁻. The problem is about the blue dithiocyanato, which is the n=2 complex. So, the blue color is from Co(SCN)₂^0.

But wait, I've heard that the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) complexes have different colors. The dithiocyanato (n=2) is blue, and the trithiocyanato (n=3) is more red. So, the question is about the percentage of the blue complex (n=2) compared to all Co species.

So, the approach is to find the fraction of Co in each complex, then sum them up, and find the fraction that's Co(SCN)_2^0.

But the problem is when multiple complexes can form, each with different β, how to calculate their concentrations.

I think the approach is to express each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co²+ concentration, then find the ratio.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x.

Then,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3 =63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4 =16 * x * (0.1)^4 =16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x.

Wait, but wait, the general formula is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co²+] * [SCN^-]^n.

So, for each n, that's correct.

Now, the total Co concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+:

Total Co = [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2−]

Which equals x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = sum all these terms.

Let me calculate each term:

x is the free Co²+.

Adding the terms:

x (1) +

0.9x = 0.9x

0.4x = 0.4x

0.063x = 0.063x

0.0016x = 0.0016x.

Adding all coefficients:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646.

So, the total [Co] = 2.3646 x.

But the problem states that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So,

2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Wait, that's the concentration of free Co²+.

Now, the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^0 is 0.4 x.

So, [Co(SCN)_2^0] = 0.4 * 4.225e-3 ≈ 1.69e-3 M.

The total Co is 1e-2 M, so the fraction is (1.69e-3) / (1e-2) = 0.169 → 16.9%.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option D is 16.9%.

But wait, I thought the problem was about the blue dithiocyanato, which is the n=2 complex. So why is the fraction only 16.9%? But wait, let me think again.

Wait, that's not right because the β3 is higher than β2. So, the n=3 complex would actually form more, which would take away more Co²+ from the solution, leading to lower [Co²+], but higher [Co(SCN)_3^-].

Wait, but in my calculation above, I considered all the terms, including up to n=4. But perhaps the assumption holds because the higher β for n=3 would mean more of that complex.

Wait, let me recheck my calculations. So, the [Co] is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion.

So, [Co] = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x.

So x = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Now, [Co(SCN)_2^0] is 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.004225 = 0.00169 M.

So, the fraction is (0.00169) / (0.01) = 0.169, 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I'm getting 16.9% for the n=2 complex. But isn't β3 higher than β2, so shouldn't the n=3 complex be more dominant? So why is n=2 only 16.9%?

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate each term.

Wait, let me compute each [Co(SCN)_n]^(something):

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

Adding all these up:

x (free Co²+) → x = 4.225e-3 M.

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9 * 4.225e-3 ≈ 3.8025e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = 0.4 *4.225e-3 ≈ 1.69e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = 0.063 *4.225e-3 ≈ 2.66e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = 0.0016 *4.225e-3 ≈ 6.76e-6 M.

Wait, let's add all these concentrations:

x → 4.225e-3.

CoSCN^+ → 3.8025e-3.

Co(SCN)_2 → 1.69e-3.

Co(SCN)_3 → 0.000266.

Co(SCN)_4 → 0.00000676.

Sum:

4.225e-3 + 3.8025e-3 = 8.0275e-3.

+1.69e-3 → 9.7175e-3.

+0.000266 → ~9.7441e-3.

+0.00000676 → ~9.74476e-3.

Wait, but the total is supposed to be 1e-2 M = 0.01 = 10e-3 M.

But the sum I'm getting is about 9.74e-3. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recompute the sum of the coefficients.

Earlier, the sum of the coefficients (without x) was:

1 (x) + 0.9 (β1 term) + 0.4 (β2) + 0.063 (β3) + 0.0016 (β4) → Total 2.3646.

So, 2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225.

But when I compute the sum of all species, I get about 9.744e-3, which is less than 1e-2. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the higher complexes (n=3 and n=4) contribute less, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the individual terms. Let me recheck:

x = 4.225e-3.

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9 * 4.225e-3 → 0.9 * 0.004225 = 0.0038025.

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.4 * 0.004225 = 0.00169.

[Co(SCN)_3] = 0.063 *0.004225 = approximately 0.000266.

[Co(SCN)_4] = 0.0016 *0.004225 = 0.00000676.

Adding all these:

x: 0.004225.

CoSCN^+: 0.0038025.

Co(SCN)_2: 0.00169.

Co(SCN)_3: 0.000266.

Co(SCN)_4: 0.00000676.

Sum:

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275.

+0.00169 → 0.0097175.

+0.000266 → 0.0099835.

+0.00000676 → 0.00999026.

Ah, that's about 0.00999 M, which is ~1e-2 M, as desired. So the calculation is correct. The sum is about 0.01 M, so the initial calculation holds.

So the concentration of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex is 0.00169 M.

The fraction is (0.00169)/(0.01) )= 0.169 → 16.9%.

Which is option D.

But wait, wait—this seems low. Because the β3 is higher than β2, so I would expect that the n=3 complex is more dominant than n=2. But in the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_3^-] is 0.000266 M, and [Co(SCN)_2^0] is 0.00169 M. So, the n=2 is higher than n=3.

Wait, why is that? Because even though β3 is higher than β2, the effect of [SCN^-] is lower for higher n. Because for n=3, [SCN^-]^3 is 0.1^3 = 0.001, whereas for n=2, it's 0.01.

So, β3 is 63, multiplied by (0.1)^3 = 0.001 → 63 * 0.001 = 0.063 in the coefficient.

Whereas β2 is 40, multiplied by (0.1)^2 = 0.01 → 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 in the coefficient.

So, 0.4x is higher than 0.063x, even though β3 is higher. Because the [SCN^-] is 0.1, so for higher n, the [SCN^-]^n term gets smaller more quickly.

So, in terms of the product β_n * [SCN^-]^n, n=2 is more favorable than n=3 here. Because 40*(0.1)^2=4, and 63*(0.1)^3=0.63. Wait, wait, no—Wait, no, in the calculation, each [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n * x * [SCN]^n. So, for each n, the coefficient is β_n * [SCN]^n.

Wait, for n=2, coefficient is 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

For n=3, 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

So, the n=2 coefficient is larger than n=3's. Thus, the [Co(SCN)_2] is larger than [Co(SCN)_3], even though β3 is higher than β2. Because the [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is a lower concentration than what would be needed to make up for the higher β.

Wait, but the problem states that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, for n=2, [SCN] is 0.1, so (0.1)^2 = 0.01. For n=3, (0.1)^3 = 0.001. So, the [SCN] isn't extremely high, which means that for higher n, the effect of βn is less pronounced because the [SCN]^n term is getting smaller.

So, the calculation seems correct.

But wait, the problem says to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So, that's the n=2 complex, which is 16.9% of the total Co.

So, the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂⁰, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the equilibrium formation of cobalt-thiocyanate complexes using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Formation of Complexes**:  
   The cobalt species in solution include free Co²⁺ and its complexes: CoSCN⁺, Co(SCN)₂⁰, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄²⁻. The formation constants are given as:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n} = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   Using this formula, the concentrations of all cobalt species can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, \(x\).

2. **Expression for Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x
   \]
   Given that \([\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\), we solve for \(x\) (free Co²⁺):
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Concentration of Co(SCN)₂⁰**:  
   The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)₂⁰, is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x
   \]
   Substituting \(x \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = 0.4 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \approx 1.69 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Fraction of Co(SCN)₂⁰**:  
   The fraction of Co(SCN)₂⁰ among all cobalt species is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.69 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} = 0.169 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂⁰, among all cobalt species is **16.9%**.
