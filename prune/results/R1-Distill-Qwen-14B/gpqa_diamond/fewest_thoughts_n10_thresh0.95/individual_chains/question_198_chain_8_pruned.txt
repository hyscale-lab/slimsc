Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to walk through it.

So, the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, the stability constants increase with the formation of more stable complexes. Oh wait, maybe the order is different. Let me think.

Stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. So, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe I have the charges wrong, but the key is that each β represents the stepwise formation.

But wait, the problem is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which probably means the ones with two SCN- ligands. So, I think that refers to [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^something else? Wait, no, wait. The blue complexes are probably the ones that are more stable. Since β3 is the largest (63), that would be the most stable. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ions. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So, I need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} or another dithiocyanato species.

Wait, let's clarify. The possible complexes are:

Co²+ (free ion)
CoSCN+ (monodentate, β1)
Co(SCN)₂^2+ (dithiocyanato, β2)
Co(SCN)₃^0 (tridentate, β3)
Co(SCN)₄^2- (tetradentate, β4=16)

But wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. That's a bit confusing because β3 is bigger than β2. So, the tris complex is more stable than the di? Hmm, that might mean that the most of the cobalt would form the tri complex, but the question is about the di complex.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^something else. Wait, no, dithiocyanato is two SCN- ions. So, it's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex.

But wait, maybe the problem is considering all complexes with two SCN- ions, but in this case, it's only the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex.

So, to find the percentage, I need to calculate the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ in the solution.

But how? I think I need to use the stability constants and the concentrations to calculate the fraction each species contributes.

Stability constants relate the concentration of the complexes to the free metal and ligand. So, for each complex, the concentration is given by the product of the stability constant and the concentrations of the metal and ligands, considering the stoichiometry.

So, the general approach is to consider all possible complexes (from n=0 to n=4), calculate their concentrations, and then sum them up. Then, the fraction for each complex is its concentration divided by the total.

But wait, the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M. But the total includes all species: free Co²+, all the complexes. So, the sum of all [Co species] = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but when calculating the fractions, I should consider that the sum of all species equals the total concentration.

But I'm a bit stuck on how to approach this. Let me think about the formation of each complex step by step.

Each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth SCN- ion.

So, for example:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂^2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^0]/([Co(SCN)₂^2+][SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co(SCN)3^0][SCN^-])

So, the overall formation constant for each complex would be the product of the β's up to that point.

Wait, no, each β is the stepwise constant. So, the formation constant K_n for the complex with n SCN- is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me correct. For each step, the formation constant K1 is [ML]/([M][L]) = β1.

K2 is [ML₂]/([M][L]^2) = β1 * β2.

Similarly, K3 = β1 β2 β3.

Wait, no. Because each β is the stepwise constant. So, K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, for the di complex (n=2), K2 = β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

K4=22680 *16= 362880.

But wait, that would be the overall formation constants for each complex.

But I'm not sure if I need to calculate each K and then use them to find the concentrations.

Alternatively, another approach is to model the distribution of cobalt species based on the stepwise constants.

But this can get complicated, as the number of species increases with n.

Alternatively, perhaps an approximation can be made, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in this problem, we're asked only about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes. So, maybe I can compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and any other species with two SCN- ions. But wait, in the given βs, the n=2 is the di complex.

Wait, but earlier I thought each β is stepwise, so the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is formed via β2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the distribution of each species.

Wait, another approach is to consider the distribution of cobalt between all possible complexes and the free ion, using the given β's and the concentrations of SCN^-.

But this seems complicated because there are four possible complexes, each with varying numbers of SCN- ions.

But perhaps there's a way to calculate the fraction of each species.

Let me consider that the concentration of free Co²+ is [Co²+], and each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} has a concentration given by the product of the β's up to n and the appropriate powers of [SCN^-] and [Co²+].

Wait, perhaps using the expressions for each species in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-].

But with multiple species, this can get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that the majority of the complexes form the most stable ones, so the highest β would dominate. But in this case, β3 is the largest (63), so K3 would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680, which is a very large constant. So, the [Co(SCN)3]^0 complex would be the most abundant.

But wait, the question is about the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex.

So, perhaps even though the tris complex is more stable, the availability of SCN- may influence the distribution.

Wait, because the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is not extremely high. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the method of successive approximations or to set up equations based on the stability constants.

Let me try to outline the approach.

The formation of each complex occurs stepwise:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN+; β1=9.

CoSCN+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂^2+; β2=40.

Co(SCN)₂^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)3^0; β3=63.

Co(SCN)3^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)4^2-; β4=16.

Each step has its own β.

The total cobalt concentration is [Co_total] = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^0] + [Co(SCN)4^2-} ] = 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

But in reality, the formation of complexes will consume some of the SCN^-; however, given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and the total Co is 1e-2 M, the change in [SCN^-] might be negligible, but I'm not sure. Let me think: each Co can bind up to 4 SCN. So, for 0.01 M Co, maximum consumption is 0.04 M SCN. But initial SCN is 0.1 M, so after complexation, SCN would be 0.1 - 0.04 =0.06 M. That's a significant change. So, I can't ignore the consumption of SCN^-.

Wait, but considering that the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, perhaps it's the total concentration, including what's bound in complexes. Or is it the free SCN^-?

Wait, the question says the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. I think this is the total concentration, including that in complexes. No, wait, no. Typically, when given [SCN^-], it's the free ion unless stated otherwise. Or perhaps it's the total, including bound. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion. Because if the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, and the total is Co and SCN, then the complexes consume some of the SCN-.

Wait, but in the solution, the total SCN is 0.1 M, which includes both free and bound. So the sum of all SCN in complexes plus free SCN equals 0.1 M.

Yes, that's more accurate. So, [SCN_total] = [SCN^-]_free + sum of (n_i * [Co(SCN)_n]) for each complex, where n_i is the number of SCN in each complex.

Wait, but that complicates things, because you have two variables: [Co²+] and [SCN^-]_free.

And you have the total Co and total SCN.

Wait, the total Co is given as 0.01 M.

Total SCN is 0.1 M.

Let me write down the variables:

Let [Co²+] = x.

[CoSCN+] = y.

[Co(SCN)₂^2+] = z.

[Co(SCN)3^0] = w.

[Co(SCN)4^2-} ] = v.

Total Co: x + y + z + w + v = 0.01.

Total SCN: [SCN^-]_free + y*(1) + z*(2) + w*(3) + v*(4) =0.1.

But wait, each complex holds a certain number of SCN- ions. So, for [CoSCN+], each has 1 SCN, [Co(SCN)₂^2+] has 2, etc.

So, the total SCN is:

[SCN_total] = [SCN^-]_free + y*1 + z*2 + w*3 + v*4 = 0.1.

But that's two equations with several variables. There are five variables, which is a bit of a problem.

But we also have the stability constants.

Each β relates the concentrations of the complexes and the ions.

So, for β1:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]) = 9.

So, y = β1 x [Co²+][SCN^-] = 9 x * s, where s is [SCN^-]_free.

Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)₂^2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]) =40.

So, z = β2 y s =40 y s.

But y is 9 x s, so z=40*(9 x s) * s = 40*9 x s² = 360 x s².

Similarly, β3 = [Co(SCN)3^0]/([Co(SCN)₂^2+][SCN^-})=63.

So, w=β3 z s =63 z s =63*(360 x s²)*s=63*360 x s^3=22680 x s^3.

β4= [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co(SCN)3^0][SCN^-})=16.

So, v=β4 w s =16 w s =16*(22680 x s^3)*s=16*22680 x s^4=362880 x s^4.

Now, we can express all variables in terms of x and s.

So,

x = x

y =9 x s

z=360 x s²

w=22680 x s³

v=362880 x s^4

Now, the total Co is x + y + z +w +v =0.01.

So,

x +9x s +360x s² +22680x s³ +362880 x s^4 =0.01.

We can factor out x:

x [1 +9 s +360 s² +22680 s^3 +362880 s^4 ] = 0.01.

Equation 1.

Equation 2 comes from the total SCN:

s + y*1 + z*2 +w*3 +v*4 =0.1.

Substituting y, z, w, v:

s + (9x s) *1 + (360x s²)*2 + (22680x s^3)*3 + (362880x s^4)*4 =0.1.

Let me compute each term:

s +9x s + 720 x s² + 68040 x s^3 + 1451520 x s^4 =0.1.

Factor out s:

s [1 +9x +720 x s +68040 x s² +1451520 x s^3 ] =0.1.

But this seems very complicated. It's a system of two equations with two variables x and s.

But solving this system analytically might be quite challenging. So perhaps we can make some approximations.

Looking at the β values, β3 is the largest, which suggests that the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)3]^0. So, perhaps the majority of the cobalt is in the tris complex. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex.

Wait, but even if the tris complex is dominant, perhaps the dithiocyanato is the next major species. Let me think.

But given the high β3, the tris complex will likely be dominant, so maybe the dithiocyanato (di) is not that large a fraction. But let's see.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the concentration of the tris complex is much larger than the others, so perhaps the di and tetra are negligible. But given β3 is 63, and β4 is 16, which is lower, but perhaps the tetra is not that high.

But let's proceed.

Perhaps assuming that the concentration of the tris complex is much larger than the others, so that the tetra complex is negligible. But that's an assumption; let's see.

Alternatively, let me consider that the tetra complex is formed from the tris complex, but with a lower β, so perhaps the tris is more abundant.

But how can we proceed without making approximations?

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the free [SCN^-] is much lower, so that the higher-order complexes may not form as much.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an assumption that [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M because the binding is not too significant. But earlier, I thought that the binding could lower [SCN^-] to about 0.06 M. But perhaps that's a manageable change.

Wait, if I ignore the consumption of SCN- by the complexes, then [SCN^-] =0.1 M.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Let me try that and see where it gets me.

If [SCN^-] =0.1 M, then s=0.1.

Let me substitute s=0.1 into equation 1.

Equation 1: x (1 +9*(0.1) +360*(0.1)^2 +22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4) =0.01.

Compute each term:

1 =1

9 *0.1=0.9

360*(0.01)=3.6

22680*(0.001)=22.68

362880*(0.0001)=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, x *64.468 =0.01.

x=0.01 /64.468 ≈0.000155 M.

So, x≈1.55e-4 M.

Now, compute y, z, w, v.

y=9x s =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1= 1.395e-5.

z=360 x s²=360 *1.55e-4*(0.01) =360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4.

w=22680 x s^3=22680 *1.55e-4*(0.001)=22680 *1.55e-7=3.5142e-3.

v=362880 x s^4=362880 *1.55e-4*(0.0001)=362880 *1.55e-8≈5.62e-3.

Now, let's sum all the Co species:

x=1.55e-4,

y=1.395e-5,

z=5.58e-4,

w=3.5142e-3,

v=5.62e-3.

Sum: 0.000155 + 0.00001395 + 0.000558 +0.0035142 +0.00562 ≈ let's compute:

0.000155 ≈ 1.55e-4,

0.00001395≈1.395e-5,

0.000558≈5.58e-4,

0.0035142≈3.5142e-3,

0.00562≈5.62e-3.

Adding these:

1.55e-4 +1.395e-5 = approx 1.69e-4.

+5.58e-4 → ~7.27e-4.

+3.5142e-3 → ~4.24e-3.

+5.62e-3 → ~9.86e-3.

But the total Co is 0.01 M (1e-2 M = 0.01). So in this case, the sum is 0.00986, which is close to 0.01, but about 1.4% less. Hmm, so the approximation where [SCN^-]=0.1 M is leading to a sum that's a bit low. So perhaps the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 is not entirely accurate, but perhaps it's close enough for an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is a bit off, but perhaps it's a reasonable approximation.

But more importantly, let's compute the fraction of each species.

The question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂^2+] (z) and any other species with two SCN-? No, I think it's specifically the [Co(SCN)₂^2+] complex.

So, the percentage is (z / total Co) *100.

z is 5.58e-4 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So (5.58e-4 /0.01)*100 =5.58%.

Wait, but that's only about 5.58% of the Co is in the di complex. But looking at the answer options, the lowest is 16.9%. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 is not correct because some of it is bound in complexes, reducing the free [SCN^-].

So, perhaps I have to account for the actual [SCN^-] by solving the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the majority of the Co is in the tris complex.

Wait, in the scenario where s=0.1, the tris complex is w=3.5142e-3 M, which is about 35 mM. The tetra is v=5.62e-3 M (56 mM). So, w and v sum to about 91 mM, which is ~0.91 M? Wait, no, 3.5e-3 +5.6e-3=9.1e-3 M, which is about 9 mM. So, the Co in w and v is 9.1 mM. The total Co is 10 mM. So, about 90% of the Co is in the tris and tetra complexes.

But according to the options, the highest percentage is 42.3% in option A. So, perhaps my initial approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the K's. Because each β is stepwise, and I might have misapplied them.

Wait, let's re-examine the formation of the complexes.

The first complex, [CoSCN]^+, has a formation constant β1=9.

The second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, has a stepwise β2=40.

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)3]^0 is β1 β2 β3=9*40*63= 22680.

And for [Co(SCN)4]^2-, it's β1 β2 β3 β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation constant K_n for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

But the concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each step involves adding one SCN^-.

Wait, for the first complex:

K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-}) = β1=9.

For the second complex:

K2 = [Co(SCN)₂^2+]/([Co²+][SCN^-}^2) = β1 β2=9*40=360.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because K2 would be [Co(SCN)₂^2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-})=β2=40.

So, [Co(SCN)₂^2+} = β2 [CoSCN+][SCN^-}.

But [CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}.

So, substituting:

[Co(SCN)₂^2+} = β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2.

So, K2 = β1 β2 =360.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3^0} = β3 [Co(SCN)₂^2+} [SCN^-}.

Which is β3 * β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3.

So, K3=β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)4^2-} = β4 [Co(SCN)3^0} [SCN^-}.

Which is β4 * K3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4.

So, K4=β1 β2 β3 β4= 362880.

So, the concentrations of each complex are:

[CoSCN+] = K1 [Co²+][SCN^-}.

[Co(SCN)₂^2+} = K2 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2.

[Co(SCN)3^0} = K3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3.

[Co(SCN)4^2-} = K4 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4.

So, the total concentration of Co is:

[Co²+] + K1 [Co²+][SCN^-} + K2 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2 + K3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3 + K4 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4 = 0.01.

Factor out [Co²+}:

[Co²+] [1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s³ + K4 s^4] =0.01.

Where s = [SCN^-}.

But here, s is the free [SCN^-}.

But we also have the total SCN concentration:

Total SCN = [SCN^-} + [CoSCN+] + 2 [Co(SCN)₂^2+} + 3 [Co(SCN)3^0} +4 [Co(SCN)4^2-} ] = 0.1.

Which can be written as:

s + (K1 [Co²+} s) + 2 (K2 [Co²+} s²) +3 (K3 [Co²+} s³) +4 (K4 [Co²+} s^4) =0.1.

But this is getting complicated. Let me denote [Co²+} as x.

Then,

Equation 1: x [1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s³ + K4 s^4] = 0.01.

Equation 2: s + K1 x s + 2 K2 x s² +3 K3 x s^3 +4 K4 x s^4 =0.1.

But with K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and s. It's a bit of a nonlinear system and may be difficult to solve algebraically. Perhaps we can make an assumption about s.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution.

Let me consider that x is much smaller than the other terms, but given that the K's are large (especially K3 and K4), perhaps the higher complexes dominate.

Wait, let me think about the possible concentrations.

Given that K3 is 22680, which is very large, the tris complex [Co(SCN)3]^0 will be the dominant species. So, the majority of the Co will be in the tris complex. Let's see.

If that's the case, then the concentration of [Co(SCN)3} is approximately 0.01 M.

But let's check.

If [Co(SCN)3} =0.01 M, then:

[Co(SCN)3} = K3 x s^3 =0.01.

So, x = 0.01/(K3 s^3) =0.01/(22680 s^3) = approx 4.42e-7 / s^3.

But substitute into equation 2.

Equation 2: s + K1 x s + 2 K2 x s² +3 K3 x s^3 +4 K4 x s^4 =0.1.

If x is very small, because K3 is large, then the terms K3 x s^3 and K4 x s^4 would be significant, but others (like K1 x s) would be negligible.

So, equation 2 can be approximated as:

s +3 K3 x s^3 +4 K4 x s^4 ≈0.1.

But from [Co(SCN)3} = K3 x s^3 =0.01.

So, 3 K3 x s^3 =3*(0.01)=0.03.

Similarly, 4 K4 x s^4 =4*(0.01)*s = 0.04 s.

So, equation 2 becomes:

s +0.03 +0.04 s ≈0.1.

Combine terms: (1 +0.04) s +0.03 =0.1 →1.04 s =0.07 →s=0.07/1.04≈0.0673 M.

So, s≈0.0673 M.

Now, with s≈0.0673, we can compute x.

From [Co(SCN)3} = K3 x s^3 =0.01.

So, x =0.01/(K3 s^3) =0.01/(22680*(0.0673)^3).

Compute (0.0673)^3: 0.0673^3 ≈0.0673 *0.0673 =0.004529, then *0.0673 ≈0.000305.

So, x=0.01/(22680 *0.000305) ≈0.01/(6.9237) ≈0.001445 M.

Wait, that's 1.445e-3 M.

But wait, let's check the other terms in equation 1.

Equation 1: x [1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s³ + K4 s^4 ] =0.01.

Compute each term:

K1 s =9 *0.0673≈0.6057.

K2 s² =360 * (0.0673)^2 ≈360 *0.004529≈1.630.

K3 s^3 =22680 *0.000305≈6.9237.

K4 s^4 =362880 * (0.0673)^4 ≈362880 * (0.0673)^4.

Compute (0.0673)^4: 0.0673^2=0.004529; square again: 0.004529^2≈2.052e-5.

So, 362880 *2.052e-5 ≈362880 *2.052e-5 ≈7.455.

So, now sum all terms:

1 +0.6057 +1.630 +6.9237 +7.455 ≈17.614.

So, equation 1: x *17.614 =0.01 →x=0.01/17.614≈5.67e-4 M.

Hmm, but earlier calculation using the approximation for s gave x≈1.445e-3, which is larger than 5.67e-4.

So, there's some inconsistency here. It suggests that the assumption that only the tris and tetra complexes are significant may not hold, or that the approximation needs refinement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the value x≈5.67e-4 and see what s is.

Wait, let's compute s again using the refined x.

Equation 2: s +3 K3 x s^3 +4 K4 x s^4 =0.1.

We have x=5.67e-4.

Compute 3 K3 x s^3: 3 *22680 *5.67e-4 *s^3.

22680 *5.67e-4 ≈12.82.

3 *12.82=38.46.

So, 3 K3 x s^3 =38.46 s^3.

Similarly, 4 K4 x s^4: 4 *362880 *5.67e-4 *s^4.

362880 *5.67e-4 ≈205.67.

4 *205.67=822.68.

So, 4 K4 x s^4 =822.68 s^4.

So, equation 2 becomes:

s +38.46 s^3 +822.68 s^4 ≈0.1.

This is a quartic equation, which is challenging to solve.

But perhaps we can make an initial guess for s.

From earlier, we had an approximate s of 0.0673.

Let me plug s=0.0673 into the equation.

Compute each term:

s=0.0673.

38.46 s^3 =38.46*(0.0673)^3≈38.46*0.000305≈0.01173.

822.68 s^4=822.68*(0.0673)^4≈822.68*2.052e-5≈0.01686.

So, sum:

0.0673 +0.01173 +0.01686≈0.09589.

Which is less than 0.1, so we need a higher s to make the sum reach 0.1.

Let me try s=0.07.

Compute:

s=0.07.

38.46*(0.07)^3=38.46*0.000343≈0.01321.

822.68*(0.07)^4=822.68*0.0002401≈0.1976.

Sum: 0.07 +0.01321 +0.1976=0.28081. That's too high.

Hmm, went from 0.09589 at s=0.0673 to 0.2808 at s=0.07. We need to find s where the sum is 0.1.

Let me try s=0.065.

s=0.065.

s^3=0.065^3=0.0002746.

38.46 *0.0002746≈0.01058.

s^4=0.065^4≈0.00001785.

822.68 *0.00001785≈0.01476.

Sum: 0.065 +0.01058 +0.01476≈0.09034.

Still below 0.1.

We need sum=0.1.

We have at s=0.065: sum≈0.09034.

At s=0.0673: sum≈0.09589.

At s=0.068:

s=0.068.

s^3=0.068^3=0.000314.

38.46 *0.000314≈0.01209.

s^4=0.068^4= (0.068)^2 * (0.068)^2=0.004624 *0.004624≈2.138e-5.

822.68 *2.138e-5≈0.0176.

Sum:0.068 +0.01209 +0.0176≈0.09769.

Still less than 0.1.

At s=0.069:

s=0.069.

s^3=0.069^3≈0.0003285.

38.46*0.0003285≈0.01262.

s^4≈(0.069)^4≈0.0000226.

822.68*0.0000226≈0.01857.

Sum: 0.069 +0.01262 +0.01857=0.10019.

Oh, that's very close to 0.1. So, s≈0.069 M.

So, [SCN^-}≈0.069 M.

Now, let's compute x from equation 1.

Equation 1: x [1 + K1 s + K2 s² + K3 s³ + K4 s^4 ] =0.01.

Compute each term:

K1 s=9 *0.069≈0.621.

K2 s²=360*(0.069)^2≈360 *0.004761≈1.714.

K3 s^3=22680*(0.069)^3≈22680 *0.0003285≈7.423.

K4 s^4=362880*(0.069)^4≈362880 *0.0000226≈8.197.

Now, sum all terms:

1 +0.621=1.621 +1.714=3.335 +7.423=10.758 +8.197=18.955.

So, equation 1: x *18.955 =0.01 →x=0.01/18.955≈5.27e-4 M.

So, x≈5.27e-4 M.

Now, compute each complex concentration:

[CoSCN+] = K1 x s=9 *5.27e-4 *0.069≈5.27e-4 *0.621≈3.28e-4.

[Co(SCN)₂^2+} = K2 x s²=360 *5.27e-4 * (0.069)^2≈360 *5.27e-4 *0.004761≈360 *2.506e-6≈9.02e-4.

[Co(SCN)3^0}= K3 x s^3=22680 *5.27e-4 * (0.069)^3≈22680 *5.27e-4 *0.0003285≈22680 *1.726e-7≈3.91e-3.

[Co(SCN)4^2-}= K4 x s^4=362880 *5.27e-4 * (0.069)^4≈362880 *5.27e-4 *0.0000226≈362880 *1.197e-8≈4.34e-3.

Now, let's check the sum of all Co species:

x=5.27e-4,

[CoSCN+]=3.28e-4,

[Co(SCN)₂^2+}=9.02e-4,

[Co(SCN)3^0}=3.91e-3,

[Co(SCN)4^2-}=4.34e-3.

Sum: 5.27e-4 +3.28e-4 =8.55e-4.

+9.02e-4 →1.757e-3.

+3.91e-3 →5.667e-3.

+4.34e-3 →1.0007e-2.

Which is approximately 0.01 M, so that checks out.

Now, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂^2+}.

So, [Co(SCN)₂^2+}=9.02e-4 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So, fraction is 9.02e-4 / 0.01 =0.0902 →9.02%.

Wait, but the options are all over 16% except option D, which is 16.9%.

Hmm, but that's not matching. So perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, wait, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the K's.

Wait, no, K2= β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, K3=9*40*63=22680.

But I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given as the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. Because otherwise, the numbers are getting too big.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. If they are stepwise, then K_n is the product of the first n β's.

But maybe in this problem, the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex.

Wait, that would make more sense, perhaps.

So, for [CoSCN+]^+, β1=9 is the overall stability constant K1=9.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ has K2=40.

[Co(SCN)3]^0 has K3=63.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- has K4=16.

So, each K is the overall stability constant for the complex, not stepwise.

That would change the calculations.

So, the concentration of each complex would be:

[CoSCN+] = K1 [Co²+][SCN^-}.

[Co(SCN)₂^2+} = K2 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2.

[Co(SCN)3^0} = K3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3.

[Co(SCN)4^2-} = K4 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4.

So, the total Co is:

[Co²+] + K1 [Co²+][SCN^-} + K2 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2 + K3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3 + K4 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4 =0.01.

Factor out [Co²+}:

[Co²+] [1 + K1 s + K2 s^2 + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4 ] =0.01.

Equation 1.

Equation 2: The total SCN is s + [CoSCN+] + 2 [Co(SCN)₂^2+} +3 [Co(SCN)3^0} +4 [Co(SCN)4^2-} ] =0.1.

Which becomes:

s + K1 [Co²+} s + 2 K2 [Co²+} s^2 +3 K3 [Co²+} s^3 +4 K4 [Co²+} s^4 =0.1.

Let me denote [Co²+} as x.

So,

Equation 1: x [1 +9 s +40 s² +63 s³ +16 s^4 ] =0.01.

Equation 2: s +9 x s + 80 x s² +189 x s^3 +64 x s^4 =0.1.

Hmm, this is a system of two equations with two variables x and s.

But solving this system is tricky. Let me see if I can make any approximations.

Given the stability constants, K3=63 is the largest, so the tris complex will likely dominate. So, maybe the majority of Co is in the tris complex.

Let's assume that [Co(SCN)3^0} ≈0.01 M.

So, [Co(SCN)3^0}= K3 x s^3=63 x s^3=0.01.

So, x=0.01/(63 s^3).

Substitute into equation 2.

Equation 2: s +9 x s +80 x s² +189 x s^3 +64 x s^4 =0.1.

Substituting x=0.01/(63 s^3):

s +9*(0.01/(63 s^3)) s +80*(0.01/(63 s^3)) s² +189*(0.01/(63 s^3)) s^3 +64*(0.01/(63 s^3)) s^4 =0.1.

Simplify each term:

Term1: s.

Term2: 9*(0.01)/(63) * (s^0) = (9 * 0.01)/(63) = 0.09/63≈0.0014286.

Term3:80 *0.01/(63) * s^{-1} * s² =80*0.01/(63) * s = (0.8)/(63) *s ≈0.012698 s.

Term4:189 *0.01/(63) * s^3/(s^3)= 189 *0.01/63 =1.89/63=0.03.

Term5:64 *0.01/(63) * s^4/(s^3) =64 *0.01/(63) s = (0.64)/(63) s≈0.010159 s.

So, equation 2 becomes:

s + 0.0014286 +0.012698 s +0.03 +0.010159 s ≈0.1.

Combine like terms:

s*(1 +0.012698 +0.010159) +0.0014286 +0.03 ≈0.1.

So,

s*(1.022857) +0.0314286 ≈0.1.

So,

s ≈ (0.1 -0.0314286)/1.022857 ≈0.0685714 /1.022857≈0.067 M.

So, s≈0.067 M.

Now, compute x from [Co(SCN)3^0}=63 x s^3=0.01.

x=0.01/(63 * (0.067)^3).

Compute (0.067)^3: 0.067 *0.067=0.004489, *0.067≈0.0003004.

So, x=0.01/(63 *0.0003004) =0.01/(0.0189282) ≈0.5275 M.

Wait, that can’t be right because [Co²+] can't be higher than the total Co concentration of 0.01 M. So, this suggests that our assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that [Co(SCN)3} is 0.01 M is wrong because the other complexes also contribute.

So, perhaps the tris complex isn't the dominant one, which would mean our earlier approach is not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetra complex is more significant than I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it, and the answer relies on considering the relative stability of the complexes.

Wait, another approach could be to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the most stable one.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of the dominant term.

Given that K3=63 is the largest, the tris complex dominates. So, perhaps the percentage of the di complex is negligible.

But the options don't have such a low percentage, the lowest being 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the ratio of the formation constants to determine the distribution.

The fraction of each complex can be approximated by considering the ratio of their formation constants relative to the most stable complex.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is (K_n) / (sum of all K_i) ).

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, the fraction of each complex can be approximated as f_n = K_n / (K1 + K2 + K3 + K4).

But that's an approximation.

So, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Sum of K's: 9+40+63+16=128.

Fraction of K2:40/128≈0.3125 →31.25%.

But the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

So, 31.25% isn't an option.

Hmm, but perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is calculated based on the logarithms of the stability constants.

But I'm not remembering the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the log of the fraction is proportional to the log of the stability constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions can be determined using the formula:

f_n = (K_n) / (sum K_i) ?

Wait, but earlier that gave 31.25%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are based on the relative formation constants.

Wait, another approach is to use the distribution of the complexes based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (sum over i (K_i [L]^i )).

In this case, [L] is [SCN^-}=0.1 M.

So, for each complex n=0 to 4:

f_n = (K_n (0.1)^n ) / ( sum_{i=0}^4 K_i (0.1)^i ) ).

But wait, n=0 corresponds to the free Co²+.

So,

Compute each term:

n=0: K0 is 1? Because [Co²+] = [Co²+] (free ion). So, K0=1. So, term is 1*(0.1)^0=1.

n=1: K1=9, term=9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

n=2: K2=40, term=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: K3=63, term=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: K4=16, term=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.
