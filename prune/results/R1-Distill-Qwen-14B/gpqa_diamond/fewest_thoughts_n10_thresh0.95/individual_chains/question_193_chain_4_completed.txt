Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says.

The question is about the number of stars varying with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. So the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, or something like that. So if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, I think the exact relation is plx = (1 / d), where d is in parsecs. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes since they appear to move more in the sky as Earth orbits the Sun.

So the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. That would mean N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I can write 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance? But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when you're looking further away, the density of stars should decrease, right? But maybe the way the question is structured, it's considering a specific region where this particular relation holds.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance interval. Or perhaps the total number in a shell between r and r+dr? Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5? That sounds odd because normally, the number of stars within a certain distance would increase with the volume, which is proportional to d^3. Unless there's a specific reason why in this case, the relation is different.

Wait, the question says "in that region of the sky." Maybe this region's density of stars isn't uniform. Like, perhaps in this area, the number of stars is higher and follows this inverse fifth power law. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find how the number of stars per unit volume (or something) changes with distance. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Oh, I think it's asking for the number of stars in a unit distance (like per parsec) interval. So, for a given shell between r and r + dr, how N varies with r.

Wait, but the initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So if plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So for each distance d, the number of stars in a unit distance interval would be proportional to d^5. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think in terms of differential elements.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more precisely. Let's say N is the number of stars in a certain volume. The volume between distance d and d+dr is approximately 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume times the density at that distance.

But according to the question, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in the entire volume up to distance d? Or is it per unit distance?

Wait, no, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So when parallax is smaller (which is when d is larger), the number of stars increases as d^5.

But when considering a shell of thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Because N is the cumulative number up to distance d.

Wait, that's a good point. So if N_total(d) ∝ d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be dN = (dN/dd) * dr = 5 d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (r) would be proportional to d^4.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The question says, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant.

Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5.

So N is the total number of stars at distance d? Or within a certain volume up to d? Hmm, I think I need to model N as a function of distance. If N is the number of stars within a distance d, then N ∝ d^5. But that would mean that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which doesn't make sense in reality because stars become less dense as you go further out. But the question is hypothetical, so let's go with it.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the number in each small range dr, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d.

So if N(d) = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases with d^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. If N ∝ d^5, then the number per unit distance is 5 d^4. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, I thought the question was about the number of stars in a unit range of distance. So, if N is the count per distance, then it's d^4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think about another approach. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. So for each distance d, the number of stars increases as d^5. So for a given shell between d and d+dr, the number of stars would be proportional to d^5. But wait, that's the total number up to that distance, not the number in the shell.

No, wait. N(d) is the total number up to d, so the number in the shell dr is dN = (dN/dd) dr = 5 d^4 dr. So, the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^4.

So the correct answer is C, r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we consider the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness \( dr \) at distance \( d \). This is given by the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dd} = 5d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance interval (\( dr \)) is proportional to \( d^4 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
