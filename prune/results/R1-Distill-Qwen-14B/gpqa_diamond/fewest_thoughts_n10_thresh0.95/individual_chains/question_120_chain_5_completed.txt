Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me think.

Parallax, right, is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, it's the opposite. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a bigger parallax means the star is closer, smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So uniform distribution in space. Wait, but I think in reality, stars are not uniformly distributed; there are things like the Milky Way's disk, but the question simplifies it, so let's go with that.

We need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range (like, per unit plx) changes with plx. So, it's about the density of stars in different parallax bins.

I remember that parallax (π) relates to distance (d) by the formula π = 1/d in parsecs. So d is in parsecs, and π is in arcseconds, right? Because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So π (in arcseconds) = 1/d (in parsecs).

If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their spatial density is uniform. So the number density of stars (n) is constant. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think about the volume. The number of stars in a small volume element depends on the volume. But for a given parallax, what's the corresponding volume?

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the concept of volume as a function of distance. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so higher parallax means closer, lower means farther.

If a star has a parallax π, its distance d is 1/π parsecs. So, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is about 4πd² dr. But wait, since d=1/π, then dr = -d² dπ (because π is 1/d, so dπ = -d² d(1/d) = -d² (1/d²) dd → wait, maybe I should think in terms of differentials.

Let me think in terms of distance and parallax. π = 1/d → d = 1/π. So, if I consider a small change in π, dπ, how does that relate to dd? Taking the derivative, dπ = -d² dd. So, dd = -d² dπ. Considering that d is positive, and as π increases (star getting closer), d decreases. So the volume element in terms of π would involve dπ and d^2. Substituting d=1/π, then d² = 1/π².

So, the volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting d² = 1/π² and dd = -d² dπ = -(1/π²) dπ. So,

Volume element = 4π * (1/π²) * (-1/π²) dπ )

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me rephrase. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr multiplied by the number density n (stars per volume). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant.

But we want this in terms of parallax. So, the shell at distance d has a parallax π = 1/d. The thickness in parallax is dπ. So, how does dr relate to dπ?

From π = 1/d → dπ = -d² dr → dr = -d² dπ / (d^2) → Hmm, wait. Let me re-derive that. So, dπ/d = d/dπ?

Wait, differentiating both sides: dπ = - (1/d²) dd → so, dd = - d² dπ.

So, substituting into the volume element:

dV = 4π d² dr = 4π d² (-d² dπ) ) = -4π d^4 dπ.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the volume between parallax π and π + dπ. For each π, the corresponding d is 1/π. So, the volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. But dd is related to dπ.

Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of π. So, let me define a thin shell in parallax space. The number of stars in a range of parallax from π to π + dπ is proportional to the volume of the shell at distance d=1/π, with a thickness that corresponds to dπ.

So, the volume element in terms of π is dV = 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/π, and dd = - (1/π²) dπ, substituting:

dV = 4π (1/π²) * (-1/π²) dπ) ) → 4π (1/π^4) (-dπ).

Wait that gives dV = -4π (1/π^4) dπ, which simplifies to dV = -4/( π^3) dπ. But since dV is positive, we can take the magnitude, so dV = 4/(π^3) |dπ|.

So, the number of stars in a parallax range dπ is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume). So, n is constant, so the number of stars per unit dπ is (n * 4/(π^3)).

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the number of stars per unit volume is n, so number per volume element is n. So, the number in a shell is n * volume of shell.

So, number of stars in dπ is n * [4π d² dd].

But since d=1/π, and dd = -(1/π^2) dπ, substituting:

n * 4π (1/π^2) * (-(1/π^2) dπ )

= n * 4π (1/π^2) (-1/π^2) dπ )

= n * (-4)/( π^3 ) dπ )

But since dπ is positive (we're considering a small range from π to π + dπ), the negative just indicates that as π increases, d decreases, so volume decreases. So, the magnitude is what matters here.

Thus, the number of stars in a shell at parallax π is proportional to (1/π^3) dπ.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (dπ) is proportional to 1/π^3. So, the number density per unit range of plx is ~ 1/π^3.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, the number per unit of plx (like, per arcsecond) is 1/plx^3.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (\( \pi \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs, such that \( \pi = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). 

Since \( d = 1/\pi \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( d\pi \) by differentiating \( \pi = 1/d \), yielding \( d\pi = -d^2 dr \), or \( dr = -d^2 d\pi \). Substituting \( d = 1/\pi \), we find \( dr = -(1/\pi^2) d\pi \). The volume element in terms of \( \pi \) becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\pi^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\pi^2} d\pi\right) = -\frac{4}{\pi^3} d\pi.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \pi \) increases (closer stars), the volume decreases. The number of stars in this volume element is proportional to \( n \cdot dV \), where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( \pi \) is proportional to \( 1/\pi^3 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\( \pi^4 \): Incorrect. The dependence is \( 1/\pi^3 \), not \( 1/\pi^4 \).**

**B) ~ 1/\( \pi^2 \): Incorrect. The dependence is \( 1/\pi^3 \), not \( 1/\pi^2 \).**

**C) ~ 1/\( \pi^1 \): Incorrect. The dependence is \( 1/\pi^3 \), not \( 1/\pi \).**

**D) ~ 1/\( \pi^3 \): Correct. The number of stars per unit range of \( \pi \) is proportional to \( 1/\pi^3 \).**
