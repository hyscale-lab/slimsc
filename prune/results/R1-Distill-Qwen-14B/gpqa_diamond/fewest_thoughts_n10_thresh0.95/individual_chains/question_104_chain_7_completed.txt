Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and the key information is the periodic shift in the spectral lines of each star.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The amount of shift relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The formula I think is relevant here is something to do with the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the relation between the velocity and the orbital period.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ (2πG) / (P c) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ]

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and M_p sin i ≈ M_p because the orbits are likely edge-on (i.e., sin i ≈ 1). So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets are similar to Neptune. So M_* is the same for both, and M_p is similar too. So maybe the ratio of K between the two planets can be tied to other factors.

Wait the problem says both planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So their masses are roughly the same.

So, let me think about the relation between K and the orbital period P. Since K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet.

The formula for K in terms of P is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/3)

But since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, that's getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of K between the two planets.

Let me denote planet 1's parameters as K1, P1, and planet 2's as K2, P2.

Given that K1 = 5 milliangular and K2=7. So K2 = (7/5) * K1.

But since both planets are around stars of the same mass (M_*) and same planet mass (M_p), the ratio should be K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (P (1 - e²))^(1/3) )) )

Since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and since e=0, the formula simplifies to:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

So, K is proportional to M_p^(1/3) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * 1/( P^(1/3) )

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me re-derive that.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2π / (P c ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should just look for the relation between K and P.

Alternatively, the formula I found online is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to realize that for two planets with same M_p and same M_*, the ratio of their K values is inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital periods.

Because K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)).

So if K2 = (7/5) K1, then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me think again.

If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K2 = K1 * (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me rearrange it.

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → K = A / (P^(1/3)), where A is some constant.

So for two planets:

K1 = A / (P1^(1/3))

K2 = A / (P2^(1/3))

Taking the ratio K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So,

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

We can solve for (P2/P1):

(P2/P1) = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, because taking both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = (P1/P2)

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no.

Wait, let's re-express:

K2 = (A) / (P2^(1/3))

K1 = (A) / (P1^(1/3))

Divide K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

Thus,

P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, not sure if I got that right. Let me compute.

If K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3), then cube both sides:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, yes. So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2)^3

Which would make P2 longer than P1 if K1 < K2. Because (K1/K2) is 5/7 <1, so cube is even smaller.

Wait, but K1 was 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7 ≈0.714.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, wait, but that's the other way around. Because if K decreases, the period increases? Because the shift is smaller when the orbital period is longer.

Wait, wait, the higher the velocity, the larger the K. So if K is larger, the star is moving faster, which could mean a shorter period (since for a shorter period, the planet is closer, so the velocity is higher).

Wait, no. Wait, think about it. A planet with a shorter orbital period is closer to the star, so the star's velocity (K) is higher. Because K depends on the velocity, which depends on the orbital speed.

So, K is higher for shorter orbital periods, assuming same mass.

So, in our case, K2 is larger than K1. So P2 must be shorter than P1. Because if K is higher, the period is smaller.

Wait, but according to the calculation above, P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is shorter, which aligns with the fact that K2 is larger than K1.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈0.364.

Wait, but 0.364 is less than 1, which would mean P2 is shorter than P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the question is how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1.

So the ratio is P2 / P1. Let me compute (5/7)^3.

5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is about 0.714 * 0.714 ≈0.510, then 0.510 * 0.714 ≈0.364.

Yes, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.364 times as long as P1.

So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's around 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter than P1.

The question asks how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1's. So since 0.36 is less than one, it's about 0.36 times as long. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but wait. The options are given as A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, etc. So the correct answer is option A, which is 0.36.

But let me just double-check the logic.

Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K2=7, K1=5.

So,

K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4

So, (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈0.714.

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈125/343 ≈0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36.

Which makes the period of planet #2 about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2 has a shorter period.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So since 0.36 < 1, it's about 0.36 times as long, which is shorter. So yes, the answer is 0.36 times, so option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of ~0.36. Since the question asks how many times longer planet #2's orbital period is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
