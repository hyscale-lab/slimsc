--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about Substance X. It uses a heavier isotope. Common reagents in organic chemistry... Oh, maybe something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7? Those are oxidizing agents. Wait, but the problem says that when X reacts with liquid Y, gas W is released. What could that be?

Gas W: the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be a species where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons (O) and 1 H each, but no, that's not same. Wait, maybe CO2? No. Or maybe H2? No, that's two protons. Wait, wait, wait: the molecule as a whole, or each atom?

Wait, the problem says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for the entire molecule. Let's think about possible molecules. For example, CO2: carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), O has 8 each. The total would be (6+8*2) protons and (6+8*2) neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, each atom has a certain number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, the sum of protons is the sum of each atom's protons. Similarly, the sum of neutrons is the sum of each atom's neutrons.

Wait, the question says gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for the entire molecule, protons = neutrons.

Looking for such a molecule. Let me think: for example, NH3. Protons: 1 (N) + 3*1 (H) = 4. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (since N has atomic number 7, usually 7 neutrons for N-14). Each H has 0 neutrons. So total neutrons would be 7. 4 ≠7, so not equal. Not that.

What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4*1=10. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10≠6. No.

How about H2O? Protons: 2*1 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 0 (H) + 8 (O) =8. 10≠8. No.

Wait, maybe a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Like O2. Let's check: O has 8 protons, usually 8 neutrons for O-16. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16=16, which satisfies the condition. So gas W could be O2.

Alternatively, maybe something else. Let me think: what about nitrogen gas, N2? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that also fits. So W could be N2 or O2 or maybe even another diatomic gas where the atom has equal protons and neutrons.

So the reaction of X with Y releases O2 or N2.

Next, the precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Let's compute what that is. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at 0°C, but just barely. Hmm, what's a solid around that temperature? Maybe something like ice? But ice melts at 273 K (0 C). But the melting point is very close to 277 K, so maybe like 0 C. So B could be solid water (ice), but that's 273 K. 277 is about 4 C. So maybe a different compound. Alternatively, it could be something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, think about what precipitates when a strong base reacts with a salt. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Looking back, perhaps Y is an acid? Because X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, and produces gas. If X is a metal, perhaps it reacts with an acid Y, producing hydrogen gas. But earlier, W could be H2. Let me consider that.

Wait, if W is H2, let's see: the molecule H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons). 2 ≠0, so that's no good. So W can't be H2.

Wait, but earlier I thought of O2 and N2 as possible W. Let's try X and Y reacting to produce O2. What reactions produce O2? Decomposition of something like H2O2, but that's a different scenario. Or, maybe X is a peroxide reacting with an acid. Wait, if Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is something like KClO3 (chlorate), which when heated with an acid produces ClO2 or something else. Hmm, but KClO3 and H2SO4 would produce KHSO4, Cl2, and water. Maybe not O2.

Alternatively, X could be a metal, and Y is water. But metals don't react violently with water unless they're like potassium or sodium. So if X is K, and Y is water, but then gas would be H2.

Wait, but earlier I thought W isn't H2 because protons and neutrons wouldn't match. So perhaps W is O2.

Another approach: the reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point close to 277 K. Suppose G is a carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But B's melting point is 277 K, which is near 0 C. So maybe B is something like MgO, but that's a solid with a higher melting point. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide. When heated, it could lose water and form an oxide. For example, heating copper hydroxide gives copper oxide and water. But melting point of B would be that of the oxide. Not sure.

Wait, the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let me think about substances that melt around that temperature. Water (ice) melts at 273.15 K, which is 0 C. So 277 K is about 4 C. So maybe B is some kind of hydrate. Or perhaps B is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a carbonate, but not sure.

Wait, what about sodium bicarbonate? It decomposes when heated, but its melting point is higher than that.

Alternatively, maybe B is a metal. For example, mercury has a melting point around -39 C. No, that's way lower. Lead melts around 327 C, which is way higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a simple oxide. If X is K, and Y is H2O, then G could be KOH, which is a strong base. But KOH is soluble, so perhaps Y is a different liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a peroxide. Peroxides can react with water, but that might not produce O2. Alternatively, X could be a chlorate, which when heated with an acid produces Cl2 and O2. For example, KClO3 reacting with H2SO4 could produce KHSO4, Cl2, and O2. But the reaction would require heating, and maybe not be a violent reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KMnO4. KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. If it reacts with an acid, perhaps Y is an acid like HCl, which could produce Cl2 gas, but that's diatomic chlorine, which has 18 protons and 20 neutrons per molecule (Cl2 would have 36 each, but I'm not sure if that fits the W condition).

Wait, but earlier I thought W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for Cl2, each Cl has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (Cl-35). So Cl2 would have 34 protons and 36 neutrons. 34 ≠36, so that doesn't fit. So W isn't Cl2.

Alternatively, if Y is H2O and X is Na, then the reaction is Na + H2O → NaOH + H2. Gas is H2. But as before, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. 2 ≠0, so that doesn't fit W's condition. So W can't be H2.

So perhaps W is O2. Let me think about reactions that produce O2. For example, the decomposition of H2O2 (but that's not involving X and Y as described). Alternatively, maybe X is a chloride like CaCl2, and Y is water, but that doesn't produce O2. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So when the keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, which is a keto acid) reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. What kind of reaction would that be? Maybe a neutralization reaction with a base. For example, if X is NaOH, a strong base, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), the reaction would produce sodium acetate (which has more oxygens, but the product would have the same number as the acid? Not sure). Wait, maybe it's an esterification reaction? Or perhaps a dehydration reaction? Or maybe it's an oxidation reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is an oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4 in acidic conditions can oxidize a keto acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when X reacts with the keto acid, it adds two oxygens. Like maybe X is O2, but that's not likely because X is a substance that reacts with Y to produce O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a chlorinating agent. For example, if X is Cl2, but then Y would be a reducing agent. Not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction: X (with a heavy isotope) reacts violently with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons in molecule), precipitate G, which when heated gives B with a melting point near 277 K.

Another thought: perhaps X is Li, a very light metal. But Li reacting with H2O would produce H2 gas, which as before doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, if W is O2, then the reaction of X and Y must produce O2. So X could be KClO3 and Y could be H2SO4. The reaction would be something like KClO3 + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + Cl2↑ + O2↑. But wait, does that reaction produce O2? I'm not sure about the products here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different combination.

Alternatively, maybe X is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but that's a liquid itself, so probably not.

Wait, another approach: look at the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like camphor? Or perhaps a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270 K (which is about -2 C), but that's close. So if B is NaHCO3, then when G is heated, it decomposes. Wait, but what would G be? If G is a carbonate, perhaps it's heated to give CO2 and a bicarbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps G is a sulfate. No, because heating a sulfate typically doesn't release CO2. Alternatively, G might be a hydroxide that dehydrates to form a metal oxide and water. But then B would be the oxide, which usually has a higher melting point.

Wait, maybe G is a salt that, upon heating, releases water and leaves a residue. For example, Mg(OH)2·H2O (magnesium hydroxide monohydrate) might dehydrate upon heating to form MgO and H2O. Magnesium oxide has a melting point around 2800 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the other parts.

The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So the product has two O atoms. Keto acid is something like CH3COOH. If X is a base, say NaOH, then the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has more oxygen. Wait, but the product has two O atoms? No, sodium acetate has three O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is something that adds an oxygen. For example, if X is O2, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, which upon reaction would add an oxygen. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH and X is H2O2, then maybe they react to form RCOO H (not sure). Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is an oxidation. For instance, X is an oxidizing agent that adds oxygen to the keto acid. If the keto acid has a certain number of oxygen atoms, and the product has two more, then perhaps X is O2.

But how does that fit with the initial reaction? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For example, if the keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with an alcohol, but X would be the alcohol, but that seems off because the question states X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analogs. Common reagents include things like NaOH, H2SO4, KMnO4, etc.

Wait, another approach: the product after reaction with the keto acid has two O atoms. So maybe the product is a ketone, which has one O, but that's not two. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydration reaction where two OH groups are removed, but that would form a double bond, not adding oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a chlorinating agent, like ClO2 or something, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, which would have more oxygen. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH and X is an alcohol, then it would form an ester RCOOR', which has more oxygen. But the problem states the product has two O atoms. So maybe the product is RCOOR', which has three O atoms, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O. But the problem says two O atoms. Maybe the product is a diacid or something else.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base like NaOH, and the reaction is neutralization. The product would be a sodium salt of the acid. For example, if the acid is H2SO4 (but that's a strong acid), and X is NaOH, the product would be Na2SO4, which has four oxygen atoms. But the problem says the product contains two O atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the elements in Substance X. The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must have at least two isotopes, one of which is heavier. So X is probably a diatomic molecule or a compound where one of the elements has multiple isotopes.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is a binary compound, like AB, then the lightest element is, say, A with lower atomic mass, and the heaviest is B with higher atomic mass. Then sum their atomic masses.

But what's X? Let's think of possible candidates.

Earlier I thought X might be KMnO4, but that's a solid, not a liquid. But the question says Y is a liquid. So Y is a liquid, perhaps an acid.

Wait, another thought: X could be KClO3. When KClO3 reacts with a liquid like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), a reaction occurs. But what gas is released? In such a reaction, typically Cl2 and O2 are released. So gas W would be O2 and Cl2. But earlier we thought W is O2. So if W is O2, that fits.

So, X is KClO3, Y is H2SO4.

The reaction would be: 4 KClO3 + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + KCl + Cl2↑ + O2↑ + H2O.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like 2 KClO3 + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + K2SO4 + Cl2↑ + O2↑ + H2O. Not exactly sure, but perhaps this is the case.

In this reaction, W is O2. So O2 meets the condition of protons equal to neutrons: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16, so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, W is O2.

Now, the precipitate G would be KHSO4? Wait, no, KHSO4 is soluble in water. Alternatively, perhaps KCl is soluble, so maybe the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a sulfate, which is soluble. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between X (like NaClO3) and H2SO4, producing Cl2 and O2. But again, the precipitate isn't clear.

Wait, perhaps X is not a chlorate. Maybe it's a permanganate. Let's say X is KMnO4. Reacting with H2SO4 could produce MnSO4, K2SO4, MnO2, and O2. But the conditions are probably not liquid Y, and the reaction might not be violent. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide. For example, H2O2. But in that case, Y would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when X reacts with Y (liquid), gas W is released, which is O2. So perhaps X is a metal that reacts with water to produce O2. But I don't think any metal reacts with water to produce O2. Most metals react to produce H2.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide, and Y is an acid. For example, if X is Na2O2 and Y is H2O, the reaction would produce O2. But Na2O2 is a solid, not a liquid.

Alternatively, X is an oxide that reacts with an acid to produce O2. Not sure.

Hmm.

Another approach: think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is likely a solid that melts near 0 C. Let me think of such a substance. Ice is 273 K, but the problem says very close to 277 K, so perhaps it's another form of water, like ice II or something else. Or maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another option: B could be a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) has a melting point around 1340 C, which is way higher. Sodium bicarbonate's melting point is about 270 K, which is close to 277 K. So B is sodium bicarbonate. So when G is heated, it produces Na2CO3 and CO2. So G would be sodium carbonate? No, because heating sodium bicarbonate produces sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O.

Wait, no. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) upon heating decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So if B is Na2CO3, its melting point is much higher. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is NaHCO3. But when it's heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So G would be something that upon heating gives NaHCO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a metal oxide. For example, copper(II) oxide has a high melting point. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a hydrate. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) has a melting point around 33 C. Not close to 0. Alternatively, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 27 C. Not 0 C.

Hmm, perhaps B is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But ice melts at 273 K, which is 0 C, and the question says it's close to 277 K. So perhaps it's a different form of a compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid that's close to melting at that temperature. For example, perhaps it's a different compound entirely, like paraffin wax or something, but that's more about melting points around room temperature.

Alternatively, maybe B is a simple diatomic molecule solid. For instance, solid O2 (oxygen) has a melting point around 54.5 K, which is way below 277 K. So that can't be.

Another thought: if B is a salt that's a hydrate, maybe it's a different kind. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate has a melting point around 24 C, which is 297 K. Closer, but not 277. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a simple oxide, but I'm not getting anything.

Back to the reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce O2. So X is a source of O2. Let's think of X as a compound that, when reacted with an acid, produces O2. For example, if X is a carbonate, but reacting with acid would produce CO2, not O2.

Wait, another possibility: X is a chlorate (like KClO3) and Y is an acid (like H2SO4). The reaction would produce Cl2 and O2. So gas W is O2. The precipitate G would be KHSO4, which is soluble. Hmm, but if G is a precipitate, perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a sulfate and a chloride, but both are soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a metal hydroxide as a precipitate. Let me think: if X is a metal, Y is a strong base. But X would need to be a heavier isotope. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is an aqueous solution of a salt. For example, adding Na metal to a solution of CuSO4 would produce Na2SO4 and Cu metal, but that doesn't produce O2.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide, and Y is an acid. For example, adding Na2O to H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4 and water. No gas produced.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress on the G and B part. Let me switch to the part about the product of the reaction with a keto acid.

The product has two oxygen atoms. So the product must have two O atoms. Let me think of a reaction where a keto acid (like RCOOH) reacts with X to form a product with two O atoms.

Wait, maybe X is a base, like NaOH. If RCOOH (a carboxylic acid) reacts with NaOH, it forms RCOO^- Na^+ and water. The product (sodium salt) has more oxygen atoms than the acid, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. For example, RCOOH + X → RCO (double bond) plus something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: X could be a carbonyl reagent. For example, if X is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid. Some keto acids are easily oxidized. For example, glycolic acid (HOOC-CH2-OH) oxidizes to carbon dioxide and water. But that doesn't fit the product having two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, causing the keto acid to lose water. For example, if RCOOH reacts with something like H2SO4 (which is a dehydrating agent), it could form RCOH (but that's not likely stable) or form an anhydride. Anhydrides have more O, though.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. But the keto acid (like RCOOH) is oxidized to RCOOH (same) or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an esterification. For example, RCOOH + X (an alcohol) → RCOOR' + H2O. But the product (ester) has more O atoms than the acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else that has two O atoms. Not sure.

Another approach: think about the possible options for Substance X. The options given are about the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, possible binary compounds where the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses is one of these.

For example:

- NaCl: Na (23) + Cl (35.5) sum is about 58.5. Not matching any options.

- KCl: K (39) + Cl (35.5) → 74.5. No.

- CO2: C (12) + O (16) → sum 28. Closest is option D)29.

Wait, CO2 is a molecule, but X is a substance that when reacted with Y gives O2. Wait, if X is CO2 and Y is something that produces O2. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a diatomic molecule like O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas, so if X is O2, then Y may be a reducing agent. But the problem says X is a substance that reacts with Y to produce O2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if X is O2, it wouldn't produce O2 again.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound that contains O, and when reacted with Y (like an acid), it produces O2.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then when H2O2 reacts with an acid, perhaps no O2 is produced, but with a base it might decompose into O2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options again: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

If X is CO2, lightest is C (12), heaviest is O (16), sum 28. Closest option is D)29.

Alternatively, if X is H2O, lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16), sum 17. Not matching any options.

If X is CH4, C (12) and H (1), sum 13. No.

If X is NH3, N (14) and H (1), sum 15. No.

If X is NaOH, Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Closest is B)25. Not exact.

Wait, another compound: KClO3. K (39), Cl (35.5), O (16). Lightest is O (16), heaviest K (39), sum 55. Not matching.

Another compound: KMnO4. K (39), Mn (55), O (16). Lightest O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 71. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is HNO3. H (1), N (14), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. No.

Wait, what about X being a mixture of isotopes of a single element. For example, if X is O2, but with heavier isotopes. But then X would be O2, which is a diatomic molecule with same protons and neutrons, but the question says X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a heavier isotope of an element in a compound.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The sum is either 25, 29, 31, or 35.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing H and O. For example, H2O. Sum is 1 +16=17. No. Alternatively, if X is something like HOCl (hypochlorous acid), lightest O (16), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 51.5. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound with elements other than O. Let's think: let's say X is CCl2F2, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, another approach: the sum is 29. Let's see which elements add up to that.

Possible combinations:

- C (12) + O (16) → 28. Close to 29.

- N (14) + O (16) → 30.

- F (19) + something → 29? F + something like 10, but no element has 10.

Alternatively, it could be O (16) + F (19) → 35. No.

Wait, another combination: S (32) and H (1) → sum 33. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substance X is a diatomic element like O2 or N2, but that doesn't fit with the isotopes part.

Wait, another thought: X could be a noble gas, but noble gases are monoatomic, so the sum would be just the atomic mass. For example, Ne is about 20, Ar is 40. Not matching.

Wait, maybe X is a binary compound of two elements, each with atomic masses adding to one of the options. For example, X could be NO. N (14) + O (16) =30. Close to option C)31. Not exact.

Alternatively, X could be C2H5OH (ethanol), but the sum of lightest (C=12) and heaviest (O=16) is 28. Close to 29.

Alternatively, perhaps X is C3H8O (like isopropyl alcohol). Lightest is C (12) and O (16). Sum 28.

Wait, but I'm not getting any sum matching exactly. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements other than O. Let's think about a metal and a non-metal.

For example, Al and Cl: Al (27) + Cl (35.5) → sum 62.5. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options. Let's consider the possible pairs.

Looking at the options:

A)35 → maybe Cl (35.5) and something else. 35.5 + something =35? No, because 35.5 is already higher than 35. So perhaps a lighter element and Cl.

Wait, 35 could be Cl (35.5) minus 0.5, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl (35.5) minus a tiny bit, but not likely.

Alternatively, 35 could be sum of O (16) and Cl (19). No, Cl is 35.5. Hmm.

Wait, another pair: K (39) and O (16). Sum 55. No.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound of two elements with atomic masses adding up to 29.

For example, Mg (24.3) and O (16) → sum 40.3. No.

Wait, maybe X is a compound like NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite). Na (23) + O (16) + Cl (35.5). Lightest is Na (23), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 23 +35.5=58.5.

Not matching.

Alternatively, X could be something like NH4NO3. Lightest is N (14), heaviest O (16). Sum 30. Close to option C (31), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If X is H2O, sum is 1+16=17. No.

If X is CH3OH, sum is C (12) + O (16) =28. Close to 29.

If X is CO (carbon monoxide), sum is 12 +16=28. Close to 29.

Wait, perhaps X is CO, which has C (12) and O (16). Sum 28, which is not exactly any of the options. But the closest higher option is 29 (D). But I thought CO isn't a likely candidate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2. If X is O2, sum is 16 +16 =32. Not matching. If X is N2, sum is 14 +14=28. Close to 29.

But the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so maybe it's a molecule where one atom is a heavier isotope. But for diatomic molecules, the sum would be same as the element's atomic mass times two.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a polyatomic compound where one of the elements is present in multiple isotopes, but that complicates things.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's think of a reaction where adding X to the acid results in adding one O. Maybe X is O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide (O-O), but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is a dehydrating agent, and the product is an anhydride. For example, RCOOH + H2SO4 → RCOO H2S O4? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if the keto acid (like acetic acid) loses a water molecule to form acetaldehyde (which has one O). But that would require a reducing agent. Hmm.

Wait, but the product has two O atoms. So perhaps the product has two O atoms. For example, formaldehyde has one O. Acetone has three O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a hemiacetal, which is a molecule with two O atoms. Not sure.

Another thought: perhaps X is a carbonyl group, but that's not a substance.

Wait, perhaps X is a chlorinating agent, and the product is a substituted acid with two Cl atoms. But that's stretching it.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the cumulative atomic masses again.

The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options. Let's see:

Option D is 29. So possible pairs that sum to 29 are:

- 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) → 29. Cl is about 35.5, so not matching.

- 14 (N) + 15 (P) → 29. N and P? But 14 +31=45.

Wait, no. 14 (N) +15 (O?) No, O is 16.

Wait, 12 (C) +17 (something) → 29. But 17 is the atomic mass of Cl? No, Cl is 35.5. Wait, 17 is the atomic mass of chlorine-35 (which is a stable isotope). Wait, no, chlorine has an atomic mass around 35.5.

Wait, perhaps the sum is considering the exact masses. Chlorine's exact mass is about 35.45. If X contains a heavier isotope of chlorine, perhaps Cl-37.

Wait, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is ClO2, which has Cl and O.

Cl's atomic mass is about 35.5 (average), but if it's using a heavier isotope, say Cl-37, then the mass would be higher.

But how does that affect the sum? Let's think: if X is ClO2, then the elements are Cl and O. Cl is heavier (35.5), O is 16. Sum is 35.5 +16=51.5. Not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substance X is a diatomic molecule where each atom is a heavier isotope. For example, if X is O2, but with each O being O-18. Then, the cumulative mass would be (18 +18) =36. That's option A)35. Close, but not exact.

Wait, another possibility: X is a molecule made of two different isotopes. For example, a molecule of H2 where one H is H-2 (deuterium) and the other is H-1. But that would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of isotopes where the lightest and heaviest are summed. For example, if X is a molecule containing both H and D (deuterium), the lightest H is 1 and the heaviest D is 2. Sum is 3. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of what the options represent.

The options are sums of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is a compound with elements A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, then sum is atomic mass A + atomic mass B.

Looking back, if X is CO2, sum is C (12) + O (16) =28. Closest option is D)29.

Alternatively, if X is a heavier isotope of O in CO2. Wait, but that wouldn't change the sum of the elements because it's still C and O.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements that sum to one of the options. For example, if X is CH3Cl, then elements are C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. No option matches.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with elements that sum to 29. For example, C (12) and Cl (17). But Cl's atomic mass is 35.5. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing Na (23) and O (16). Sum is 39. No.

Alternatively, X is a compound containing O (16) and F (19). Sum is 35. That's option A)35.

Wait, if X is OF2. O (16) + F (19) → sum 35. That's option A.

But does OF2 make sense in the reaction? OF2 is a strong oxidizing agent but I'm not sure about its reactivity with a liquid.

Alternatively, X could be ClF3, but that sum would be Cl (35.5) + F (19) =54.5. No.

Hmm, but the sum of O (16) and F (19) is 35. So option A is 35.

But earlier I thought X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and OF2 isn't a common reagent. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: X could be a compound like CHF3. Lightest C (12), heaviest F (19). Sum 31. That's option C)31.

Wait, but I'm not sure if CHF3 is used as a reagent. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Another possibility: X is a mixture of isotopes of a single element. For example, if X is composed of two isotopes of oxygen, then the sum would be O (16) + O (18) =34. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So if X is a compound that adds one O, perhaps X is O2. But earlier that didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl group donor. For example, if X is CO (carbon monoxide), which can react to form carbonyl compounds. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the product has two O atoms, so perhaps the reaction adds one O. So X might be a monoxide, like CO, which upon reaction adds an O. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should make an educated guess here. Given that the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options, and considering the possible substances, CO2 might fit, with a sum of 28, which is close to option D)29. Alternatively, if X is something like H2O, sum is 17, which doesn't match.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound where the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which isn't an option. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of isotopes of chlorine and another element. For example, if X is Cl2, sum would be Cl (35.5) + Cl (35.5) =71. No option matches.

Alternatively, if X is a compound like NaCl, sum is 23 +35.5=58.5. No.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If I consider X as a compound with elements that sum to one of these.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound of carbon and oxygen, like CO. Then sum is 12 +16=28. Close to option D)29.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound of nitrogen and oxygen, like NO. Sum is 14 +16=30. Close to option C)31.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the problem mentions that X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include KMnO4 (which is a strong oxidizing agent), NaOH, H2SO4, etc.

Wait, if X is KMnO4, then the elements present are K, Mn, O. Lightest is K (39), no, wait: wait, K is atomic number 19, atomic mass about 39. Mn is 55, O is 16. So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 16 +55=71. Not matching any options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound like K2Cr2O7. K is 39, Cr is 52, O is 16. Lightest is O (16), heaviest Cr (52). Sum 68. Not matching.

Another common reagent is Na2SO4. Lightest O (16), heaviest S (32). Sum 48.

Not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a halogen, like Cl2. Then the sum would be Cl (35.5) + Cl (35.5) =71. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule that isn't an element. For example, HCl. H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing F and O. For example, OOF2. Sum would be O (16) + F (19) =35. That's option A)35.

But I'm not sure if OOF2 is a real compound or if it's used as a reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like FCl. Sum F (19) + Cl (35.5) =54.5. No.

Wait, another approach: think about the fact that X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, used in various reactions. So maybe X is an oxidizing agent like KMnO4, but earlier that didn't fit the sum.

Alternatively, if X is H2O2, sum would be H (1) + O (16) =17. No.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. Let me make a guess based on the options. The sum that I think is closest is 28 (CO2) which is near option D)29. So I'll go with D)29.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and determining the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. This suggests W could be O₂ (oxygen gas), as each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making the molecule O₂ have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. This aligns with the condition that the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

2. **Reaction of X with Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce O₂ as a gas, along with a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be a compound that decomposes upon heating, such as sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which decomposes into Na₂CO₃, CO₂, and H₂O. However, the exact identity of B remains unclear.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies that X could be a reagent that adds one oxygen atom to the keto acid, such as an oxidizing agent or a dehydrating agent.

4. **Substance X as a Reagent**: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analogs are also reagents. Common reagents like KMnO₄, K₂Cr₂O₇, or H₂SO₄ were considered, but none perfectly fit the conditions described.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35. Several compounds were analyzed:
   - **CO₂**: Lightest element (C = 12), heaviest element (O = 16). Sum = 12 + 16 = 28, which is close to option D (29).
   - **H₂O**: Lightest element (H = 1), heaviest element (O = 16). Sum = 1 + 16 = 17, which does not match any option.
   - **CH₃OH**: Lightest element (C = 12), heaviest element (O = 16). Sum = 12 + 16 = 28, which is also close to option D (29).
   - **OF₂**: Lightest element (O = 16), heaviest element (F = 19). Sum = 16 + 19 = 35, which matches option A (35).

6. **Final Consideration**: While OF₂ matches option A (35), it is not commonly used as a reagent in organic chemistry. CO₂ or CH₃OH, with a sum of 28, is closer to option D (29). Given the context and the options provided, the most reasonable choice is D (29).

ANSWER: D
