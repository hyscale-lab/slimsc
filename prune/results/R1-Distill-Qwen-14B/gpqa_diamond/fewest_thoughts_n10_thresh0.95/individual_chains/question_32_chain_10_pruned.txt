Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons in total. So, the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion, which is a heavy ion, hence why it's used in colliders like RHIC.

Now, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. So, I'm guessing this is the kinetic energy we're talking about because the rest mass energy is much smaller compared to high-energy colliders.

Wait, but in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but sometimes it's the kinetic energy alone. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or maybe the problem is asking for the total energy (gamma times rest mass energy). I need to clarify.

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

So, v = 0.96c. Let me compute beta (β) as v/c, which is 0.96. Then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me calculate beta squared: 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.571.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. Since it's a lithium-6 nucleus, I should find its mass. I think the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.0160293 u (atomic mass units) but wait, that's from memory. Alternatively, I can look up the exact value, but since I'm simulating this, I'll proceed with what I remember. Another approach: the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So, 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but lithium-6 is charge +3, so it's a triply charged ion, meaning it's lost 3 electrons. Does that affect the mass? Well, the electrons are negligible in mass compared to nucleons. So the rest mass is approximately 5.628 GeV/c².

But wait, precise calculation might require more accurate numbers. Let me think. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the rest mass would be:

3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565 = let's calculate:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So m0c² is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma * m0c². So gamma is about 3.571, so E ≈ 3.571 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.571 *5.6335.

Well, 3 *5.6335 is 16.9005. 0.571 *5.6335 ≈ let's compute 0.5*5.6335=2.81675, 0.071 *5.6335≈0.400 (since 0.07 *5.6335=0.394345). So 2.81675 +0.400≈3.21675. So total E ≈ 16.9005 + 3.21675 ≈20.11725 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the energy given in the options all to four decimal places? The options are A) 18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419 GeV.

So my approximation is about 20.117 GeV, which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but perhaps I should do a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, because when I approximated gamma as 3.571, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - beta² is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: so sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.57143.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So let me compute E = gamma * m0c² again with more precise numbers.

Gamma: 3.57142857

m0c²: 5.633511 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511 = ?

0.5 *5.633511 = 2.8167555.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, which is about 0.07142857.

So 5.633511 * 0.07142857 ≈ Let's compute 5.633511 * 0.07 = 0.39434577, and 5.633511 * 0.00142857 ≈ approx 0.00804.

So total for 0.07142857 is about 0.39434577 + 0.00804 ≈ 0.4024.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈ 2.8167555 +0.4024 ≈3.2191555.

So total E =16.900533 +3.2191555 ≈20.1196885 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher than our calculation. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let's re-calculate gamma.

Wait, beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Now, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2 = 0.0784, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute m0c² more accurately. The rest mass of Li-6: Let me get precise values.

Proton mass (m_p) = 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass (m_n) = 939.565 MeV/c².

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m0 = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Which is 5.633511 GeV/c². So that part is accurate.

Alternatively, I can compute the exact product of gamma and m0c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, m0c² is 5.633511 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this more precisely. Let's break it down:

3.57142857 *5.633511 = ?

Alternatively, use the formula:

(3 + 0.57142857) *5.633511 = 3*5.633511 +0.57142857 *5.633511.

3*5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute 0.57142857 *5.633511:

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, since 4/7 is about 0.57142857.

So, 4/7 *5.633511 = (4 *5.633511)/7.

4*5.633511 = 22.534044.

22.534044 /7 ≈3.21914914.

So E ≈16.900533 +3.219149 ≈20.119682 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is just a little higher. Is there a mistake in my calculation? Or perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, wait! Because sometimes in these problems, the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh, that's a critical point. Let me think again.

In the context of particle colliders, when they state the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per beam particle. Because the total energy (gamma mc²) includes the rest mass energy, but when colliders specify their energy, it's often the kinetic energy. So perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. That would change the calculation.

If so, then the kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m0c².

So let's compute that.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1 = 2.57142857.

Multiply by m0c²: 2.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Again, let's compute this.

2 *5.633511=11.267022.

0.57142857 *5.633511≈ as before, 3.219149.

So total K ≈11.267022 +3.219149=14.486171 GeV.

But 14.486 GeV isn't any of the options. The options are all around 18-23 GeV. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, but then my earlier calculation gave about 20.1197 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). Let me check the exact value.

Gamma is 3.57142857, m0c² is 5.633511 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 precisely.

So:

5.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this as 5.633511 * 3.57142857.

I can use calculator-like steps.

Let me compute 5.633511 *3 = 16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857 ≈0.4023755.

Adding these together: 16.900533 +2.8167555=19.7172885 +0.4023755=20.119664 GeV.

So E ≈20.119664 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but not exactly matching. So perhaps I made an error in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the actual rest mass of Li-6 is different. Let me think. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0160293 u. Because 1 u is approximately 931.494 MeV/c². So the rest mass is 6.0160293 u * 931.494 MeV/c²/u.

Compute that:

6.0160293 *931.494 ≈ let's calculate.

First, 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494, 0.0060293 *931.494≈approx 5.628 MeV.

Wait, 0.006 *931.494=5.588964, and 0.0000293 *931.494≈ ~0.0273 MeV. So total for 0.0160293 is 9.31494 +5.588964 +0.0273≈14.9312 MeV.

So total m0c² is 5588.964 +14.9312 ≈5603.8952 MeV, which is 5.6038952 GeV.

Wait, that's a different value than before. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the initial approach considered each nucleon's mass, but perhaps a more accurate approach is to use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

So Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.0160293 u. So converting that to GeV/c²:

6.0160293 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Wait, 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² = 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.0160293 u * 0.931494 GeV/c²/u.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964 GeV.

0.0160293 *0.931494 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.0060293 *0.931494 ≈approx 0.005616.

So total for 0.0160293 is 0.00931494 +0.005616≈0.014931 GeV.

So total m0c² is 5.588964 +0.014931 ≈5.603895 GeV.

So m0c² is about 5.6039 GeV, not 5.6335 GeV as I previously thought. That changes the calculation.

So gamma is still 3.57142857.

E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.603895.

Compute this:

3 *5.603895 =16.811685.

0.57142857 *5.603895.

0.5 *5.603895 =2.8019475.

0.07142857 *5.603895 ≈approx 0.40203.

So 2.8019475 +0.40203≈3.203977.

So total E =16.811685 +3.203977≈20.015662 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0157 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use beta =0.96 and compute gamma correctly, but perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different reference, like the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, let's re-calculate with the correct m0c².

So m0c² is about 5.603895 GeV.

E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.603895.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603895.

Breaking it down:

5.603895 *3 =16.811685.

5.603895 *0.5 =2.8019475.

5.603895 *0.07142857 = ?

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.603895 * (1/14) =5.603895 /14 ≈0.400278.

So adding them up: 16.811685 +2.8019475=19.6136325 +0.400278≈20.0139105 GeV.

So E ≈20.0139 GeV, which is about 20.0139 GeV. But none of the options are exactly this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.118 higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.603895 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.603895.

Alternatively, use the formula:

3.57142857 = 25/7. Because 25 ÷7 ≈3.57142857.

So, 25/7 *5.603895.

25 *5.603895 =140.097375.

Divide by 7: 140.097375 /7 ≈20.0139107 GeV.

So, E ≈20.0139 GeV.

So approximately 20.0139 GeV.

Hmm, but the option C is 20.132 GeV. That's about 0.12 GeV higher. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160293 u. So 6.0160293 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that accurately.

6.0160293 *931.494 MeV = ?

First, 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.494 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.0060293 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.006 *931.494 =5.588964 MeV.

0.0000293 *931.494≈0.0273 MeV.

So total for 0.0160293 is 9.31494 +5.588964 +0.0273≈14.9312 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +14
