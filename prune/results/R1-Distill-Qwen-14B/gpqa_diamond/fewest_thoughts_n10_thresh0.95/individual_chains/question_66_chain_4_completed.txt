Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. The question is: Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?

The options given are four symmetries: 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. The answer options are combinations of these.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. SMEFT is an effective field theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. I remember that effective theories typically preserve the same symmetries as the underlying theory because those are the ones that are safe to add without introducing new physics that breaks them.

So which symmetries are part of the Standard Model's symmetries? The Standard Model has the gauge symmetry SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but the question is about spacetime symmetries, I think. Or are they talking about other global symmetries?

Wait, the options are about Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Oh, right. Effective operators must respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So SMEFT operators must also respect that. So option 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it's also Poincare invariant because the generators commute correctly, right? Or wait, is Poincare symmetry more about the whole spacetime group, including translations? So if a theory is Lorentz invariant, and the action is translation-invariant (i.e., the equations are the same everywhere), which they are in quantum field theory, then Poincare symmetry is automatically respected. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but wait a second. The SMEFT is built as an effective theory below the Planck scale, so it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry including both Lorentz and translations. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it's built in a way that respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So yes, operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, so 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of the CKM problem and other CP violation effects. So SMEFT operators can violate CP, right? So if the underlying theory violates CP (like the Standard Model does), the effective operators can as well. Therefore, operators in SMEFT may not have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Wait, but wait. Some people might think that SMEFT must respect certain symmetries beyond the Standard Model, but I don't think that's the case. Since the Standard Model doesn't respect CP, its effective theory doesn't have to either. So the operators can have CP violation. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

What about CPT symmetry? The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. I think all Lorentz-invariant theories are CPT symmetric. Because in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must have CPT symmetry. So if the theory respects Lorentz, it automatically respects CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, which is option 4.

So to recap: operators must respect Lorentz (1 yes), Poincare (2 yes), and CPT (4 yes) symmetry. But don't have to respect CP (3 no). So the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. Are Poincare and Lorentz symmetries both required? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. And SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect Lorentz, which implies Poincare? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: Poincare symmetry includes both the symmetry under Lorentz transformations and translations. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect Lorentz, but does it necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it only that the theory is Lorentz symmetric but perhaps not Poincare? No, I think Poincare symmetry is part of the framework. Because the generators of Poincare include both momentum (translations) and angular momentum (Lorentz), and SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory with a well-defined energy-momentum, so it must respect both. So yes, both 1 and 2 are required.

So the three required symmetries are 1,2, and 4. So the answer is option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, looking back at the options. Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So if I'm correct, the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators while preserving the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, is Lorentz-invariant. This symmetry ensures that the theory is consistent under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and respects the broader framework of spacetime symmetries, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as they can include terms that violate CP.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
