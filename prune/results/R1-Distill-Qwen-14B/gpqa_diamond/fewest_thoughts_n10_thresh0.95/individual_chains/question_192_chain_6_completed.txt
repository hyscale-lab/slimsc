Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor has a hole in it, but the hole is entirely within the conductor since r < R. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the spherical conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. But wait, there's a cavity here. So I need to think about how charges are distributed in such a setup.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Then, we placed a charge +q inside the cavity. So what happens here? I think that when a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. 

Let me recall: The cavity is inside the conductor, but it's not touching the conductor's material. So the conductor is a shell around the cavity. When +q is inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, wait. The conductor was initially neutral, so the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to maintain the conductor's neutrality. No, wait, wait. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0, which makes sense.

But wait, is that correct? Because in a conductor, charges can move freely. So any excess charge on the conductor resides on the outer surface. But in this case, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer charges should be zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, maybe the inner surface has +q, and the outer surface has -q? No, that doesn't make sense because the conductor is neutral. Let me think: the charge +q inside the cavity would attract negative charges to the inner surface. So the inner surface would have a charge of -q. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because conductor's own total charge is zero, so (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Now, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the charges on the outer surface. Since +q is on the outer surface, the electric field outside the conductor (at a point P) should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Wait, no. Wait, for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is as if all the charge is at the center, right? So for a point outside, the field depends only on the total charge outside, which in this case is the outer charge +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the outer surface has +q. So from the perspective of a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the outer charge. But because the conductor is spherical, the outer charge is distributed spherically symmetrically, so the electric field at any point outside is as if all the +q is at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the problem is that the cavity is not centered at the conductor's center. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the setup is asymmetric. So the induced charges might not be the same as the simple case where the cavity is at the center.

Hmm, this is where I'm getting confused. Because in the usual case, when a charge is placed in the cavity at the center, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, but the field outside is just due to the +q at the center, so E is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). But in this problem, the cavity is not at the center, so perhaps the charges arrange themselves differently.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is conducting, so the charges should arrange to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. So any induced charges on the inner surface must adjust so that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Let me think: the cavity has a charge +q. The inner surface will have an induced charge -q, but where? Wait, the inner surface is a sphere of radius R, but the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charge distribution on the inner surface is such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material between R and the cavity) is zero.

Hmm, perhaps the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, but positioned in such a way as to cancel the field from +q in the cavity. But wait, the cavity is not centered, so the induced charge distribution on the inner surface might not be uniform. Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the net field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but the conductor's material is a conductor, so any excess charge must lie on the surface. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have a charge -q, but its distribution depends on the position of the charge +q relative to the center of the cavity.

Wait, the setup is that the cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, with l being the distance from P to the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so to find E at P, which is outside, we need to consider the charges on the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, but perhaps the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is affected by the position of the charge in the cavity. Because the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the inner surface must be such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the field inside the conductor (the region between the cavity and the outer surface) must be zero.

Wait, but what about the field due to the induced charges on the inner surface and the +q in the cavity? Let me model this.

The charge +q is at the center of the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius R, centered at the conductor's center, but the cavity's center is shifted by s in some direction. So the inner surface's induced charge is -q, but distributed in a way that when combined with the field from +q, the conductor's material (the region between R and the cavity) has no net electric field.

Wait, perhaps the induced charge on the inner surface is not uniformly distributed. Because the charge in the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge would redistribute to cancel the field in the conductor. But the conductor is a conductor, so the only charges are on the surfaces. So the inner surface has a charge of -q, but arranged so that the field in the conductor's material is zero.

But wait, in the conductor's material (the metal part), the field is zero. So the electric field from all charges inside the conductor must cancel out. So the electric field due to the inner surface's charge and the charge in the cavity must be equal in the conductor's material. That would mean that the inner surface's charge distribution is such that it produces a field that exactly cancels the field from the +q charge, but only within the conductor's material.

Wait, but the conductor is uncharged initially, and the net charge on it is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the +q is at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface is a conductor, the charges distribute themselves spherically symmetrically, so the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, the +q charge is uniformly distributed. So regardless of where the charge in the cavity is, the outer surface's charge distribution appears uniform when viewed from outside the conductor.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform because the cavity's center is offset. But the outer surface would still have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is spherical, and any asymmetry in the inner surface would be screened by the conductor's material.

Wait, no. Wait, if the inner surface has a non-uniform charge distribution because the cavity's charge is off-center, would that affect the charge distribution on the outer surface? Hmm.

Wait, the conductor's outer surface is free to have charges move, but if the inner surface has a non-uniform distribution, the outer surface might adjust. But for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. The charges on the inner and outer surfaces must arrange such that any external fields are canceled.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. The inner surface has a charge of -q, and the outer surface has +q. The outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so if the conductor is spherical, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because any excess charge on a spherical conductor distributes uniformly regardless of the inner charge distribution.

Wait, no. Wait, because the inner surface's charge distribution is non-uniform (due to the off-center charge in the cavity), the outer surface's charge distribution might not be uniform. But wait, no, because the conductor's material is a conductor, and the charges can move freely. So the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But for a spherical conductor, no matter what the inner charge distribution is, the outer surface's charge will arrange itself uniformly. Or does it?

Wait, no. Wait, for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the inner charge distribution is spherically symmetric. But in this case, the inner charge distribution is not spherically symmetric. Because the inner surface has a charge of -q, but it's induced by a charge +q located at a point that's off-center relative to the conductor's center.

Wait, perhaps the inner surface's induced charge is not a uniform -q. Instead, the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the field in the conductor's material is zero. So the field due to the inner surface and the charge +q must cancel in the conductor. But I'm not exactly sure how that would look.

Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution is such that it produces an electric field that cancels the +q's field inside the conductor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in any case, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P is due to the outer surface's charge. Now, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's distributed on a sphere of radius R. So the field outside the conductor should be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L, so the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²).

But wait, the options don't all have L² in the denominator. Let me check the options again.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(l²). Others have l and s and theta involved.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the position of the charge in the cavity affects the outer surface's charge distribution. Because the charge in the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge might not be uniformly distributed. Wait, that can't be right. Because the conductor is spherical, any external charge would cause the outer surface to arrange the charge in a way that the field inside is zero, but for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge must be uniformly distributed regardless of the inner charge distribution.

Wait, no. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, regardless of where the inner charge is. Because the conductor is spherical, so the symmetry ensures that the outer surface's charge is uniform.

So, if that's the case, then the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge on the outer surface was at the center. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, so E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

But wait, the problem states that the center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

So maybe the point P is not along the same line as s. So perhaps the outer surface's charge isn't uniformly distributed, which would affect the electric field at P.

Wait, but wait. If the conductor is spherical, the outer surface's charge must be uniform, regardless of the inner charge distribution. Because the conductor's symmetry is spherical. So the outer surface's charge would arrange itself uniformly. Because any excess charge on a conductor (spherical) in electrostatic equilibrium distributes uniformly.

So even if the inner surface's charge is non-uniform, the outer surface's charge remains uniform. So the field outside would be as if all the charge is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in that case, the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

But looking at the options, option B is one of them.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because the problem gives additional parameters about l, s, and theta. So why are these given if they don't affect the answer?

Alternatively, perhaps the outer surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. Because the inner surface's induced charge is non-uniform, which would cause the outer surface's charge to redistribute.

Wait, but I thought in a spherical conductor, no matter what the internal arrangement is, the outer surface's charge is uniform.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the outer surface's charge distribution is affected by the position of the inner charge. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is neutral, and the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Now, in the conductor's material, the electric field is zero. So the field due to the inner surface and the charge in the cavity must cancel each other in the conductor's material.

But the inner surface is a sphere of radius R, and the charge in the cavity is at a point that's s away from the conductor's center. So the field from the inner surface at a point in the conductor would be the same as the field from a point charge -q located at the conductor's center? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no. Because the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. Because the inner surface's induced charge is due to a +q located off-center in the cavity. So the inner surface's charge distribution would arrange itself such that the field in the conductor's material is zero. But this arrangement might not be uniform.

So, the field inside the conductor (the region between R and the cavity) is zero. So, the field from the inner surface's charge plus the field from the +q in the cavity must be zero in that region. So, the inner surface's induced charge produces an electric field that exactly cancels the field from the +q within the conductor.

But the inner surface is at radius R, and the +q is inside the cavity at a distance s from the center.

Wait, perhaps the inner surface's induced charge is such that it produces a uniform electric field that cancels the field from the +q within the conductor. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electric field produced by the inner surface's charge at points inside the conductor is the same as the field produced by a point charge q placed at the center of the conductor. So, when you add the field from the +q in the cavity and the inner surface's induced charge, the net field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the inner surface's charge as a point charge located at the center of the conductor. So, the inner surface's charge is -q, and the +q in the cavity is at a distance s from the center. So when considering the conductor, the two charges (-q and +q) are in opposite positions relative to the center. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the method of images or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should model the inner surface's induced charge as a point charge located at the center of the conductor. But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, I'll try to think about the electric field outside the conductor. The outer surface's charge is +q, but where is it located? If the conductor is spherical, regardless of the inner charge distribution, the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly, so the electric field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So, point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q)/(L²), which is option B.

But why are the other parameters given in the problem? The distance l, angle theta, and s. Is there a chance that I'm missing something?

Wait, perhaps the charge on the outer surface isn't uniformly distributed. Because the conductor's inner surface has a non-uniform charge due to the off-center +q, the outer surface's charge distribution might be affected. But I thought the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the inner charge, as long as the conductor is spherical.

Alternatively, perhaps the outer surface's charge is not uniform, but then the field outside wouldn't be spherically symmetric, which complicates things.

Wait, but in that case, the electric field due to a non-uniformly distributed charge on a sphere can vary depending on the position. So the field at point P, which is at a distance L from the center, but also at a distance l from the cavity's center, would depend on the distribution.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

The electric field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. For a spherical conductor, regardless of internal charge distributions, the field outside is as if all the outer charge is at the center. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which is option B.

But why would the problem give information about the position of the cavity's center and the point P's position relative to it? Maybe I'm missing a key concept here.

Wait, perhaps the conductor isn't a perfect sphere, but it's spherical. Alternatively, perhaps the charge in the cavity affects the outer surface's charge distribution in a way that depends on the position of P relative to the cavity.

Wait, another thought: the cavity is not at the center, so the outer surface's charge may have a dipole-like distribution or something else, but I don't think so. Because the conductor is spherical, any charge distribution on the inner surface would not affect the outer surface's uniformity.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge on the outer surface is +q, but the field at point P depends on the vector sum of the fields due to all the charges on the outer surface.

Wait, but if the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, then the field at P would still be (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), because uniform spherical charge distribution creates a field that depends only on the distance from the center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the problem in terms of method of images or Gauss's law.

Using Gauss's law: For a point outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor. The total charge enclosed would be the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is (q_enc)/(ε₀), and since flux is E * 4πL², E = q/(4πε₀ L²), which is option B.

So according to Gauss's law, the answer should be B. That makes sense because Gauss's law doesn't care about the internal distribution, just the total enclosed charge. So the answer is option B.

But why are the other options present? Let me quickly glance. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²), which would be the case if the field was due to the charge in the cavity, but that's inside the conductor. But point P is outside, so the field is due to the outer charge. So D is incorrect.

Similarly, options A and C involve l and s, but I don't see how the position of the cavity's center would affect the field outside the conductor if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the field inside the conductor's material).
   - Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain overall neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:
   - For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of the internal charge distribution.
   - The outer surface's charge of $+q$ distributes uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from its center is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Gauss's Law**:
   - Using Gauss's law, the electric flux through a Gaussian surface enclosing the conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed, which is $+q$.
   - The electric field at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor is given by:
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

4. **Relevance of Other Parameters**:
   - The parameters $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ describe the position of the cavity's center relative to the conductor's center and the point $P$. However, these do not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

5. **Eliminating Other Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not on $l$, $s$, or $\theta$.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$ in the denominator, which would be correct if the field were due to the charge $+q$ in the cavity. However, the field at $P$ is due to the outer surface's charge, not the charge in the cavity.
   - **Option B**: Correctly gives the field as $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the result derived from Gauss's law.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
