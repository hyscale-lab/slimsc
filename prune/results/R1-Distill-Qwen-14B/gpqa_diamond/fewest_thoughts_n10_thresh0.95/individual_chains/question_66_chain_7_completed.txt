Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

Symmetries in physics are crucial because they constrain the form of the laws of nature. Effective theories like SMEFT must maintain certain underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have?

The Standard Model (and thus SMEFT) respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if Lorentz is a part of Poincare, then maybe operators must respect both. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that preserves gauge symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, etc.

Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories typically include all possible operators consistent with the underlying symmetries. So the SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So what are those?

The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), and in the Standard Model, C, P, and T symmetries are considered, but not necessarily all. Wait, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, but the Standard Model doesn't have a global CPT symmetry, but individual C, P, T might be violated.

Wait, but in effective theories, the operators must respect all the symmetries of the original theory. So in the Standard Model, the symmetry group is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect these.

What about the symmetries in the question? Let's list them.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, SMEFT operators must respect this because the Standard Model does.
2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Wait, do SMEFT operators respect translation symmetry? Because SMEFT is an effective theory, it includes all possible operators, but the original Standard Model has Poincare symmetry. So I think that SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, Poincare symmetry is about the invariance under spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also be Poincare-invariant. So yes, both 1 and 2 would be required.

Wait, but operators in SMEFT are built from the Standard Model fields. Each operator, being a product of fields and covariant derivatives, must be invariant under the SM gauge symmetries and Lorentz symmetry. So yes, operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes translation. So for an operator to be Poincare-invariant, it must be invariant under translations. But operators are local, so their invariance under translations is trivial because the fields are at the same point. Or wait, no. The operators are terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare transformations. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation-invariant.

So yes, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation-invariant. So Poincare symmetry is required, which means both 1 and 2 are correct. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

What about CP and CPT? CP symmetry is C (charge conjugation) combined with P (parity). CPT symmetry is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal). The Standard Model is not CP symmetric. For example, CP violation is observed in the weak interaction. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP because the SM already does.

Wait, but in the SMEFT framework, how are CP properties handled? The operators are classified as CP-even, CP-odd, or those that change CP. But the SMEFT itself doesn't require all operators to preserve CP symmetry because the SM doesn't either. So for example, operators that change CP could be allowed in SMEFT.

So, do all operators in SMEFT respect CP symmetry? No. Therefore, option 3 (CP symmetry) isn't a must. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So the question is, must all operators respect 1,2,3,4 or not.

Wait, but wait. What about CPT symmetry? In quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. So any valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, and so all its operators must respect CPT.

So looking back at the options:

Which symmetries must all operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Because Poincare includes Lorentz, but Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes translations, etc.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, and CPT. But wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry, including Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait, the question gives options 1 and 2 as separate choices. Let me think again.

The options are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry

2. Poincare symmetry

So if an operator must respect Poincare, then it already respects Lorentz. So if an option includes 2, does it automatically include 1? So in the question, if the correct answer requires the operators to respect Poincare, then why would it include both 1 and 2 in the options?

Wait, perhaps SMEFT allows for operators that don't respect Poincare? No, that can't be. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So operators must be Lorentz scalars, and the entire theory must be Poincare-invariant.

Hmm, but why would the question list Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So if the operators must respect Poincare, then 2 implies 1.

But the question is, which symmetries must all operators respect. So, if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct as well. But the options have 1 and 2 as separate.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. For example, in SMEFT, the operators must be Lorentz scalars, but do they necessarily need to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes not only Lorentz but also translation. For the Lagrangian, the terms are translation invariant because moving the entire spacetime doesn't change the physics. So the Lagrangian density must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation. So yes, each operator (term in the Lagrangian) must be a scalar under Poincare.

So, the correct symmetries that must be respected include both Lorentz and Poincare. Wait, but if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So why would both be necessary as separate points in the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the operators themselves respecting Poincare, but the theory as a whole. Because each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which must be a Poincare-invariant scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, then 1 is also correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if 2 is a correct symmetry, then 1 is automatically correct. So if the options include 1 and 2, but 2 is correct, then 1 must also be correct, making A (1,2) a possible option.

Wait, but the answer options are A) 1,2; C)1,2,4; and so on.

But according to this logic, if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is a must. So if an operator respects 2, it must respect 1. So the question is whether the operators must respect 1,2,4.

Wait, but perhaps the theory as a whole respects Poincare, but individual operators may not. No, because the Lagrangian must be a scalar, so all the operators (terms) must be Poincare scalars.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of an example. The Standard Model is Poincare-invariant. SMEFT is an effective theory that maintains the same symmetries as the SM. So SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant, meaning all its terms (operators) must be Poincare scalars.

Thus, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct, which implies 1 is correct.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if 2 is correct, 1 is correct as well. So if 2 is a correct choice, then the answer must include both 1 and 2.

But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. So is that the correct choice?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about CPT. CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because any quantum field theory must respect CPT. So all operators must respect CPT.

So, the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but 2 is Poincare which includes Lorentz. So the answer would be 1,2,4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2 (so 1 and 2)

C) 1,2,4 

So according to this, the correct choice would be C.

But wait, I thought that the operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So 2 is correct, which makes 1 correct as well. So the correct symmetries would be 1,2,4.

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but what about Poincare. If the operators must respect Poincare, then that's 2, which implies 1. So in that case, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me go through the options.

Option 1: Lorentz Symmetry. Yes.

Option 2: Poincare. Yes, because the operators must be Poincare scalars.

Option 4: CPT. Yes, because all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct combination is 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT because the Standard Model already exhibits CP violation.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model and SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant theories. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since the SMEFT Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare transformations, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included if Poincare symmetry is respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a requirement for all SMEFT operators because the Standard Model already allows for CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to preserve CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT, being a valid quantum field theory, must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore respect CPT symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Since Poincare symmetry implies Lorentz symmetry, the correct combination is **1, 2, 4**.
