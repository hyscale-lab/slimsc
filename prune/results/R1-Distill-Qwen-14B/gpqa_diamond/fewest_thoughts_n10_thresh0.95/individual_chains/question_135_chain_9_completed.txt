Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how important that part is for this particular question. Maybe it's more about the kinematics.

Wait, the problem says what are the kinematically allowed decays. So I'm thinking about conservation laws and the masses of the particles involved. Kinematic allows decays if the energy is sufficient to produce the daughter particles.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So when it decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a decay to happen, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So I need to list all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that can be produced. Let's think about the possible quark and lepton pairs.

Quarks come in pairs like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses are known. For example, up and down are light, a few MeV. Strange is about 100 MeV. Charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom about 4.5 GeV, and top is way too heavy at 173 GeV.

Leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. The electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon about 105 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. Neutrinos have very tiny masses, almost zero.

So the boson X can decay into fermion pairs where their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but the decay products are a fermion and anti-fermion, so each pair's rest mass is 2m, where m is the mass of each. For example, a bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so a pair would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b bbar because 4.5*2=9>6. Same for top quarks, but top is way too heavy.

So let's see each option.

Option A: X→bb, ss, uu, dd, tau+tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, bb has a sum of 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that decay can't happen. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→cc, ss, uu, dd, tau+tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, charm quarks are about 1.5 GeV each, so cc is 3 GeV. That's okay. ss is 2*100 MeV=0.2 GeV, which is fine. uu and dd are even lighter. Tau pair is 3.56 GeV (since each tau is ~1.78 GeV, so two would be ~3.56). That's under 6. Mu pair is about 2*(105 MeV) = 0.21 GeV. Electron pair is negligible.

So for option B, the allowed are cc, ss, uu, dd, tau, mu, e. But wait, what about the top quark? No, because top is way too heavy, X can't decay into it.

But wait, the X is 6 GeV. So let's check each possible pair.

Let me list all possible fermion pairs and their combined mass:

- e+ e-: 0.511 MeV each → total ~1 MeV → allowed.
- mu+ mu-: ~210 MeV → allowed.
- tau+ tau-: ~3.56 GeV → allowed (since 3.56 <6).
- u ubar: each u is ~2 MeV → negligible.
- d dbar: same as u, very light.
- s sbar: each s is ~100 MeV → 0.2 GeV. So 0.2 <6 → allowed.
- c cbar: each c is ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV total. 3 <6 → allowed.
- b bbar: 9 GeV → too big.
- t tbar: way too big, so no.

So possible decay modes are all except b, t, and maybe any others with combined mass above 6.

Looking at the options, option B includes c cbar, which is allowed (3 GeV), s sbar (0.2 GeV), u ubar (0.04 GeV), d dbar (0.04 GeV), tau pair (3.56 GeV), mu pair (0.21 GeV), e pair (1 MeV). So all these are allowed.

Wait, but option B doesn't include the tau and e+ e-? Wait, no, option B does include tau+tau- and e+ e-.

Wait, looking back: Option B includes tau and e, yes.

But option D: X → bb, ss, uu, dd, tau, mu, e. But bb is not allowed, so D is wrong.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible because each t is about 170 GeV, way beyond X's mass. So C is wrong.

Option B has all the allowed except for possibly any I'm missing. Let me think again.

Wait, what about the tau? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so two taus sum to 3.56, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed.

What about charm and bottom? X's mass is 6 GeV.

Charm is okay (1.5*2=3), but bottom is 4.5*2=9>6, so no.

So in the options, only option B and D include charm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Option D: has bb, which is not allowed.

So the correct decay modes are all the fermion pairs except those with sum mass >6 GeV.

So the allowed are c cbar (3 GeV), s sbar (0.2 GeV), u ubar (0.04 GeV), d dbar (0.04), tau (3.56), mu (0.21), e (0.001). So that's all the pairs except b, t, and others heavier.

So the correct option is the one that includes all these.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all these except for the top quark, which isn't even considered here.

Wait, but the Lagrangian given in the problem statement is: L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how the Yukawa coupling affects the decay. Maybe it's about which fermions are coupled to X. But the problem states that the interaction is given, so perhaps all the fermions listed in the options are possible decay products.

But wait, the Lagrangian is written as L = - λ f \bar{ψ} f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa interaction, so X couples to fermions ψ_f. But without knowing the specific ψ_f, perhaps all fermions are possible decay products, so the only limitation is kinematic.

Therefore, the allowed decay channels are all the fermion-antifermion pairs except those where the sum mass exceeds 6 GeV.

So, which options are correct?

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→cc, s s, uu, dd, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except for b and t.

But wait, let me check the masses again. So each fermion pair:

c cbar: 1.5*2=3 GeV → allowed.

s sbar: 0.1*2=0.2 GeV → allowed.

u ubar: 0.002*2=0.004 GeV → allowed.

d dbar: same as u.

Tau pair: 1.78*2=3.56 GeV → allowed.

Mu pair: 0.105*2=0.21 GeV → allowed.

e pair: 0.000511*2=0.001 GeV → allowed.

So all these are allowed.

Thus, the allowed decays are all of these except those which sum over 6 GeV.

So the correct option is B, which lists all of these except the bottom quark pair.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B says X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So yes.

Option D includes bb, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a decay to be allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent particle. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but the focus here is on kinematic constraints.

The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, such as quarks and leptons, provided their combined rest mass is less than 6 GeV. The rest masses of the relevant particles are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For each fermion-antifermion pair, the total rest mass is calculated as \( 2m \), where \( m \) is the mass of one particle. The allowed decays are those where the total rest mass is less than 6 GeV:

1. \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2 \times 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
2. \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2 \times 105 \, \text{MeV} \sim 210 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
3. \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2 \times 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
4. \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{MeV} \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
5. \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{MeV} \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
6. \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2 \times 100 \, \text{MeV} \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
7. \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2 \times 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
8. \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2 \times 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds 6 GeV).
9. \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2 \times 173 \, \text{GeV} \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds 6 GeV).

From this analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), and \( c \bar{c} \).

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
