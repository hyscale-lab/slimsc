Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to think through it step by step. So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They're using the transit method, which I remember is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The key here is that they have limited time, so they want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting.

The question gives me some specific details. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Like, according to Kepler's laws.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they end up with the same size. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about that, but I think evolved stars can expand but in this case, their radii are the same.

Now, the probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on. But wait, the probability isn't just a fixed number; it's calculated based on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (something?), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Oh right, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because a larger semi-major axis (planet farther away) makes the transit less likely. But wait, no, actually, the probability is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller because the planet is more likely to pass in front. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius (R*) to the semi-major axis (a) multiplied by something else? Because I think the exact formula is P = (R_*/a) * (something else). Wait, no, the probability is actually given by P = (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter term. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula is P = (R* + Rp) / a, where Rp is the planet's radius. But Earth's radius is much smaller than the star's, so maybe we can neglect it. So approximately, P ≈ (R_*/a). Because if a is much larger than R*, the probability is higher when a is smaller.

So, the probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis. But wait, another thing: the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, we can approximate a^3 proportional to P^2 * M_star.

Wait, let's write that down. Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_star) * P²) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (P² * M_star)^(1/3).

So, a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3).

Now, the transit probability P_t is approximately R_* / a. Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So, P_t = R / a.

Since a is proportional to (P² M_star)^(1/3), then P_t is inversely proportional to (P² M_star)^(1/3).

Let me write that: P_t ∝ 1 / [ (P^2 * M_*)^(1/3) ) ].

So, for each planet, we can calculate their P_t relative to each other.

Given that both planets have same mass, but let's see:

Planet_1: P1 = P, Planet_2: P2 = 3P.

Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P, P2 = 3P.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, if Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2, then P1 = P2 /3. Or, P2 = 3 * P1. So, if Planet_1 is 3 times shorter, that means P1 = P2 /3. So, for Planet_2, P is three times Planet_1's period.

The host stars: M1 = 2 * M2.

Because Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's.

So, let's compute the transit probability ratio between Planet_2 and Planet_1.

Wait, wait: The question is which has higher transit probability. So, the one with smaller a has higher P_t because a is in the denominator.

But a is (P² M_star)^(1/3). So, a is proportional to (P^2 M_star)^(1/3).

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = ( (P1^2 * M1) )^(1/3)

a2 = ( (P2^2 * M2) )^(1/3)

But P2 = 3 * P1, and M1 = 2 * M2.

So, substituting:

a1 = ( (P1^2 * 2 M2) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( ( (3P1)^2 * M2 ) )^(1/3 )

Simplify a2:

(9 P1² * M2 )^(1/3) = 9^(1/3) * (P1² M2)^(1/3 )

So, a1 / a2 = [ (2 P1² M2) / (9 P1² M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, no, wait: a1 is (2 P1² M2)^(1/3), a2 is (9 P1^2 M2)^(1/3).

So, a1 = (2)^(1/3) * (P1² M2)^(1/3 )

a2 = (9)^(1/3) * (P1² M2)^(1/3 )

So, a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Which is (2/9)^0.333.

But wait, (2/9) is 2/(3^2) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222.

Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08.

So, (2/9)^(1/3) is approximately (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

Alternatively, exact value: 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 9^(1/3) is about 2.08, so (1.26)/(2.08) ≈ 0.606.

So, a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2. So, a1 < a2. Which makes sense, since Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star, so a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, wait: Because a planet with a shorter period (closer in) and a more massive star would have a smaller semi-major axis. So, a1 is smaller than a2.

But the transit probability is P_t = R / a. Since R is the same for both stars, P_t is inversely proportional to a.

So, P_t1 / P_t2 = (R / a1) / (R / a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Wait, because P_t is R/a, so P_t1 = R/a1, P_t2 = R/a2.

So, ratio P_t1 / P_t2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Earlier, a1 is approx 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, P_t1 is about 1.65 times P_t2. So, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, the question says which has higher probability? The researchers want to observe the one with higher probability, so they should choose Planet_1.

But let me double-check the math.

Wait, let's compute this more accurately.

Let me compute a1 / a2:

a1^3 = (P1^2 * M1) = (P^2) * (2 M2).

a2^3 = (P2^2 * M2) = (9 P^2) * M2.

So, a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (P^2 * 2 M2) ] / [ 9 P^2 M2) ] = 2/9.

So, a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Taking cube roots:

a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

Thus a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3): ln(2/9) ≈ ln(0.222) ≈ -1.499. Divided by 3, ln(x) = -0.4997, so x ≈ e^-0.4997 ≈ 0.606. So, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So, a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Wait, no, because a1 is 0.606 a2, so a2 is a1 / 0.606 = approx 1.65 a1.

So, a1 is smaller than a2.

Transit probability is R / a.

Since R is same for both, P_t is inversely proportional to a.

So, P_t1 = R / a1, P_t2 = R / a2.

So, P_t1/P_t2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

We have a2 = 1.65 a1, so a2/a1 = 1.65.

So, P_t1 = 1.65 * P_t2.

So, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to higher probability (~2.25x)

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to higher probability (~1.5x)

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 higher

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 higher.

So, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with 1.65 times higher probability.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher transit probability, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability \( P_t \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \).

From Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto P^2 M_* \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the star's mass. Substituting the given values:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), and its host star has mass \( M_{1} = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 = 3P_1 \), and its host star has mass \( M_2 \).

The semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
a_1 \propto (P_1^2 M_1)^{1/3} = (P_1^2 \cdot 2M_2)^{1/3}
\]
\[
a_2 \propto (P_2^2 M_2)^{1/3} = (9P_1^2 \cdot M_2)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2P_1^2 M_2)^{1/3}}{(9P_1^2 M_2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since \( P_t \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_{t1}}{P_{t2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This shows that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **D)** Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.
