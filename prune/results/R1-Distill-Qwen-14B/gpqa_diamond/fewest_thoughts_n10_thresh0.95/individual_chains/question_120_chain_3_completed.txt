Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in space. So, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, what's parallax again? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is pretty close, right? Because the formula is distance = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs.

But how does the number of stars relate to parallax? The question is about the number per unit range of plx. So when you look at a certain range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their spatial density is uniform. So in any volume, the number of stars is proportional to the size of that volume. But parallax is inversely related to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, so if I imagine a spherical shell at a certain distance from us, the thickness of the shell corresponds to a range in parallax. The number of stars in that shell (and thus in that parallax range) depends on the volume of the shell.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. But since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd) * (plx^2) ). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the shell volume is 4π r² dr, right? But r is the distance, which is 1/plx. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx, because differentiating r = 1/plx gives dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. But since we're taking the absolute value, it's 1/plx² times dplx.

So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The shell volume is 4π r² dr. r is 1/plx, so r² is 1/plx². dr is the change in r, which comes from a change in plx. Since plx is 1/r, dplx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = -r² dplx. But since we're considering positive volumes, dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) → 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me re-do the substitution step.

r = 1/plx → dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. So taking absolute values, dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that gives the volume in terms of plx. But the number of stars in that volume depends on the density. If the density (number per volume) is uniform, then the number of stars is density * volume.

But wait, the density is uniform in space, so it's the same everywhere. Let's denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec). So the number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit range of plx, dplx, is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, the options have 1/plx^4 as option A, but wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for each unit increase in plx, how many stars are there? Or maybe it's the number in a range dplx, which would be N = n * (volume).

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume dV is n*dV. Now, dV as a function of plx.

Another approach: The number of stars per unit volume is constant. So for a given parallax range, we need to find the volume corresponding to that range.

Alternatively, since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, let's consider how the volume changes with distance. At a distance d, the volume element (a thin shell) is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is proportional to Volume, which is 1/plx^4 * dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm looking for the number per unit range of plx. So if dplx is the range, the number is (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4) * dplx. So the number per unit range (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options have 1/plx^4 as option A, but I thought the parallax distribution might depend on 1/plx^3. Did I make a mistake?

Wait wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux or some other factors. Oh, but the question states that the stars are uniformly distributed, so I don't think flux is a factor here. It's just about the count based on distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the number of stars within a certain parallax range. The number of stars at a distance d is proportional to the surface area at that distance, because more distant stars cover a larger area on the sky. But when you're considering a range of parallax (d ranges from d to d+dd), the volume is 4π d² dd.

Wait, but again, d=1/plx, so the volume as a function of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx ). So the volume in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But since each star contributes to a point, the number in that volume is n * volume. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's not matching what I remember. I thought it was 1/plx^3, but maybe that's when considering flux or brightness. Let me think again.

Wait, the surface area at distance d is 4π d². So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to surface area, which is 4π d². But when you look at a range in parallax, you're looking at a range in d, so the number in that range is 4π d² * (dd). But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the number is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

Wait, that gives 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So again, number is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. Which would mean that the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of flux. Oh wait, but the question isn't about flux. It's about the actual number of stars.

Alternatively, consider that when you move to larger plx (closer stars), the same volume includes more stars because the density is uniform. So the number should increase as you get closer, which is correct because 1/plx^4 increases as plx decreases.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing a factor. Let's think about the differential number of stars per unit parallax. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those two plx values.

So N = n * (volume between plx and plx + dplx).

Which is n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 - (1/(plx+dplx))^2 ) * (d d) ?

Wait, no, because the volume between two distances d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd is the change in d for a change in plx.

Wait, let's think in terms of plx. For plx, d = 1/plx. For plx + dplx, d' = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx²) ), assuming dplx is small.

So the volume is 4π [ (1/plx)^2 - (1/(plx + dplx))^2 ] * (dd), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of parallax.

Wait, the volume element as a function of plx is the volume of a spherical shell at distance d =1/plx with thickness dd.

So, since dd = (1/plx²) dplx, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that for the number of stars in space, the flux received decreases with distance, but that's not what this question is about. It's about the count of stars per unit parallax.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the number of stars within a certain distance is proportional to the volume. But when you plot the number per unit parallax, it's the derivative that matters.

Wait, the number of stars per unit parallax dN/dplx would be the number of stars per distance interval (dd) multiplied by the change in plx per distance change.

Since dN/dplx = dN/dd * dd/dplx.

dN/dd is the number of stars per unit distance. Since the density is uniform (n stars per volume), dN/dd is 4π d² n.

But plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

dN/dd =4π (1/plx)^2 n.

Now, dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So,

dN/dplx = (4π n / plx^2) ) * (-1/plx²) ) = -4π n / plx^4.

But since dN/dplx is negative because plx increases as d decreases, the magnitude is 4π n / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx changes as ~1/plx^4, so the answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx},
\]

so the volume in terms of parallax is:

\[
4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
