Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh right, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the numbers.

Let me define v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c. So substituting into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 minus (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 0.14c, which is close. Option D also has 0.14c but maybe it's an approximation.

Wait, wait, 0.1428 is approximately 0.143, so 0.14c is a rounded value. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So E_total = E1 + E2.

E1 is gamma1 * m1c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v=0.6c, v²/c² is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36=0.64, sqrt is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * (2m) c² = 2.5 mc².

E2 is gamma2 * m2 c². v=0.5c → v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Option D has E=5mc², which is 5, but we calculated about 5.96. So the correct E is around 5.96, meaning option C is the one with both v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Maybe I messed up the formula.

The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Plugging in 0.6c and 0.5c. numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 0.7. So 0.1/0.7 = 0.142857... which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (\(E_1\)):
For \(v_1 = 0.6c\), \(\frac{v_1^2}{c^2} = 0.36\), so:

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (\(E_2\)):
For \(v_2 = 0.5c\), \(\frac{v_2^2}{c^2} = 0.25\), so:

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
