--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I remember is around 4 degrees Celsius. That makes me think of water because it's close to the melting point of ice. Wait, ice melts at 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. So 277 K is a bit higher, maybe a solid that's just starting to melt? Or perhaps I'm mixing up some numbers. Let me think—water's freezing point is 273 K, so B's melting point is very close, maybe it's H2O? Or perhaps another substance with a similar property.

Next, the product of a keto acid reacting with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid or similar. When such an acid reacts with a reagent, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of condensation or esterification. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids usually have more oxygen, like in their structure. If the product has two oxygen atoms, maybe it's a simple molecule like CO2? But that's not likely. Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate or another compound, but I'm not sure yet.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope with a higher mass. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog is used. Wait, what reagents are commonly used in organic chemistry that have isotopes? Maybe something like D2O (deuterated water) or perhaps something else. Or maybe it's a metal reagent. Wait, another thought: the reagent could be something like LiAlH4, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing gas W. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule must have the same number of protons as neutrons. Let's say the molecular formula is something like H2O, because H is 1 proton and O has 8, but wait that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 neutrons (since C-12 is common), and CO2 has two oxygen atoms. Wait, CO2 is O=C=O, which has one carbon and two oxygens. The molecule has (1C:6 neutrons) + (2 O: 8 each?), but wait, the molecule's nucleus—no, wait, each atom in the molecule has a certain number of protons and neutrons. But the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, sum up all the protons and all the neutrons in each atom, and those totals are equal.

Let me think of possible molecules. Let's see, H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So protons: 2 H's = 2. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons (since O is 16, so 8). So per H2O molecule, protons sum to 2, neutrons sum to 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CH4? Protons: 4 H's (4) + C (6) = 10. Neutrons: C has 6 (since 12C, 6) and each H has 0. So total neutrons 6. 10 vs 6 — not equal.

Wait, maybe CO (carbon monoxide). Each molecule has one C and one O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 8 =14. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 (if it's 16O). So total neutrons 14. Oh! So 14 each. That fits the condition. So gas W is probably CO.

Wait, but does CO make sense in the reaction? Let me think about the reaction context. X reacts with Y, a liquid, releasing CO as gas. What liquids react with something to produce CO? Maybe if Y is an alcohol or something and X is a dehydrating agent? Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't directly produce CO when reacted.

Wait, another thought: if Y is H2O, and X is a metal that reacts violently with water. But then the gas would be H2, not CO. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, but then the reaction would produce CO2, but we thought CO fits the neutron and proton condition.

Wait, but wait: CO has 14 each (protons: 6 from C, 8 from O → 14; neutrons: 6 from C, 8 from O →14). So that's correct.

So gas W is CO. Then what about the precipitate G? When X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, and forms G and CO. When G is heated, it releases B. And B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius. What solid has a melting point near that? Maybe something like water ice, but ice melts at 273 K. 277 is a bit higher, so perhaps H2O is not it. Alternatively, another compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is something else. Let me think of substances with a melting point around 277 K. Maybe paraffin wax? No, that's higher. Or perhaps something like camphor, but I don't recall. Alternatively, maybe it's ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is solid carbon dioxide, but that's -57 C, which is way below 277 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think: when G is heated, what could produce B with a melting point near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is 4°C. Maybe B is a solid that's just starting to melt at around 4°C. Hmm. Or perhaps it's another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, but metals typically have higher melting points.

Wait, perhaps B is something solid at room temperature but with a low melting point. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrocarbon, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt like NaOH, but NaOH is solid and has a high melting point.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the other parts first.

The product of reaction with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's think about what happens when a keto acid reacts with X. Suppose X is a strong base. For example, if X is NaOH, then a keto acid like acetoacetic acid would react to form a salt. Acetoacetic acid has three oxygen atoms (two from the carboxylic groups and one from the ketone). If it reacts with NaOH, it would form the sodium salt, which would have O in the same way. But the product would have more than two O's. Hmm, maybe X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal such as LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. If a keto acid is treated with LiAlH4, it might get reduced. For example, a keto acid might be reduced to a diol. Let's see: a keto acid has a structure like RC(=O)COOH. If it's reduced, perhaps the ketone (RCO-) becomes RCH2O-, but wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a decarboxylation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is being esterified, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product has two O atoms. So maybe it's something like CO2 or a molecule with two O's. But if the product is CO2, that would imply the reaction produces gas. But the question says the product is formed when the keto acid reacts with X. So maybe the product is something like CH3COO-R, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. Let's think: if X is something like PCl5 or H2SO4, which are used as dehydrating agents. When a keto acid reacts with such a reagent, perhaps it undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. For example, acetoacetic acid could form acetoacetic anhydride. But that would still have more O's than two.

Wait, perhaps the product is something else. Let me think of the possible options. If the product has two O atoms, maybe it's something like an ester with two O's. For example, ethyl acetate has two O's. But how would that form from a keto acid?

Wait, maybe the reaction is esterification. If X is an alcohol, but that's not a typical reagent. Alternatively, if X is a base like NaOH, but then the product would be a carboxylate salt, which has O's in the structure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's go back to substance X. It's used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and especially its analog. Wait, a common reagent in organic chemistry that has isotopes is deuterated compounds. For example, D2O is used as a reagent. So perhaps X is D2O, which is heavy water. Or maybe it's something else with deuterium.

Wait, but heavy water is H2O but with deuterium instead of H. So the isotopic substitution is present. So in that case, X would be D2O. Then, liquid Y could be something else, perhaps an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is D2O, and it reacts with Y, which is a liquid, what would happen?

Wait, but D2O doesn't react as violently as something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium or potassium, which reacts with water or another liquid. But sodium reacts with water to produce H2 gas. So that doesn't fit the gas W being CO.

Wait another thought: the gas W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Earlier, I thought CO fits that, but let's see another possibility. What about O2? O2 has 8 protons each, so two would be 16. Neutrons for O-16 are 8 each, so total 16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in a molecule. So that's another possibility. But would that fit the reaction?

Alternatively, what about N2? Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in N-14. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's another option. But which gas is more likely?

But the reaction in the question is releasing gas W, and the precipitate G.

Wait, if X is a metal that reacts with acid Y to produce a metal carbonyl? That's a possibility, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal reacting with a carbonate to produce CO gas.

Alternatively, let's think of the reaction between a metal and a carbonate. For example, if Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a metal, the reaction would produce CO2 gas. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested CO was the gas, but in that case it's CO2. Let me recheck: CO2 has 12 (C) and 16 (O) each. So each CO2 molecule would have 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. But the count of protons and neutrons: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (for 12C), O has 8 each. So CO2 per molecule: protons =6 + 16 (since O is 8, two O's) → wait no, O has 8 protons each. So CO2 would have 6 (C) + 8*2 (O) = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 8 *2 (O) → same as protons, 22. Oh! So CO2 also satisfies the condition of having equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Because 22 each.

Wait, so CO2 is another possibility for gas W. So what would that imply?

So, if X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate Y (maybe sodium carbonate, but that's a solid, not a liquid). Alternatively, Y might be an acid. Wait, if Y is a carboxylic acid, and X reacts with it, perhaps producing CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, but if X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO2, then the reaction would be something like:

M (metal) + Na2CO3 → MCO3 + Na2?

Wait, that's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the metal reacts with CO3^2- to produce CO2 gas. For example, a metal in a carbonate solution might displace some ions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a stronger metal that reacts with a carbonate, releasing CO2. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a metal that reacts to produce CO2.

But then, the precipitate G would be something else. For example, if X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate solution, the precipitate could be a metal carbonate or perhaps a hydroxide.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal that reacts with water. For example, Na reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But we thought W is CO or CO2. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydride, like LiAlH4, which reacts with something to produce a gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if Y is an alkyl halide and X is a metal, but that would produce a different kind of gas.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a thiol, and X reacts with it to produce H2S gas, but that doesn't fit the proton and neutron condition. H2S has 2 H (1 each) + 32 S (16 each) → protons 2+32=34, neutrons 32 (S-32 has 16 neutrons? Wait, no. S has atomic number 16, so S-32 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So H2S: 2 H (each 1p, 0n) → 2p, 0n. S:16p,16n. So total p=18, n=16. Not equal. So H2S doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let's try to approach this differently. Let's think about what Substance X could be, given that it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry and contains a heavier isotope.

Possible candidates include:

1. D2O (heavy water): used in certain reactions, especially as a solvent or in specific reagent applications. But does it fit the other conditions?

2. LiAlH4: a strong reducing agent, but I'm not sure about isotopes here. It's possible, but not sure.

3. Maybe a metal like Mg or Na, but they usually react with water to produce H2, which doesn't fit the W being CO or CO2.

Wait, another angle: when the product of X reacting with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is something like CH3COOH (but that's the keto acid itself). Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol. So if X is a reducing agent, maybe it reduces the keto acid to a diol. So, for example, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCOOH) might be reduced to CH3CH(OH)COOH, but that's a diol and I'm not sure about the O count.

Wait, the product has two O atoms. So maybe it's a simple molecule like ethylene glycol, which has two OH groups, but that's three O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if a keto acid is deprotonated and loses CO2, but that would leave a ketone. So, the keto acid losing CO2 would produce a ketone. Let's see: acetoacetic acid losing CO2 would become CH3COOH, but that's a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like acetone (propanone), which has one ketone group. So, acetone has three O's. Hmm, but the product has two O atoms. So that's not it.

Wait, another idea: if the product is an ester with two O's. For example, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3, which has three O's. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, which has one O. But that's not two O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible elements in X.

The question also says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X should be calculated. So in X, there are multiple elements, and each can have isotopes. Wait, no: the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So X is a compound, and the elements present are from the periodic table. So, for example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. So the lightest is H, atomic mass ~1, the heaviest is Na, ~23. Sum is 24.

But the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

So the sum must be one of these. Let me think of possible elements in X.

If X is D2O (heavy water), the elements are H and O. H has atomic mass ~1, O is ~16. Sum is 17. Not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate). Then elements are Na, C, O. Na is ~23, C is ~12, O is ~16. So the lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. That's option A.

Wait, but does X fit the other conditions?

If X is Na2CO3, and it reacts with Y (which could be H2SO4, a liquid), then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. The precipitate G might be something else, but wait, Na2CO3 and H2SO4 react to produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. So the precipitate would be nothing; it's a neutralization reaction, so maybe a precipitate isn't formed. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another solution.

Wait, but the reaction between Na2CO3 and H2SO4 is:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

So gas W is CO2, which fits our earlier condition (since CO2 has equal protons and neutrons per molecule—22 each). So that's good.

The precipitate G... but in this reaction, Na2SO4 is soluble, H2O is a liquid, and CO2 is gas. So no precipitate forms. So that contradicts the question, which says a precipitate G forms. So perhaps X is not Na2CO3.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let me think of another compound.

If X is NaOH, then elements are Na, O, H. So lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24, which is not an option. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: What if X is NH3 (ammonia)? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid and I'm not sure it fits the reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. Let's think: if X is a metal like zinc, and Y is a solution of HCl. The reaction would produce H2 gas, but gas W is supposed to be CO or CO2. So that doesn't fit.

Another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. So if G is a carbonate, heating might decompose it into CO2 and a metal oxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possible scenario: X is a metal that reacts with a liquid carbonate solution to produce CO2. For example, Mg reacting with Na2CO3 solution. The reaction would be Mg + Na2CO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + 2NaOH. Wait, but I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces MgCO3 as a precipitate.

Wait, if X is Mg, and Y is Na2CO3 solution, then Mg would react to form MgCO3 precipitate, releasing CO2 gas. So:

Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3↓ + NaOH.

So gas W is CO2, which fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons. Then, when MgCO3 is heated, it might decompose into MgO and CO2.

So when G (MgCO3) is heated, it produces B (MgO) and CO2. Now, MgO has a melting point of around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is 4°C). So that doesn't fit. So B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C. So MgO's melting point is way higher.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another possibility.

What if X is a carbonate salt like CaCO3? If X reacts with a liquid like HCl, it would produce CO2 gas, CaCl2, and water. The precipitate would be CaCl2, which is soluble, so no precipitate forms. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that when X (a metal) reacts, it forms a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of AgNO3 and X is Cu. Then, Cu would displace Ag, forming Cu(NO3)2 and Ag precipitate. But the gas produced would be H2 if reacting with acid, but not CO or CO2.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate. Let me think: If X is Fe and Y is a solution of Na2CO3, then Fe would react to produce FeCO3 precipitate and CO2 gas. So:

Fe + Na2CO3 → FeCO3↓ + Na2FeO4? Not exactly sure about the products, but perhaps FeCO3 is the precipitate. When heated, FeCO3 decomposes into FeO and CO2. FeO has a melting point, but I'm not certain if it's near 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let me think about the heating part: when G is heated, B is released. So G is a carbonate, perhaps, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C, so if B is solid at that point, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, another angle: What if B is a different compound, like ice? Wait, but ice melts at 273 K. B's melting point is very close, so perhaps it's a solid like ice. But how would that form from the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of a substance that exists as a solid at 277 K. Maybe something like solid CO2 (dry ice) but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something that when heated produces a solid B that melts near 277 K. For example, if G is a hydrate, like Na2CO3·H2O, heating would remove the water, leaving anhydrous Na2CO3. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is around 850°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is Na and Y is water, the reaction produces NaOH and H2. But H2 doesn't fit the gas condition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate, which upon heating produces a metal oxide and CO2. But the metal oxide's melting point would be higher, so perhaps B is not the oxide but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. So that can't be.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me try another approach: looking at the product of the keto acid reaction.

The product has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is something like CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), which has one O. No, that's not two. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Wait, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3, which has three O's. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a ketone. For example, acetone (propan-2-one) has three O's. No, that's more than two.

Wait, perhaps the product is a simple alcohol with two O's. No, that's impossible because an alcohol has OH group, which is O and H. So that's one O. Maybe if it's a diol, but that's two OH groups, so two O's. So the molecule would have two O's. For example, ethylene glycol has two OH groups, so two O's. That fits. So the product could be ethylene glycol, which has two O's.

So if the keto acid is reduced to ethylene glycol, then X is a reducing agent. A common reducing agent is LiAlH4. But earlier, I thought LiAlH4 might be a candidate for X.

So if X is LiAlH4, then when it reacts with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid, it would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. For example:

RCOCH2COOH + LiAlH4 → RCH2CH2COOH (but that doesn't seem right; perhaps it's a different reaction).

Wait, maybe the keto acid is something like cyclohexanone carboxylic acid. When reduced, it could form cyclohexanol and release CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is being decarboxylated. Decarboxylation removes CO2, leaving a hydrocarbon. For instance, if the keto acid is CH3COCOOH, decarboxylation would produce CH3COCH3 (acetone), which has three O's. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is not the main product but a byproduct. Alternatively, maybe the product is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), which has one O. No, that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of X as a reducing agent. If X is LiAlH4, then reacting with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid would typically produce the corresponding alcohol. But how does that relate to two O's in the product?

Wait, maybe the product is a different compound. For example, if X is a metal sodium, and the keto acid is reacted with it, perhaps the acid is neutralized, but that doesn't produce a product with two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, which would neutralize the keto acid to form a carboxylate salt. The product would have more O's, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of the possible isotopes in X. If X has a heavier isotope, it's possible that one of its elements is replaced with a heavier isotope. For example, if X is H2O, the heavier isotope would be D (deuterium). So X is D2O.

In that case, when D2O reacts with Y (maybe a metal), but that doesn't produce CO or CO2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but that's getting too speculative.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps X is a solution of a chloride, and when it reacts with Y, a carbonate, produces CO2 gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate such as Na2CO3. Then, Y could be H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2, which fits. The precipitate G would be Na2SO4, but that's soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hydroxide. For example, if Y is Al(OH)3, and X is something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the elements in X. Since the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be one of the options, let's consider each option.

Option A: 35 → could be Na (23) + Cl (35.5), but sum is ~58.5, which doesn't match.

Wait, wait, no. The sum is the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for example, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). So sum is 23 +35.5=58.5. Not an option.

Option B:25 → could be O (16) and F (19). Sum 35, not 25. Alternatively, maybe C (12) and N (14). 12+14=26, not 25. Alternatively, perhaps B (5) and something else. Not matching.

Option C:31 → possible if elements are O (16) and S (32). 16+32=48. No. Or C (12) and S (32) →44. No. Or maybe N (14) and something else. 14+17=31 (N+Cl). So sum is 31. So if X contains N and Cl, the sum would be 14+17=31 (Cl is 35.5, but perhaps the question uses approximate values). So that's option C.

Option D:29 → maybe O (16) and Li (7) → 23, no. Or maybe C (12) and O (16) → 28. Or perhaps N (14) and something else. 14 +15 =29 (N and O). So if X contains N and O, sum is 29. That's option D.

So which option would fit based on X's composition.

Wait, if X is Na2CO3, then elements are Na, C, O. So lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum 35. Option A is 35. But earlier, the reaction didn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is NH4Cl, elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5, not matching any options.

Wait, considering that the product with the keto acid has two O's, perhaps X is a reducing agent like LiAlH4. Let's see its composition: Li, Al, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum 28, which is close to option D (29), but not exact. So that's not a match.

Wait, but perhaps the elements present in X are H and O (if X is H2O or D2O). So lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, what if X contains C and O, like CO2. Then lightest C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28, not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let's think of the possible elements in X that sum to one of the options.

Option D is 29. What elements sum to that? 14 +15=29. So elements with atomic numbers 7 (N) and 8 (O). So if X has N and O, their atomic masses sum to approximately 14+16=30, which is not exactly 29. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's C (12) and O (16) → 28. Close to option D (29), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the question uses rounded atomic masses. Let's think:

Option C is 31. If the elements are C (12) and S (32), sum is 44, which is too high. Alternatively, N (14) and Cl (35.5): 14 +35.5=49.5. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O (16) and F (19): sum 35. That's option A. But earlier analysis didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are B (5) and something else. 5 +26=31 (B and iron? Doesn't make sense).

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

The initial part of the question states that the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two O's. Let's imagine that the product is something like H2O. Wait, but H2O has one O. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's O2, but that's a gas and doesn't fit as a product.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a carbonate. But that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl, like CO. But that's a gas, and the question says it's a product, not the gas W.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, which has two O's from two OH groups. So for example, HO-CH2-CH2-OH (ethylene glycol) has two O's. So if the reaction reduces a keto acid into a diol, then X would be a reducing agent, like LiAlH4.

So X is LiAlH4. Then, the elements in X are Li, Al, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28. But the options don't have 28. The closest is option D (29), but 28 isn't an option. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something else. If X is a carbonate, the sum could be 12 + 16 = 28, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), which has C, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13, not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with the keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let me think of a molecule with exactly two O atoms. For example, formaldehyde (H2CO) has one O. Not enough. Alternatively, ethylene oxide (C2H4O) has one O. No. Alternatively, maybe it's something else, like dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), which has one O. No.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonate ester, but that's not likely.

Hmm. Maybe I should focus on the part about the melting point of B being near 277 K. What substance has a melting point near 4°C? Well, water (ice) melts at 273 K. So 277 K is 4°C. Perhaps B is ice? But ice's melting point is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps B is a different form of water, like a hydrate. For example, ice with some water of crystallization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different solid entirely. Another thought: ammonium nitrate is known to have a melting point around 169°C, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like paraffin wax, but that's more of a higher melting point.

Wait, perhaps B is a salt that's solid at 277 K. For example, sodium chloride is solid below 800°C, but that's way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here.

Let me summarize what I have so far:

- Gas W is either CO or CO2, as they fit the condition of equal protons and neutrons per molecule.

- The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). So B is likely a solid that starts to melt around that temperature.

- The product of X reacting with a keto acid has two O atoms. So the product could be something like ethylene glycol (but I'm not sure how that forms from a keto acid and X).

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a reducing agent like LiAlH4, but that didn't fit the sum.

- The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be one of the given options.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 29.

Wait, but why? Let me think again: if X is Na2CO3, the sum would be Na (23) + C (12) → 35. That's option A.

But earlier, the reaction didn't fit because Y would be H2SO4, which doesn't produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH, but that doesn't fit the product with two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like benzene, but that's a solvent, not a reagent.

Wait, another thought: if X is a carbonyl reagent, like ketones, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes to a metal oxide and CO2. But that doesn't explain B's melting point.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:31.

Wait, 31 is the sum of 12 (C) and 19 (F), but I don't see fluorine in the reaction.

Alternatively, 14 (N) +17 (Cl) =31. So if X contains N and Cl, like NH4Cl, then the sum would be 14+35.5 = 49.5, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think:

The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be one of the options. Let's consider each option and possible X.

Option A:35 → perhaps Na (23) + Cl (35.5). So if X is NaCl, sum is 23 +35.5=58.5. Not 35. Alternatively, if X contains O (16) and Cl (35.5), sum is 51.5. Not option A.

Option B:25 → perhaps C (12) + N (14) → 26. Close to option B (25). Maybe rounded.

Option C:31 → perhaps O (16) + S (32) →48. No. Or C (12) + S (32) →44. No. Or N (14) + Cl (35.5) →49.5. No. Alternatively, maybe F (19) and O (16) →35. No.

Option D:29 → perhaps O (16) + N (14) →30. Close to 29. Or maybe C (12) + O (16) →28. Close to D (29), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are B (5) and something else. 5 +24=29 (B and Mg). So if X contains B and Mg, sum is 29. But I don't see how that fits.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a carbonate like K2CO3. Then the elements are K, C, O. K has atomic mass ~39. So lightest C (12), heaviest K (39). Sum 51, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the information given.

The product with the keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a reducing agent that reduces a keto acid to a diol (two O's), then X is LiAlH4. But LiAlH4's elements are Li, Al, H. Sum of lightest (H, 1) and heaviest (Al,27) is 28, which is not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different reagent. If X is a metal that reacts to produce CO gas, then X might be copper reacting with a carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when X reacts with Y to produce CO, perhaps Y is a carboxylic acid and X is a metal that reduces it to CO. But I'm not familiar with that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl reagent. But I'm stuck.

Given all this, I'll have to go with the option where the sum is 29, perhaps considering that the elements are N (14) and O (16), sum 30. But since option D is 29, perhaps it's another combination.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH, but that's not a reagent in the way described.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal carbonate, like BaCO3. Then the elements are Ba, C, O. Lightest C (12), heaviest Ba (137). Sum 149, which is not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier analysis, the best fit seems to be option A:35, where X is Na2CO3. But the reaction didn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:29.

Wait, another approach: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is 29. Which elements sum to 29? Let's see:

- 14 (N) +15 (O) = 29. If X contains N and O, that would fit.

So if X is something like NO, but that's a gas. Or maybe X contains both N and O. For example, nitric acid (HNO3) contains N and O. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16) or N (14) if considering other elements. But H is lighter, so sum would be 1 +16 =17, not 29.

Alternatively, if X is NH3, elements are N and H. Sum is 14 +1=15, not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with option D:29, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another idea: if X is a metal like sodium (Na, 23), and the other element is oxygen (O,16), sum is 39. Not matching.

Alternatively, if X is a compound containing Boron (5) and something else. 5 +24=29 (B and Mg). So if X is MgB2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Carbon (12) and Fluorine (19). Sum 31, which is option C.

But earlier analysis didn't fit.

I think I'll have to make a guess. The most plausible scenario is that X is Na2CO3, sum 35 (option A), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is something else.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option D:29, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and the keto acid has two O's. Maybe it's a molecule like H2O2. But that's two O's. So if X reacts with a keto acid to produce H2O2, then X would be an oxidizing agent. But H2O2 is an oxidizing agent itself. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something else.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the information given, the correct answer is likely option D:29. But I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (with equal protons and neutrons per molecule), forms a precipitate G, and when G is heated, releases B (with a melting point near 277 K). Additionally, the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Possible candidates are CO (14 each) or CO2 (22 each). CO2 is more likely due to its common production in reactions involving carbonates or acids.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a solid like ice (melting at 273 K), but further clarification is needed.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X might act as a reducing agent, producing a diol or a related compound with two oxygen atoms.

4. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope. Possible candidates include Na2CO3, LiAlH4, or D2O. X must also contain elements whose atomic masses sum to one of the given options (A: 35, B: 25, C: 31, D: 29).

5. **Atomic Mass Sum**: 
   - **Option A (35)**: Suggests elements like Na (23) and Cl (35.5), but this does not align with the reaction conditions.
   - **Option B (25)**: Could involve C (12) and N (14), but this does not
