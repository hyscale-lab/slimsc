Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the setup is a bit complex, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The centers of the conductor and the cavity are separated by a distance s, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, I guess this means that the point P is somewhere outside, and the line from the conductor's center to P makes an angle theta with the line connecting the two centers (s being the distance between them).

Wait, but the conductor was uncharged initially. When we place a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the charges in the conductor? I remember that when a conductor encloses a charge, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the enclosed charge because the conductor was initially neutral. Oh right, because the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the outer surface would be +q, and the inner surface would have -q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is uncharged, but it's enclosing a charge +q. So the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor would have induced charges: the inner surface would have -q (since it's induced by +q inside), and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor's total charge must remain zero (since it was initially uncharged). Wait wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the net charge of the conductor would be zero, but the inner and outer surface charges would be -q and +q.

So, the point P is outside the conductor (since L> R). The electric field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge outside that point—so, in this case, the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the electric field at P would be due to that +q charge, right? Because the field inside the conductor is zero (since it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), and outside, it behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity. So the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric, so the field outside should be the same as if all the charge were at the center.

So, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L²^? Because the charge on the outer surface is +q, and the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L.

Wait, but wait. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the distance l from P to the cavity's center would be related via the law of cosines, perhaps. Let me think: the distance between the centers is s, and the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l from the cavity's center. So, according to the law of cosines, l² = L² + s² - 2 L s cos(theta). But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, but the field at P is due to the outer charge, which is +q, so the field should be as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. So magnitude would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). So option B.

But wait, do I need to consider the position of the charge inside the cavity? Oh, because the charge is placed inside the cavity, but the conductor's response is the same regardless of where the charge is placed inside. Because the conductor's inner surface will adjust to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside is same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is \( r \) (\( r < R \)). A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge \( +q \) to maintain charge conservation. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is \( +q \). Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

The electric field at point \( P \), which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor, is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The position of the cavity's center relative to \( P \) (distance \( l \) and angle \( \theta \)) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Thus, the correct answer is:

**B) \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \).**

Answer: B
