Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet tugs on it, causing the star to move back and forth. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So, same host star masses, same planet masses, but different Doppler shifts observed.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula I think relates K to the planet's orbital period, mass, and the star's mass. I remember the formula being K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3). But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator simplifies.

Alternatively, I recall that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Oh wait, let me think. The formula for K is something like K = ( ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ). Hmm, but I might be mixing up some terms. 

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it becomes approximately:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like) and same star mass (solar-like), the M_p and M_* terms would cancel out when taking the ratio of their K values.

So, K1 and K2 are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Let me write the ratio K2/K1.

K2/K1 = [ ( M_p sin i2 ) / ( M_*^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ) ] / [ ( M_p sin i1 ) / ( M_*^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p and M_* are same for both, they cancel out, so:

K2/K1 = ( sin i2 / P2^(1/3) ) * ( P1^(1/3) / sin i1 )

Assuming the inclination angles i are the same for both (since otherwise we can't compare, but the question doesn't say anything about inclination, so perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both; because in reality, sin i is close to 1 for detected planets because the RV method is most sensitive to edge-on orbits. So, sin i is approximately 1 for both, which would cancel out. So:

K2/K1 = ( P1^(1/3) ) / ( P2^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no. Let me redo that. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). 

Wait, let's think again. Let me say, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3) * (M_*^(2/3)) ) ) but since M_* is same for both, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is some constant. 

So, K2/K1 = (C / P2^(1/3)) / (C / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1^(1/3)) / (P2^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me think again. K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3). Then K2/K1 = (k/P2^(1/3)) / (k/P1^(1/3)) ) = P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) ) 

So,

K2/K1 = P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) 

Which can be rewritten as (P1/P2)^(1/3) = (K2/K1) 

Wait, substituting:

K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1 

Wait, no, let me rearrange the equation. 

We have K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) 

Taking both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 

So, P2 = P1 * (K2/K1)^3 

Wait, no. If K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3), then cubing both sides: (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2. 

Rearranging for P2: P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 

Wait, that can't be right. Let me make sure. 

If K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^1/3, then cube both sides: (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2. 

So, P2 = P1 * (P1/P2) = P1*(K2/K1)^3 

Wait, no. Let me solve for P2.

From (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 

Because:

Multiply both sides by P2 and divide by (K2/K1)^3: 

P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 

Wait, let me double-check:

Start with K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → cube both sides → (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 

Yes, correct. 

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is compared to P1. So, factor = P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 

Since K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So:

Factor = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364 

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Which means, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, planet #1 has a shorter period than planet #2. The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so the period is shorter. The question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. Wait, no, the question is the other way around. Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of
