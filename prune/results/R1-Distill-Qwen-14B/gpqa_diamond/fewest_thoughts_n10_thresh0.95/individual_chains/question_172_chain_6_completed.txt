Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we're talking about the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere, it's related to the temperature. Oh right, because in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the excitation levels of atoms depend on temperature.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I need to use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Wait, I think I got the energy part right. So E_i is the higher energy level, and E_j is lower, so E_i - E_j is positive.

In this case, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio of populations as (n1)/(n2) = 2, I think. But wait, wait, the question says the excitation in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2. So the population in star_1 for that energy level is higher.

Assuming the ground state is j and the excited state is i, then for star 1, n_i1/n_j1 = 2, whereas for star 2, n_i2/n_j2 = let's say, 1. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of excitation between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the ratio of excitation between the two stars. So (n_i1 / n_j1) divided by (n_i2 / n_j2) is 2. Because star_1's excitation is twice star_2's. So (n_i1/n_j1)/(n_i2/n_j2) = 2.

But if we're assuming that the g_i/g_j term is the same for both stars, since it's about the same element and energy levels, then the ratio would depend on the exponential terms.

So let me set up the equation:

(n_i1 / n_j1) / (n_i2 / n_j2) = [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Oh wait, the (g_i/g_j) cancels out. So we're left with exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1))).

Wait, let me think again. The expression for n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), right? So when you take the ratio for star1 and star2, it's (n_i1/n_j1)/(n_i2/n_j2) ) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Since the ratio is 2, set that equal to 2.

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take the natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, wait, the [1/T2 - 1/T1] can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, because when you get a common denominator, it's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ). No, actually, that's not correct. Let me compute:

Find 1/T2 - 1/T1.

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Wait, yes, because 1/T2 is T1/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 is T2/(T1 T2). So subtracting gives (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but in our earlier step, we have:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which equals, substituting the expression:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but that would mean:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any with ΔE. Oh wait, perhaps the energy difference is given, but the options don't have it. So maybe the actual equation is expressed in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE.

Wait, but the question is about the correct form of the equation, so perhaps the correct structure is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some term, perhaps involving ΔE and k.

But wait, the options don't include ΔE, so perhaps the given energy difference is a red herring, and the correct equation structure is what's being asked.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. But looking at the options, none of them have any constants except for ln(2). So maybe the actual equation's form is what the question is about, and the options are the forms of the equation without the constants.

Wait, the question is about which equation gives the correct relationship between T_1 and T_2. So perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by something.

But from the Boltzmann equation, as I derived, the equation is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE, so perhaps ΔE/(k) is a constant in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the constants, just the form of the equation.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But from the equation I have, ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k)] multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So if [ΔE/(k)] is a constant, then the equation would be ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by that constant. But in the options, none include ΔE or k. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is that ln(2) is proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But among the options, the only one matching this structure is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, let me double-check. Because in the equation, the term [1/T2 - 1/T1] is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me re-express the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So this would be the correct structure.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So that suggests that the coefficient [ΔE/k] is 1. But why would that be the case?

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k). The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah, so ΔE/(k) equals 1 K. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that's ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches exactly option D: ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under LTE:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Assuming \(g_i/g_j\) is the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not match the derived relationship between \(T_1\) and \(T_2\).

**Answer: D**
