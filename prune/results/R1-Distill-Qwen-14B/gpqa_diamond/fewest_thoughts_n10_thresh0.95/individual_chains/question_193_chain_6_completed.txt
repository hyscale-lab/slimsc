Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance d in parsecs, so plx = 1/d. So if d increases, plx decreases. 

Wait, so if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let me write that: N ‚àù 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question isn't directly about N vs. d; it's about how the number changes with distance. Oh, right, they're asking about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density or the rate of stars with distance. So I think that means we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. The number of stars per unit distance would be the rate of change of N with respect to d. So dN/dr, which is the derivative of k d^5 with respect to d.

Taking the derivative, the derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So dN/dr is proportional to d^4. 

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, wait, I think r is the same as d here. The question says "per unit range of distance, r." So r is distance. So the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) would be proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait a minute, let me double-check. So parallax (pl) is inversely proportional to distance. So pl = 1/d. Then N is proportional to 1/(pl)^5 = d^5. So N = k d^5. The number of stars per unit distance is the change in N per change in d, which is dN/dd = 5k d^4. So yes, that's proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C, option C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can write \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Thus, \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, \( r \). This corresponds to finding the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), or \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Taking the derivative of \( N = k d^5 \) (where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} = 5k d^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Since \( r \) represents distance, the result can also be expressed as \( \propto r^4 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \sim r^3 \)**  
**B) \( \sim r^5 \)**  
**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**  
**D) \( \sim r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
