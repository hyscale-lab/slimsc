--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with some very small distances, like 1e-15 meters or so.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles decay, and the mean distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the formula for mean decay length is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau), multiplied by the velocity (beta times c). So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

But how do I get tau from the given parameters? Oh wait, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / tau. Because the natural width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but units might be tricky here. Let me think. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because I remember that 1 GeV is about 1.6e-10 J, but wait, maybe I should just stick to the units as given.

So, Γ is given in MeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is around 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's tau.

Now, I need to find beta and gamma. Beta is v/c, and gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). But to find beta, I probably need to use the energy and mass of the particle.

The energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. For a relativistic particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So I can solve for p, the momentum.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So let's compute p.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)². Let me compute that.

E = 8 GeV, m c^2 = 1.2 GeV. So E² is 64 (GeV)^2, (m c^2)^2 is 1.44 (GeV)^2. So (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Wait, because (pc) is in GeV, so p is in GeV/c.

Now, beta is v/c. And for a particle, p = gamma m v. So p = gamma m v. Since v = beta c, p = gamma m beta c.

So, p = gamma m beta c. Let's solve for beta. Let's see, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, but perhaps an easier way is to compute beta from E and m.

Another approach: since E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m beta c.

So, E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) )= 8 /1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.66666..., which is 20/3.

Beta can be found from gamma: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/gamma. So 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400)/(9) ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775): 0.9887 is approximately correct. Let me check: 0.9887 squared is approx 0.9775. Yes.

So beta is about 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887 c.

Now, gamma is 20/3, as we found earlier.

So the mean decay length L is beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is L = beta * gamma * c * tau. Because for time dilation, the lifetime is gamma times tau_0 (proper lifetime), but the speed is beta c. So the distance would be (beta c) * (gamma tau_0). Or wait, tau is the lifetime as measured in the lab frame, which is gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, no, earlier I got tau as the lifetime in the lab frame. Because tau = ħ / Γ. And Γ is the total decay width, which is the same in all frames, I think. Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps in this problem, we can treat tau as the lifetime in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think again: in the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau_0. In the lab frame, it's gamma tau_0. So the mean path length is v * gamma tau_0. Which is beta c * gamma tau_0. So yes, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but tau is measured in the lab frame, right? Because the decay width is related to the lifetime as measured in the rest frame? Let me clarify.

The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau_0 by Γ = ħ / tau_0. So tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0 = gamma ħ / Γ.

So that would make L = beta gamma c tau_0 = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but I think I might have messed that up. Let me think again.

We have:

Γ = ħ / tau_0 → tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

And the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

So the mean decay length is L = v * tau = beta c * tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, tau is gamma tau_0.

So L = beta c * tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So L = beta c gamma ( ħ / Gamma )

But Gamma is given, so let's plug all the numbers.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute L using the given E and m.

Wait, another approach is to compute the velocity beta and gamma, then compute tau (in the lab frame), and then L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's try to proceed step by step.

So, from earlier steps, I think L = beta gamma c tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So putting it all together: L = beta gamma c ( ħ / Gamma )

Wait, let's compute that.

We have beta ≈ 0.9887, gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So:

L = (0.9887) * (20/3) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute the units.

The GeV in numerator and denominator will cancel out.

So, let's compute the numerical value.

Compute the constants:

0.9887 * (20/3) = 0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ 6.6013.

Then, 6.6013 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9804e9 m/s.

Next, multiply by (6.582e-25 GeV·s) → GeV is unit, but denominator is GeV, so units cancel.

So 1.9804e9 m/s * 6.582e-25 s → 1.9804e9 * 6.582e-25 m.

Wait, let me compute this:

1.9804e9 * 6.582e-25 = 

(1.9804 * 6.582) * 1e9 * 1e-25 → 

1.9804 * 6.582 ≈ 13.06.

So 13.06 * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 1e9 * 1e-25 = 1e-16.

So that's 13.06e-16 m.

Wait, but I have to divide by 0.32 GeV. Wait wait, no, because in the numerator, I'm already including the ħ and Gamma:

Wait, the formula is (beta gamma c) * (ħ / Gamma)

So, (beta gamma c) is 1.9804e9 m/s.

Multiply by (6.582e-25 GeV·s) → (6.582e-25 * 1.9804e9) m · (GeV·s)/(GeV) → since Gamma is 0.32 GeV, the division is by 0.32.

Wait, wait, no, I think I missed a division by Gamma. So the (6.582e-25) is multiplied by (1.9804e9) and then divided by Gamma (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let me re-express the terms:

L = beta * gamma * c * (ħ / Gamma )

So, beta gamma c = 0.9887 * (20/3) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, (20/3) *3e8 is 20e8 m/s. Wait, 3e8 m/s multiplied by (20/3) gives 20e8 m/s? Let me compute:

3e8 m/s * (20/3) = 20e8 m/s. So, beta * gamma c is 0.9887 * 20e8 m/s → 19.774e8 m/s → approx 1.9774e9 m/s.

So, 1.9774e9 m/s * (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32 GeV * (1 GeV^-1) → Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute each part again.

Wait, the product:

(1.9774e9 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) 

The GeV units cancel. The s in numerator and denominator also cancel.

So, (1.9774e9 m/s) * (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32 → 

Compute numerator: 1.9774e9 * 6.582e-25 → 

Multiply 1.9774e9 by 6.582e-25:

1.9774 *6.582 ≈13.06; exponents: 1e9 *1e-25 = 1e-16.

So 13.06e-16 m.

Divide by 0.32: 13.06e-16 / 0.32 → approx 40.8125e-16 m. Wait, 13.06 / 0.32 is about 40.8125.

So 40.8125e-16 m → 4.08125e-15 m.

Wait, 40.8125e-16 = 4.08125e-15.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option A is 5.02e-16, C is 5.02e-15, D is 4.06e-16.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.08e-15 m. But option B is 4.0655e-15. So likely option B is the correct one.

Wait, but perhaps my approximations made some error. Let me do the exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me recompute beta more accurately. Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666666... = 20/3.

So beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (3^2)/(20^2) )= 1 - 9/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Well, 0.988^2 = 0.976144. 0.9887^2 = (0.988+0.0007)^2 ≈ 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0007 + (0.0007)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 ≈ 0.97752769. That's very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So beta is 0.9887, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So beta gamma is 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.601333.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So beta gamma c is 6.601333 *3e8 = 1.9804e9 m/s.

Now, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma (width) is 0.32 GeV.

So, the distance L is (beta gamma c) * (ħ / Gamma )

So,

(1.9804e9 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV )

The GeV cancels, s in numerator and denominator (from s in ħ) cancels.

So,

(1.9804e9) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32 → let me compute this.

First, 1.9804e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9804 *6.582) *1e9 *1e-25 → 1.9804 *6.582 ≈13.06 → 13.06e-16.

Divide by 0.32 → 13.06 / 0.32 = 40.8125 → 40.8125e-16 m → 4.08125e-15 m.

Hmm, which is approximately 4.08e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So perhaps I made some approximation in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately each step.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

gamma² = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444444.

1/gamma² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) exactly. Let me compute this more precisely.

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

We can compute it using a calculator approach.

We know that 0.988^2= 0.976144.

0.9887^2 = (0.988 +0.0007)^2.

= (0.988)^2 + 2*(0.988)*(0.0007) + (0.0007)^2.

= 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta ≈0.9887.

Alternatively, I can compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Let me compute using the Newton-Raphson method.

We can take x=0.9887, x²=0.97752769.

But we need x²=0.9775.

The difference is 0.97752769 -0.9775 =0.00002769.

We can compute a better approximation.

Let me let x=0.9887, x²=0.97752769.

We want f(x)=x²=0.9775.

f(x) -0.9775=0.00002769.

We can use the linear approximation:

delta_x ≈ ( - (x² - target) ) / (2x )

So delta_x = ( - (0.97752769 -0.9775) ) / (2*0.9887 )

= ( -0.00002769 ) / (1.9774 )

≈-0.00001400.

So new x is 0.9887 - 0.000014 ≈ 0.988686.

Check x²: (0.988686)^2.

Let me compute 0.988686^2.

It's (0.988 + 0.000686)^2.

=0.988^2 + 2*(0.988)*(0.000686) + (0.000686)^2.

=0.976144 + 2 *0.988 *0.000686 + 0.00000047.

Compute 2*0.988=1.976.

1.976 * 0.000686 = approx 0.001357.

So 0.976144 + 0.001357 = 0.977499 + 0.00000047 ≈ 0.977500.

So x=0.988686 gives x²=0.977500.

So beta ≈0.988686.

So more accurately, beta is 0.988686.

Now, compute beta gamma = 0.988686 * (20/3) = let's compute 20/3=6.6666666667.

So 0.988686 *6.6666666667.

Compute 0.988686 *6 =5.932116.

0.988686 *0.6666666667= approx 0.659124.

So total beta gamma ≈5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

So beta gamma is approximately 6.59124.

Now, beta gamma c =6.59124 *3e8 m/s =  1.977372e9 m/s.

Now, L = (1.977372e9 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV )

The GeV cancels, s cancels as well.

So,

(1.977372e9) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = ?

Compute numerator: 1.977372e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.977372 *6.582 * 1e-16.

1.977372 *6.582 ≈ let's compute:

1.977372 *6 =11.864232.

1.977372 *0.582= approx 1.977372 *0.5=0.988686, 1.977372 *0.082= approx 0.16204. So 0.988686 +0.16204=1.150726.

Total: 11.864232 +1.150726 ≈13.014958.

So 13.014958e-16.

Divide by 0.32 →13.014958 /0.32 ≈40.671743 →40.671743e-16 m →4.0671743e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the mean decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) are given. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2 \), we solve for the momentum \( p \):

\[
(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 -
