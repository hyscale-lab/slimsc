Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Let me go through the details. Both planets are Earth-like, same mass. Planet 1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet 2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. So Planet 1 is orbiting closer than Planet 2.

The host stars are different. Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So more massive star with same radius—does that mean it's younger or maybe has a different structure? But for transit probability, I think the key factors are the star's size and the planet's size relative to the star.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a)), where a is something... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (e)) where e is the eccentricity, but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so maybe that part isn't a factor. Or wait, another approach: the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's distance in the sky, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, another thought. The probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's diameter. No, wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the area that the planet can block relative to the star. So the probability depends on the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. But wait, that's only one part. Another factor is the alignment of the orbit—so the probability is also affected by how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) ) where a is the semi-major axis, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (e)), but since e is zero here, that doesn't matter. Wait, no, I think another factor is the star's radius compared to the planet's orbital distance. Because if the planet is really far from the star, the chance that it passes in front is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transit probability formula more accurately. I think the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / (a * sin i) ), but because sin i varies, the average probability might be (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/a), but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ) )? Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but that doesn't seem to make sense dimensionally.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the geometry. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability of that happening is proportional to the area where the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. So the probability is higher when the planet's orbital radius is smaller relative to the star's size.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I should look for an equation. I recall that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / (a) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but perhaps I'm confusing the formula.

Alternatively, another source I recall says that the probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a))

Wait, but a is the semi-major axis. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher. Because a smaller a (closer to the star) would mean that the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. Because for a given star, a planet with a smaller orbital distance has a higher chance of transiting.

So in this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2, so it's closer to its star. So a is smaller for Planet_1. So higher a would decrease the probability.

Also, the formula includes (R_p / R_s)^2. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are about the same. But wait, the stars have the same radius, right? The question says both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is the same for both. So R_p is same for both planets as well, since they are Earth-like. So (R_p / R_s)^2 is the same for both. So that part is a wash.

But the a is different. So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So Planet_1 has a shorter period, which implies a smaller a. So Planet_1's a is 1/3 of Planet_2's a, assuming that the period is three times shorter. Because according to Kepler's third law, period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by M. So a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3).

Wait, so let's get into the Kepler's law part. For a circular orbit, P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + planet_mass)) * a^3. Since the planet mass is negligible compared to the star, we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) * a^3.

So a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4π²). So a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

So for Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2 (since the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host). P1 is P2 /3.

So a1 = [ G * (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)

a2 = [ G * M2 * P2^2 ]^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)

So compute a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 M2) * (P2²/9) ) / (M2 * P2²) ) ]^(1/3)

Simplify inside the cube root: (2/9) = 2/(9). So (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = 2^1/3 / 3^(2/3).

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2)^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)).

Approximately, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, and 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

Wait, but what's a1 in terms of a2? Let me compute it precisely.

Wait, 2/9 is 0.222... Cube root of that is approximately 0.6, yes. So a1 is about 0.6*a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer in, a is smaller.

So, transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So if a is smaller, P (probability) is higher. So for the probability, since P is inversely proportional to a, P1 = (1/a1) * (R_p^2/R_s^2), P2 = (1/a2)* same factor.

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2. So 1/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) / a2.

So P1 / P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = (9/2)^(1/3).

Calculate (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

4.5 is between 4 (cube root is ~1.587) and 5 (cube root ~1.709). So 4.5^(1/3) is approximately 1.65. So about 1.65 times.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but wait. Because the transit probability formula I'm using is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a). Since R_p and R_s are same for both, the ratio P1/P2 is (1/a1)/(1/a2) = a2/a1.

Which is a2/(0.6 a2) )= 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666..., which is about 1.65 times. So yes.

So the probability is higher for Planet_1. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher chance.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times—no, that's higher.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, \(R_p\) is the same for both. Additionally, the stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), so the \(\left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2\) term is identical for both planets. Thus, the key factor is the semi-major axis \(a\), as the probability is inversely proportional to \(a\).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
The orbital period \(P\) is related to the semi-major axis \(a\) via Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, the orbital period is \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), and the host star's mass is \(M_1 = 2M_2\). Using the proportionality:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 2M_2\) and \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \left(3\right)^{2/3}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1}{2^{1/3}} \cdot 3^{2/3} \approx \frac{1}{1.26} \cdot 2.08 \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1 orbits closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\), we calculate the ratio of the probabilities:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 is closer to its star (shorter orbital period) and has a higher transit probability. Based on the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
