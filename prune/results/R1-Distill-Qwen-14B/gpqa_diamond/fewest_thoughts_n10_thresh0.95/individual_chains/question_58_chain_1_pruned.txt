Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when energy is high. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I should remember what regularization is. From what I recall, regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”places where calculations give infinite results, which isn't physical. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method, then taking the cutoff to infinity in the end.

Wait, but some theories are supposed to be "renormalizable." Renormalizable theories can handle these divergences by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge, right? So maybe they don't require regularization? Or do they still need it but can handle it in a way that the infinities cancel out?

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a renormalizable theory. I remember learning that QED has been very successful because it can handle these infinities through renormalization. So maybe QED doesn't require regularization in the same way other theories might. Or does it still use regularization as an intermediate step before renormalization?

Wait, no. All quantum field theories might use regularization as a tool. But the difference is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories can be handled with a finite number of counterterms, making the process manageable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number, which isn't practical, so they might need different approaches.

But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. That suggests there's a theory that doesn't have these divergences, or handles them without regularization.

Looking at the options:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's a classical theory, not quantum. Oh wait, but the question is about high energies. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum theories because they don't account for quantum effects. But when you go to high energies, you're entering the realm where quantum effects are significant. So maybe the classical theory can't handle high energies without some form of regularization or quantization.

But wait, classical theories don't have divergences the same way. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charge, but those are handled differently. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, regularization is more of a quantum field theory concept. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent loop integrals or other quantum effects. So maybe option D, Classical Electrodynamics, doesn't require regularization because it's a classical theory and doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories have.

But wait, when you approach high energies, you need a quantum theory, right? So if the question is about high energies, maybe the correct theory is the one that doesn't have issues at high energies, perhaps because it's a theory that doesn't require regularization.

Alternatively, looking at the other options: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a non-Abelian gauge theory, part of the Standard Model. It is a renormalizable theory, so it uses renormalization. So it would require regularization steps during calculations.

Superstring Theory is a theory of everything, trying to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories usually don't have the same divergences as point-particle theories because strings have more degrees of freedom and their interactions are different. Strings avoid some of the divergences because they don't have point particles, but wait, do they require regularization? Or perhaps they don't because the underlying theory is different. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, superstring theory might require some form of regularization but perhaps not in the same way as other QFTs.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have any divergences that require regularization, it would be the answer.

Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is a classical theory. It doesn't use quantum concepts, so regularization isn't part of it. It doesn't require regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So when the question asks which theory never requires regularization, it's probably D.

Wait, but what about when you try to quantize it
