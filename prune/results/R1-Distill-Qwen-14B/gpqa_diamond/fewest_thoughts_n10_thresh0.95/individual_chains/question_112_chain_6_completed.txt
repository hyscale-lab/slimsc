Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: Let |alpha> be the state of an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Then, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix form of this operator has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, let me get this straight. So, the state |alpha> is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>. But it's proportional, so I guess I'll need to normalize it first. Because probabilities need to sum to 1.

First Step: Normalize the state |alpha>.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write this as a vector in the basis |up>, |down>. So, the coefficients are (1+i) for up, and (2 - i) for down.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So, |1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. |2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Second part: The operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. Wait, what's the matrix size here? Since it's a spin-½ system, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix. So, A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

So, the matrix looks like this:
[ 0,   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are A_11 = 0, A_22 =0. The off-diagonal are A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So, the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, this is (hbar/2) X.

But wait, X is a Hermitian matrix, right? So the operator is Hermitian because it's proportional to a Hermitian matrix. That makes sense because an observable must be Hermitian.

But wait, the operator is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j. So, that's correct.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. But let me remember that these are different from the |up> and |down> which are along z. So, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, and the operator A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2 * sqrt( something? Wait, the eigenvalues of X are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2) * (±1) => ± hbar/2.

Wait, no: X has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So, since A = (hbar/2) X, then the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes in the corresponding eigenstates.

Wait, but wait a second. The state |alpha> is in the z-basis. The operator's eigenstates are in the x-basis. So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, or alternatively, compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the expectation value using the matrix representation. But let me think about how to proceed.

Wait, the problem says to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of operator A. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are |<+x | alpha>|^2 and |<-x | alpha>|^2.

So, first, I need to find the expressions for |+x> and |-x>.

The standard eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

|-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> )

Is that right? Wait, no, Pauli X swaps |up> and |down>, so its eigenstates are superpositions. Let me double-check.

Yes, for the X eigenstates:

X|+x> = +1 * |+x>
X|+x> would be X acting on (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down> ) -> (1/sqrt(2))(|down> + |up> ) = same as |+x>, so eigenvalue +1.

Similarly, X acting on | -x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) gives (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = -| -x> , so eigenvalue -1.

So, right.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down> )/sqrt(2)

So, now, the state |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So, to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2, which corresponds to |+x>, we compute | <+x | alpha > |^2.

Similarly for |-x>.

Let me compute <+x | alpha>:

 <+x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 - i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, no: Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) multiplied by each term in |alpha>.

So,

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 - i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 - i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> = 1, <down|up> =0, <up|down> =0, <down|down> =1.

So this simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 - i)*0 + (1+i)*0 + (2 - i)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So, <+x | alpha> = 3 / sqrt(14) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) is 1/sqrt(14). So yes.

So, the inner product is 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857...

Similarly, compute the inner product for |-x>.

 <+x | alpha> is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is 9/14.

Now, the other eigenstate is |-x>, so compute < -x | alpha>:

 < -x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, <up|up> =1, <down|up>=0, <up|down>=0, <down|down>=1.

So,

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*0 + (1+i)*0 - (2 -i)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1-2) + (i +i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ -1 + 2i ]

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait: the sum is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5). So, the square is 5/(14).

Wait, but probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. That's correct.

So, the probabilities when measuring the operator A are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (for +hbar/2) and 5/14≈0.35714 (for -hbar/2).

Wait, but let's look at the options. The first options list probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36, which would sum to 1.00. Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So that would match the first option, option A, which says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, what about the average value of the operator? The expectation value <A> is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So, eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, <A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] * hbar/2 = (4/14) (hbar/2) = (2/7) hbar/2 = hbar/(7).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:

(9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2) ) = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7) (hbar/2) ) = (2 hbar )/(14) ) = hbar/7.

So, the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but other options have different averages. Let me look again. Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

So, that would match.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that the probabilities were 9/14 (~0.642857) and 5/14 (~0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36 are the rounded numbers.

So, the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, let me check for any possible mistakes in my calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the inner product for | -x >.

Wait, in the < -x | alpha > calculation, I have:

(1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Which is (1 + i) - (2 -i )= (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So, the complex number is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So, |< -x | alpha > |^2 is 5/14, which is correct.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 (~0.64) and 0.3571 (~0.36).

So, the options seem to match option A.

But wait, let me check the other parts. Did I make a mistake in the normalization?

The initial state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 is 2. |2 -i|^2 is 4 +1=5. Sum is 7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), correct.

So, |alpha> is correctly normalized.

Another approach: Alternatively, perhaps the operator's matrix is being considered, and perhaps I can compute the expectation value using matrix multiplication.

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0 ]].

The state |alpha> is a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

To compute <A>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>, which is the expectation value.

So, let's compute it.

First, compute <alpha| : it's [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply <alpha| A:

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So,

<alpha| A = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) * 0 + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2), ... ]
Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute matrix multiplication step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

But perhaps it's easier to compute as:

Compute A |alpha> first.

A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * |alpha> vector.

So, A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Because, for a 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], when you multiply by a vector [a; b], you get [b; a].

So, A |alpha> is (hbar/2) * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of <alpha| and A |alpha>.

Which is (1/sqrt(7)) (1 - i, 2 + i) multiplied by ( (hbar/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

So,

= (hbar/(2 *7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So, <A> = (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the average is hbar/7.

So, the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is "0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7". So that's exactly what we found.

But hold on, the first part is about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So, the operator A has two eigenstates, and the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which round to 0.64 and 0.36.

So, the correct option is A.


The problem involves finding the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and the average value of \( A \) for a given quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \). The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation where \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is calculated as:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Compute probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are given by \( P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \) and \( P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \).

#### For \( |+x\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### For \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
