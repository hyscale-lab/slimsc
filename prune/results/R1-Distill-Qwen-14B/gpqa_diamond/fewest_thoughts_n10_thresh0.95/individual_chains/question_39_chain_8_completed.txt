Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, nowhere else. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since in this case, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the probability is 1 (or 100%) in that interval. So the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must be 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, to find the probability density, I need to compute the modulus squared of this. The modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), but when squared, it becomes a² + b². Oh, right, so |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, let me write that correctly. The wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A - iB, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. Then |ψ|² is A² + B². So, [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So that's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

But wait a second, let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, that's a complex wave function. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function's modulus squared is the probability density. So, that part is correct.

So, the integral ∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral. Let's split it into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx and the integral of 0.25 dx.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to 3. So, a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So, the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ let's compute 0.5 ÷ 0.693. 0.5 ÷ 0.693 ≈ 0.7213.

So, a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that. Let's compute sqrt(0.7213). Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, since 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Oh, wait, wait. Let me check:

0.85² = 0.7225. But 0.7213 is just a bit less than 0.7225. So sqrt(0.7213) is around 0.849 or 0.85, perhaps a bit less. Let's compute 0.848 squared: 0.848 * 0.848. Let's see, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, 0.04 * 0.8 * 2 = 0.064, 0.008² is 0.000064, wait, maybe it's easier to compute 848 * 848. Wait, no, perhaps I should just approximate.

Wait, 0.848^2 = (0.8 + 0.048)^2 = 0.64 + 2*(0.8)(0.048) + 0.048^2. 2 * 0.8 * 0.048 = 0.0768. 0.048^2 is 0.002304. So total is 0.64 + 0.0768 = 0.7168, plus 0.002304 is 0.7191. Hmm, but our a² is approximately 0.7213. So 0.848 squared is 0.7191, which is a bit less than 0.7213.

So, let's compute 0.849^2: 0.849 * 0.849.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.7213^(0.5). Let's think, 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is just a bit higher than 0.7213, so a should be just a little less than 0.85. So a ≈ 0.848, perhaps.

Wait, but 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is 0.0012 higher than 0.7213. So 0.85 is a bit higher than the required a. So perhaps a is approximately 0.849.

Wait, but let me see the options. The options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

Wait, B is 0.85. But according to our calculation, a is about 0.849, which is very close to 0.85. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Okay. So the square of the modulus is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. That's correct.

Then the integral from 1 to 3 of that is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.25*(2) = a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Yes, so a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, the closest is 0.85, which is option B. So that's the answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is proportional to the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since all particles are found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability in this interval must equal 1. Thus, we compute the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2) \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5 \)

Adding these results, the total integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
