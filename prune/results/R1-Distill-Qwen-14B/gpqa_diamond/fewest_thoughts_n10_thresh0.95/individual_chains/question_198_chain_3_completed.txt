Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of complexes. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it's harder to dissociate. Each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think: β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN)_1^+ maybe? Or wait, maybe each β is for a different number of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}? Or wait, maybe the charge is different. Cobalt II is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So adding n SCN- would give a complex with charge 2 - n. So for n=1, the complex would be Co(SCN)^(2-1) = Co(SCN)^+? Hmm, maybe not, because Co^2+ + SCN^- would form [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2+ + (-1) = +1). Yeah, that makes sense.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes. That suggests two SCN- ligands. Wait, no, di usually means two. So dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0? Wait, no, wait. Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be Co(SCN)_2. The charge would be 2+ - 2*(1-) = 0. So the complex would be neutral. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2], neutral.

But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands. So the complex we're interested in is [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, with β2=40.

Wait, no, I'm not exactly sure about the colors, but I think the problem is specifically asking about the species with two SCN- ligands, so the β2 corresponds to that complex.

So the main thing is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

But wait, I think all the complexes are possible, and each has a certain concentration. So the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the individual complex concentrations. The problem gives the total Co concentration as 0.01 M.

So, let me denote the concentration of each complex as follows:

Let’s define:
[Co] = [Co^2+] (the free ion)
[CoSCN] = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] (n=1, β1=9)
[Co(SCN)_2] = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^{0} ] (n=2, β2=40)
[Co(SCN)_3] = [ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ] (n=3, β3=63)
[Co(SCN)_4] = [ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} ] (n=4, β4=16)
 
The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these:

c_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = 0.01 M.

But wait, the SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M. So the total SCN- includes all the free SCN- and the one bound in the complexes.

But calculating that might complicate things, because each complex consumes a certain number of SCN- ions. However, perhaps the solution assumes that the concentration of SCN- is so high that the free [SCN^-] is approximately equal to the given 0.1 M. Or maybe not, depending on how the complexes form.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total [Co], which is 0.01 M. Because each Co can bind up to four SCN-, but 4*0.01=0.04, which is less than 0.1. So the free [SCN^-] would be approximately 0.1 - (0.04) = 0.06 M? Or maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: The formation of the complexes is governed by the stability constants. The higher β complexes are more favored. So the higher β's will have higher concentrations.

But since the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which has β2=40, I need to calculate the fraction of that species out of all species.

But how do I approach this? Maybe using the method of successive approximations or the formation of step-wise complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of conditional formation constants. Or maybe using the distribution of the complexes based on their stability constants.

I think the way to approach this is to consider the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion. But since the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is significant, it's not negligible.

Wait, the general approach is to consider the distribution of the metal among its complexes, based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_m [Co] [SCN^-]^m) for m=0 to 4 )

Where m is the number of ligands in the complex. Wait, but [Co] is the concentration of free Co^2+.

But wait, the free Co^2+ is [Co], and the complexes are formed by adding n SCN^- ions. So,

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co][SCN^-]^n

But the total [Co] (free) plus all the complexes must equal 0.01 M.

But this seems complicated because [Co] is part of the equation in each term.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an assumption that [Co] is much smaller than the concentration of SCN^- (0.1 M), so [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

Wait, the total amount of Co is 0.01 M, and each Co can bind up to four SCN^-, so total bound SCN^- is 0.01 *4 = 0.04 M. The free SCN^- would be 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M. So, maybe [SCN^-] is approximately 0.06 M. But wait, that's assuming all complexes are formed, which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the ligand concentration is so high that the free SCN^- is approximately 0.1 M, and the change due to complex formation is negligible. But in this case, with 0.01 M Co, each Co can take up 4 SCN^-, so 0.04 M consumed, leaving 0.06 M. Hmm, so perhaps [SCN^-] is about 0.06 M.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the fraction of each complex relative to each other.

The fraction of each complex can be approximated by considering the relative contributions of each β and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_m [SCN^-]^m) )

Because [Co] is a common factor in all terms and can be canceled out when taking the ratio.

Wait, because the equation for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co][SCN^-]^n.

The total concentration is sum over n of [Co(SCN)_n] + [Co] = 0.01 M.

But [Co] is (total concentration) - sum [Co(SCN)_n].

But if [SCN^-] is high, perhaps [Co] is negligible compared to the sum of the complexes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the fractions of each complex relative to each other based on [β_n (SCN^-)^n].

So, for each n, compute the term β_n * (SCN^-)^n, then sum all terms. The fraction for each complex is their term divided by the total sum.

Wait, but wait. Let's define:

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co][SCN^-]^n.

So the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n] to [Co(SCN)_m] is (β_n / β_m) * ( [SCN^-]^n / [SCN^-]^m ) = (β_n / β_m) * [SCN^-]^{n-m}.

But I think to find the fractions, we can ignore [Co] because it's a common factor.

Another approach: let's consider that the fraction of each species is proportional to β_n * [SCN^-]^n.

So, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = [β_n [SCN^-]^n ] / Σ (β_m [SCN^-]^m )

The denominator is the sum over all possible m of β_m [SCN^-]^m.

So, for each m from 0 to 4, since β0 would be 1 (since [Co] = β0 [Co][SCN^-]^0 = [Co]).

Wait, but the problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, perhaps m runs from 1 to 4, but for m=0, β0 is 1.

So f_n = [β_n * (0.1)^n ] / [ (0.1)^0 * β0 (for m=0) + (0.1)^1 β1 (m=1) + (0.1)^2 β2 (m=2) + (0.1)^3 β3 (m=3) + (0.1)^4 β4 (m=4) ) ]

Wait, but wait, β0 is 1, because [Co] is the free ion, so β0=1.

So, let's compute each term:

For m=0: term is β0 * (0.1)^0 = 1 * 1 = 1
m=1: β1 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
m=2: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4
m=3: β3 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063
m=4: β4 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Wait, but wait, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but in the problem statement, it's stated as 0.1 M, so yes, that's correct.

Now, sum all these terms:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute that.

1 + 0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 is 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 is 2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 is 2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_n for each n is (β_n * (0.1)^n ) / 2.3646.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which are the [Co(SCN)_2] complexes, which corresponds to m=2. So the fraction f_2 is (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Compute that: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, that would correspond to option D: 16.9%. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I think I might have made a mistake in the [SCN^-] value.

Wait, earlier I thought that the [SCN^-] might be 0.06 M, because 0.01 M Co can bind up to 0.04 M SCN^-, but I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Because the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, which is the total concentration, including the free and the bound. So I think using [SCN^-]=0.1 M is correct, because that's the total concentration, so when calculating the fraction, it's the free [SCN^-] that's relevant, but wait no, because the complexes are formed from the free SCN^-.

Wait, no. The [SCN^-] used in the formation constants is the free ion concentration. But in reality, when complexes form, the free [SCN^-] decreases. So if the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the complexes are formed, the free [SCN^-] is less than 0.1 M.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because I'm using 0.1 M as [SCN^-] in all the terms, but actually, the free [SCN^-] is lower, because some SCN^- is bound in the complexes.

This complicates things. So maybe I should approach this using the total [SCN^-] and set up equations accordingly.

Let me think again. The total [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M, which is the sum of the free SCN^- and the SCN^- bound in the complexes.

Let me denote s = [SCN^-]_free.

Then, total [SCN^-] = s + Σ (n * [Co(SCN)_n] ), where n is the number of SCN^- per complex.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each [Co(SCN)_n] has n SCN^- ions. So the total bound SCN^- is Σ (n * [Co(SCN)_n] ).

But the total [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is the sum of the free SCN^- and all the bound ones.

So,

s + Σ (n [Co(SCN)_n] ) = 0.1.

But [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co][s]^n, and [Co] is the free Co^2+ concentration.

But the total Co concentration is [Co] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n] = 0.01 M.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can make an approximation. Let's assume that [Co] is negligible compared to the sum of the complexes, which might not be the case, but let's try.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equations.

Let’s let [Co] = c. Then,

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * c * s^n.

And,

c + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n c s^n = 0.01.

Also, the total SCN^- is:

s + sum_{n=1 to 4} n * β_n c s^n = 0.1.

So, we have two equations:

1. c (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n s^n ) = 0.01.

2. s (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} n β_n s^{n-1} ) + sum_{n=1 to4} n β_n c s^n = 0.1.

Wait, that might be complicated, but perhaps we can make an initial assumption about s and then iterate.

But this seems like a tough system to solve without a calculator. Maybe it's beyond the scope of a multiple-choice question, so perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the change in [SCN^-] due to complex formation and use [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

If we proceed under that assumption, then the fractions are as I calculated earlier.

So, f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. But wait, that would be option D. But the options given include another option, C) 38.1%, which is about 0.381.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the denominator.

Wait, the terms are for m=0 to m=4:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1.

m=1: 9 *0.1= 0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum = 1 + 0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%, so that would be the answer.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co, so [Co(SCN)_2], which is the case we're calculating, and β2=40.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: perhaps the distribution is such that the most stable complex (highest β) dominates. Let me check the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So β3 is the highest at 63, then β2 at 40, β1 at 9, and β4 at 16.

Wait, so [Co(SCN)_3] would be the most stable. So the majority of cobalt would be in the [Co(SCN)_3] complex, followed by [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

Wait, in that case, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_3] would be higher than [Co(SCN)_2]. But in our earlier calculation, the fraction for m=2 was 16.9%, and for m=3, 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266, or 2.66%. But that can't be right, because β3 is higher. So perhaps my initial approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the m in the terms. Because the term for m=3 is β3 * (0.1)^3, which is 63 * 0.001 = 0.063. But in the denominator, the sum is 2.3646. So the fraction for m=3 is 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266, or 2.66%, and for m=2 it's 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈16.9%.

But this would imply that [Co(SCN)_3] is less than [Co(SCN)_2], which can't be right because β3 is higher than β2 (63>40). So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents. Wait, wait, the term for n=3 is [SCN^-]^3, which is (0.1)^3, but n=3 means that each complex requires 3 SCN- ions. So the term is β3 * (s)^3, where s is the free [SCN^-].

But if the [SCN^-] is 0.1, then the term for m=3 is 63*(0.1)^3=0.063, which is correct. But if β3 is higher than β2, but the term for m=3 is smaller than for m=2, because (0.1)^3 is much smaller than (0.1)^2.

Wait, but that would mean that the complex with higher β but more ligands may have a lower fraction. So perhaps the dominant term is m=2 in this case.

Wait, let's see: for m=2, the term is 0.4, which is the largest. For m=3, it's 0.063, which is smaller. So in this case, the fraction is largest for m=2, then m=1, etc.

But that would mean that the [Co(SCN)_2] is the most abundant complex, which is what we're being asked about. So the fraction would be approximately 16.9%, but that can't be right because the β3 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the fractions again.

Wait, the terms are:

m | β_m | (0.1)^m | product β_m*(0.1)^m
---|-----|---------|---------------------
0 | 1   | 1       | 1
1 |9    |0.1      |0.9
2 |40   |0.01     |0.4
3 |63   |0.001    |0.063
4 |16   |0.0001   |0.0016

So the product for m=2 is 0.4, which is the highest. So according to this, the dominant complex is m=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2], which is the one we're interested in.

But that seems counter-intuitive because β3 is higher. Wait, perhaps because m=3 requires more SCN- ions, and since SCN- is 0.1 M, the higher m reduces the product. So even though β3 is higher, the product for m=3 is lower than for m=2.

So, according to this, the fraction for m=2 is indeed the highest, followed by m=1, then m=3, etc.

Wait, but this seems a bit odd. If the β3 is the highest, shouldn't the complex with three SCN- be the most stable?

Hmm, perhaps because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is not extremely high. So when you have higher β for m=3, but higher m, the product may not be as high as for a lower m with a slightly lower β.

So back to the calculation. The fraction for m=2 is 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D. But the options include another value, 38.1% (option C). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the m=3 term is for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and m=4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4] complex has a β4 of 16, which is lower than some other terms.

Wait, but in any case, let me think differently. Perhaps I should compute the concentration of each complex, considering that the [Co] is 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, for each complex:

[Co(SCN)_1] = β1 [Co][SCN^-] = 9 * [Co] * 0.1 = 0.9 [Co]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co][SCN^-]^2 =40 * [Co] * 0.01=0.4 [Co]

[Co(SCN)_3] =63 * [Co] * (0.1)^3=63 * [Co] * 0.001=0.063 [Co]

[Co(SCN)_4] =16 * [Co] * (0.1)^4=16 * [Co] *0.0001=0.0016 [Co]

And the free [Co] is [Co].

So, the sum [Co] + 0.9[Co] +0.4[Co] +0.063[Co] +0.0016[Co] =0.01.

Adding the coefficients:

1 (for [Co]) + 0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So 2.3646 [Co] =0.01 M → [Co] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Then, the concentrations of each complex are:

[Co(SCN)_1] =0.9 * 0.004225 ≈0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] =0.4 * 0.004225 ≈0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)_3] =0.063 *0.004225≈0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)_4] =0.0016 *0.004225≈0.00000676 M.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is approximately 0.00169 M.

The total Co is 0.01 M, and the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, or 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, why was the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] the highest when β3 is higher? Because each [Co(SCN)_3] requires three SCN- ions, and with [SCN^-] at 0.1, the contribution from m=3 is smaller than m=2. So even though β3 is higher, the [Co(SCN)_3] concentration is lower.

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate ions. The stability constants provided are:

- β₁ = 9 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺),  
- β₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]),  
- β₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]),  
- β₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]).  

The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M (0.01 M), and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of its stability constant and the appropriate power of the thiocyanate concentration, normalized by the sum of all such terms.

### Step 1: Calculate the terms for each complex
For each complex, the term is given by \( \beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n \), where \( n \) is the number of thiocyanate ligands. Using \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):

- For \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).  
- For \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \).  
- For \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \).  
- For \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \).  
- For \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).  

### Step 2: Sum the terms
The total sum of all terms is:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]
The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term for } n = 2}{\text{Total Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
