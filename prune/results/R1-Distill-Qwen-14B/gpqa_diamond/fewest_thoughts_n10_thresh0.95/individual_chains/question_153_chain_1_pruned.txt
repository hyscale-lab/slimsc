Okay, I'm trying to figure out the Michael addition reactions given in the question. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question describes a Michael reaction where a nucleophile attacks the β position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The products are given, and I need to match them with the options.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt, EtOH.**

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a saponified ester, which can generate an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, wait. Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the CH2? Or wait, the structure is CH2-C(O)OEt attached to the benzene. Hmm, no, wait. The IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the gamma position. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-CH2-p-tolyl? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl. No, wait, the substituent is on the acrylate. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, but wait, the acrylate only has three carbons, right? So the substituent is on the first carbon of the acrylate. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-O- attached to p-tolyl group? No, that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl on the third carbon. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-CH2-p-tolyl. Hmm, not sure, but maybe I should proceed.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the β position of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So the attacking species is the enolate from dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so when deprotonated, it forms a strong enolate. The enolate will attack the β position of the acrylate.

The acrylate here is an α,β-unsaturated ester. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the β carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt? No, wait, the acrylate would be CH2=CHCO-OEt, but with the p-tolyl substituent? Alternatively, maybe the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate which is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl. But wait, the (E) configuration would have the substituents opposite. But I'm not entirely clear on the structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH2-(p-tolyl). So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate (CH2C(OOMe)2-) attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, it adds to it. So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the β position of the acrylate.

Wait, let me think about this. Dimethyl malonate is (CH2COOCH3)2. When deprotonated at the α-carbon, the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the β position of the acrylate, which is CH2=CHCO-OCH2-p-tolyl, the attack would occur on the CH2 part. Wait, no: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Then the β position is the CH2 next to the double bond.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the β carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CH-), adding to that carbon. The mechanism would form a new bond, and the product would have a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the product as the enolate adding to the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, which would lead to a new carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the product structure. The options for A are either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. Let's see.

Trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have the structure where the p-tolyl is attached to the middle carbon of a three-carbon chain, with carboxylate groups on both ends. So that would be OMe-COOCH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, no. Wait, the three carbons are 1, 2, 3. So 2-(p-tolyl) would have the substituent on C2. So the structure would be COOCH3-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but connected via a central carbon attached to two more carbons? No, wait, propane is three carbons. So 1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have two on C1 and one on C3.

Wait, propane has three carbons: 1, 2, 3. So 1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have two COOEt groups on C1 and one on C3. So the structure would be:

COOEt-C-(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOEt? No, wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the central carbon has the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the addition: dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2) is the nucleophile. When it adds to the acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl, the enolate would attack the β carbon (CH2 of CH2=CH-). So the addition would form a new carbon chain.

Let me draw this out mentally. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. That carbon would attack the β carbon (the CH2) of the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R is the p-tolyl group. So when the enolate attacks, the product would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the CH2 of the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps the product would be (CH2(COOCH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Wait, in the Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the β position, so the attack is at the less substituted end.

Wait, maybe the product is a new ester with the p-tolyl group attached. Let's think about the options given. Option A for reaction A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That would have three carbons: the middle one (C2) has the p-tolyl, and C1 and C3 have two COOEt groups each.

So in the product, each end (C1 and C3) would have COOEt groups, and the central carbon (C2) has the p-tolyl. That makes sense as a result of the addition of the dimethyl malonate (which has two COOEt groups on C1 and another on C3 after addition) to the acrylate.

Wait, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps that's the structure. So the product would have three COOEt groups and the p-tolyl in the middle. So option A for (A) is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that would be option A for (A).

**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH, H3O+ → B**

Hmm, the starting materials are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic. Let me think about the reaction.

1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene group attached at position 1. So the structure is a piperidine where one of the nitrogen's substituents is a cyclohexene ring attached via a single bond.

(E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN, with the (E) configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN. Wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CH-CN, but wait, butenitrile is four carbons: CH2-CH2-CH2-CN? No. Wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CH-CH2-CN? No, no. Wait, butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or CH2=CHCH2CN is propenenitrile? I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile would have the nitrile group on C4, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond? No, but that's confusing. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let's think: butenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on C1 (since nitrile is -CN). So butenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN. But but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, that can't be because the double bond is between C1 and C2, the nitrile is on C4. No, wait, but-2-ene is between C2 and C3. So but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2-CH2-CN with double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CN, but that's not possible because the nitrile is C1. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CN, but that's but-1-enenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN? No, that would be propenenitrile. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, that would be but-3-enenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction.

The other reactant is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Under acidic conditions, perhaps the cyclohexene ring will undergo some reaction. Wait, but what's the reaction between an α,β-unsaturated nitrile and another compound. Maybe a conjugate addition (Michael addition) here?

So (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The other compound is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Under acidic conditions (MeOH, H3O+), perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene ring becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic. Alternatively, the cyclohexene could act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but that requires a diene.

Alternatively, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor because it's an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl analog (but it's a nitrile here). The nucleophile would attack the β position.

Wait, but piperidine is a nucleophile. In acidic conditions, perhaps it gets protonated. Wait, but the compound is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which has a ring with a double bond. Maybe the double bond could undergo some addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is part of a conjugated system that can undergo a conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene is part of an enamine. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is like a piperidine ring attached to a cyclohexene at position 1 (the same carbon where the double bond is). So the structure is a piperidine with a cyclohexene substituent.

In the presence of acid, the cyclohexene could become more electrophilic. Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine acts as the nucleophile. Wait, but piperidine is a secondary amine, which is a nucleophile. So in the presence of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, the secondary amine (from the piperidine) could attack the β position.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, the piperidine might get protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring in the piperidine could act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the (E)-but-2-enenitrile as the dienophile.

Wait, but Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The cyclohexene is a diene? No, it's a monoene. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is part of a conjugated system that can undergo a Michael addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the nucleophile is the piperidine's enamine or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition where the piperidine's enolate attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. But wait, piperidine is a secondary amine and may not form an enolate easily. Alternatively, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and another nucleophile attacks it.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is part of the structure that can undergo a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the nucleophile is a group from the piperidine.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and the nucleophile is a hydroxide or something else. But the conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which is acidic, so perhaps it's a Michael addition under acidic conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the (E)-but-2-enenitrile can undergo a conjugate addition. The piperidine's ring could have a hydrogen that's acidic, allowing the formation of an enamine or enol, which can attack the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring in the piperidine could act as a diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrocyanation or something else, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the electrophilic partner, and the piperidine's ring has a nucleophilic site.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine acts as a base, deprotonating something. But under acidic conditions, that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine's hydrogen alpha to the ring is abstracted to form an enamine, which then attacks the β position.

Wait, the product option for B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That structure implies a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 2, connected to a butane chain ending in a nitrile.

Wait, let me think. If the piperidine's cyclohexene ring undergoes some reaction, perhaps a ring-opening or addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the electrophile, and the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is part of a conjugated system that can attack it.

Hmm, perhaps the piperidine is not directly reacting but is part of the nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene is being used as a diene, but without a dienophile, that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: looking at the product options. For reaction B, the options are 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

The product B is either a nitrile attached to a butane chain, which is connected to a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (oxo) group at position 2, or a hydroxyl group on a cyclohexene ring.

Given the starting materials, perhaps the piperidine's ring is opening or undergoing some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is undergoing a Michael addition. Wait, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine's amine is the nucleophile. But in acidic conditions, the amine would be protonated and not nucleophilic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's ring is acting as a nucleophile. Wait, but piperidine is a secondary amine, which under acidic conditions might not be the best nucleophile.

Wait, maybe the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as an electrophile, and the piperidine's ring is providing a nucleophilic site.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroxylation or some other addition.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is adding across the cyclohexene ring in a [4+2] cycloaddition, but that's a Diels-Alder reaction. However, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The cyclohexene ring is a diene, and the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the dienophile (as it's an α,β-unsaturated nitrile). So under heat or other conditions, a Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring.

But the conditions here are MeOH and H3O+ (acid), which might favor a different reaction.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexene) and dienophile (but-2-enenitrile) would form a six-membered ring with two substituents. But the product options don't show a six-membered ring. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition. The (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and the nucleophile is from the piperidine.

Wait, another thought: maybe the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is not directly involved, and the reaction is between the (E)-but-2-enenitrile and some other nucleophile present.

Wait, the conditions are MeOH and H3O+. Perhaps this is a hydrolysis condition for the nitrile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile under acidic conditions might hydrolyze to a ketone or amide, but I'm not sure. But the product options for B have nitrile groups, so perhaps hydrolysis isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing a conjugate addition with another nucleophile. Let's think about the structure. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or CH2=CHCN? No, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2-CN but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN? But that doesn't make sense because the nitrile is at the end. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. No, that's not possible because butenitrile is four carbons, so but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN, which would have the nitrile on the fourth carbon. That's unlikely because that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the product options for B. Option A: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would be a four-carbon chain (butane) attached to a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2. The nitrile is at the end of the butane.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-C≡N connected to a cyclohexane ring where the second carbon is a ketone (O).

So how would this form? Perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is adding to the cyclohexene ring to form a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the electrophilic partner, and the nucleophile comes from the piperidine.

Wait, another approach: the piperidine has a cyclohexene ring attached. Could the cyclohexene ring undergo a conjugate addition with the (E)-but-2-enenitrile?

Wait, but the cyclohexene is a diene, not an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and the cyclohexene ring is providing a nucleophilic site.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's ring is opening in some way, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is adding to the piperidine's ring via a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another thought: maybe the piperidine under acidic conditions forms an enamine or some conjugated system that can attack the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the nucleophile is a hydrogen from the piperidine. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's ring is acting as a base, deprotonating something else in the solution.

Wait, maybe the reaction involves the piperidine's ring opening and adding to the nitrile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but
