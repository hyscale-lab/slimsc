Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, right... parallax is related to distance somehow.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think I need to relate the number of stars to the distance. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but that can't be right because as distance increases, the number of stars I can observe should decrease, right? Because stars are more spread out. Oh wait, wait. Wait a second. Maybe I'm getting the proportionality wrong.

Let me think again. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1 / plx^5 ), where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5.

Wait, that would mean that as r increases (distance increases), the number of stars N increases as r^5. But that doesn't make sense intuitively. Because if I look further away, I should see fewer stars in a given region, not more. Unless the region is getting bigger. Oh wait, wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a region is related to the volume of that region. Volume depends on distance. But how does the parallax come into play here?

Wait, maybe the region in question is a volume element, and the number of stars in it depends on the distance. So perhaps they're looking at how the number of stars in a shell of radius r to r+dr varies with r.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a certain area (like a square degree) changes with distance.

Wait, I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then find how the number of stars varies with r.

So parallax plx is 1/r, in parsecs. So if N ∝ 1/(plx^5), substituting plx=1/r gives N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars would increase with r^5. But that seems counterintuitive because, as we go further away, the density of stars in a given volume should decrease, making the number of stars observed in that volume decrease. Oh wait, but the volume itself increases with r^3. So perhaps the number of stars depends on both the volume and some other factor.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the number of stars is varying with the area or something else. Let me think about the concept. The number of stars in a given direction (like on the celestial sphere) at a certain distance r depends on the density of stars and the volume we're considering.

If the density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume would go as r^3. But the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a given area (like a square degree) as a function of distance. Because as you go further, each square degree covers a larger volume. So the number of stars per square degree would be proportional to the density times the volume per square degree.

The volume per square degree (like a cone) is approximately (4/3)π r^2 * dr, but wait, for a given solid angle, the volume element is (r^2 dr) * solid angle (if solid angle is in steradians). So for a given solid angle, the volume is proportional to r^2 dr.

If the number of stars is N = density * volume, and if the density is uniform, then N ∝ r^2 dr, which would mean that the number of stars per unit distance (dr) increases as r^2. But that's not matching the options given.

Wait, the question states that N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So let's express this in terms of r.

N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But that would suggest that as r increases, the number of stars increases. That's the opposite of what I might expect if it's a uniform distribution, because at larger r, the volume is larger, but the number of stars per unit volume is the same. So the number of stars would increase as r^3. But the question says it's r^5. So perhaps the density of stars isn't uniform, but decreases with distance.

Wait, maybe the space density of stars (stars per unit volume) is changing. If the density of stars decreases with distance, then the number of stars in a volume would depend on both the volume (r^3) and the density.

Suppose the space density of stars, n, is proportional to 1/r^k. Then the total number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be N = n * (4π r^2 dr). So N = (C / r^k) * 4 π r^2 dr = C' r^{2 -k} dr.

If the given relation is N ∝ r^5, then 2 -k =5 → k= -3. That would mean the space density of stars is increasing with r^3. That's a bit odd because stars are more concentrated at larger distances, which isn't typical. But the question is about a specific region where perhaps more stars are present at larger distances, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the given relation is that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ plx^{-5} = (1/r)^{-5} = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But how does that make sense? If N is the number of stars per unit volume, then that can't be right. Wait, maybe N is the number of stars in a unit area (like per square parsec) as you go to a distance r. Because as you go further, each square parsec corresponds to a larger volume. So for a given area, the number of stars would be density multiplied by volume per area.

Wait, let's model it. Imagine looking at a thin shell of thickness dr at distance r. The volume of that shell is approximately 4π r^2 dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be N = n * 4 π r^2 dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5, then:

r^5 ∝ N = n * r^2 dr → n ∝ r^3 / dr.

But dr is a differential; perhaps the question is considering the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a certain direction (like a line of sight) up to distance r is the integral of the space density along that line. So N = ∫ n(r') dr' from 0 to r. If n(r) is proportional to r^m, then N ∝ r^{m+1}.

But the question states that N varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So N = ∫n(r') dr' → if N ∝ r^5, then n(r) must be such that the integral gives r^5. Let's see: if n(r) = kr^4, then integrating from 0 to r gives (k/5) r^5, which is proportional to r^5. So n(r) ∝ r^4.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a region is inversely proportional to the parallax to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5.

So how does N change with distance? As r increases, N increases as r^5, which is a very rapid increase.

But the question is asking, per unit range of distance (r). So perhaps the number of stars per unit distance (like dr) is what's being considered. Wait, that's another approach. If N is the number of stars in a range dr, then dN/dr = N per unit r. So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as an option. Wait, the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~r^2.

So if N ∝ r^5, then the number per unit distance is r^4, which is option C. But the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So if N is the total number in a region, and that's proportional to r^5, then the density (number per unit distance) would be dN/dr = 5 r^4.

But the question says that the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So I think the answer is r^5, which is option B.

Wait, but that contradicts the intuition. Because if you look further away, you can see more stars only if their density increases with distance. Otherwise, if the density is constant, the number of stars in a volume would increase as r^3, but the question says it's increasing as r^5. So the density must be increasing with r^2, because (r^3) * (r^2) = r^5.

But how does that relate to the options?

Wait, the options are about the number of stars in the region as a function of distance per unit range. So if N ∝ r^5, then for each additional distance unit (dr), the number increases by r^5 * dr. So the change per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5 r^4.

But the question asks, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", which I think refers to the derivative, the rate of change. So dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k (plx)^(-5) = k r^5. So N is the total number, and how does it change as a function of r? N increases with r^5. So the change is proportional to r^5, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking, how does the number of stars in a unit volume change with distance. But I think the way the question is phrased, it's about N as a function of r. So if N = r^5, then the change in N with r is r^5, which is option B.

But wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So maybe they're asking for the change in N per unit distance. So in that case, it's dN/dr = 5 r^4. But that would be option C.

Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me reread the question.

"In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Oh, so the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is, how does the number of stars in that region change with distance (per unit range). So per unit distance, how much does N increase?

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then per unit distance, the change would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be r^4. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, perhaps the question is implying that the number of stars in the region scales as r^5, so the change with distance is r^5. So the correct answer is B.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about what the question is really asking. It says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So for a given parallax, the number of stars is 1/(plx^5). Parallax is 1/r, so substituting, N = (r)^5.

So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region increases with r^5. So the answer is option B.

But wait, the part about per unit range of distance, that's about the slope, right? So if N(r) = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5 k r^4, so the change in N per unit r is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

But the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's N that is proportional to r^5, so the change is B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think of an example. Suppose at r=1, N=1^5=1. At r=2, N=32. So the number increases by 31 units when r increases by 1. So the change per unit r is approximately 31, which is 32-1. So the change is about 32 when r=2. So the change is N(r) - N(r-1) ≈ 5 r^4, because derivative is 5 r^4, and the change is approximately derivative times dr (dr=1). So the change per unit distance is about 5 r^4.

So the change in N per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer is C.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So I think that's asking about dN/dr, which is r^4. So the answer is C.

But I'm a bit torn because the given relation is N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But the question is about the rate of change, which is r^4.

Hmm, perhaps the options are a bit ambiguous, but based on the phrasing, I think it's asking for the rate of change. So the answer is C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question further asks how the number of stars changes "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Given the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the change is not proportional to \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \) is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the change is not proportional to \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
