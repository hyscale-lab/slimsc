Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And they're asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are four points in 3D space, labeled A to D.

Hmm. I remember that density matrices represent quantum states, especially mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when you have a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of different projectors. The given ρ looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Wait, let's think about the structure of a qubit state. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

So, the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. The Bloch vector r has components (r_x, r_y, r_z), and the length of r determines how mixed the state is. If r is zero, then ρ is the maximally mixed state, I/2, which is what they're giving here.

Wait wait, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with [1,0;0,0], and |1⟩⟨1| is [0,0;0,1]. Adding them gives [1,0;0,1], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5], which is the same as I/2.

Oh right, because I (identity matrix) is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is exactly what ρ is. So in Bloch sphere terms, when the density matrix is I/2, the Bloch vector r must be zero. Because the general form is (I + r·σ)/2, so if r is zero, you get I/2.

So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is point (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Alternatively, if I remember correctly, the Bloch vector for a completely mixed state (maximally mixed) is at the center of the sphere, which is (0,0,0). So this must be the case here.

Let me double-check. Other options: A is (1,1,0), which would imply a state along the x-y plane, but with r length sqrt(2). But our state is the completely mixed state, so r is zero. Option B is (0,0,1) which points along the z-axis, but that would correspond to a state like (I + σz)/2, which would be a state like cos^2(θ)|0⟩ + sin^2(θ)|1⟩, but for θ=45 degrees, it would be a completely mixed state? Wait no, no—because in that case, the density matrix would be diagonal with [ (1 +1)/2, ... ] which is [1,0;0,1]/2, which is the same as our case. Wait, no, because (I + σz)/2 would be [ (1+1)/2 , 0; 0, (1-1)/2 ]? Wait no, σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So (I + σz)/2 is (1/2)[ [2, 0], [0, 0] ] which is [1,0; 0,0], which is |0⟩⟨0|. So that's a pure state, not mixed.

Wait, but in our case, the density matrix is I/2. So the Bloch vector must be zero. So the correct position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is zero because there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the state being located at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by the coordinates \((0, 0, 0)\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\((1, 1, 0)\)): This corresponds to a state with a Bloch vector in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, which is not the case here.
- **Option B** (\((0, 0, 1)\)): This corresponds to a state along the \(z\)-axis, which would represent a mixed state with some preference for \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\), but not the completely mixed state.
- **Option C** (\((0, 0, 0)\)): This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which matches the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D** (\((1, 1, 1)\)): This corresponds to a state with a Bloch vector in all three dimensions, which is not applicable here.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
