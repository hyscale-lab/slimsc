Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me. It's about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry means the molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a plane of symmetry that passes through the axis. So, the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and has a mirror plane along that axis.

The question lists four molecules, and I need to figure out which one has this symmetry. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, the options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I remember that triisopropyl borate is a compound with three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. Let me visualize it. Boron typically has a trigonal planar structure. If each isopropyl group is in a plane, then the molecule should have a trigonal planar symmetry. Wait, but C3h is a higher symmetry than just trigonal. So, maybe if all the isopropyl groups are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule could have C3h. But I'm not too sure about that. Another thought: triisopropyl borate is known to have a trigonal planar structure, which is C3v? Or maybe Cs? Wait, no, I think because the three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, it's C3h. Hmm, but wait—wait, I might be mixing up the point groups. Let me think: C3h would mean a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is symmetrical across that plane and can be rotated 120 degrees to look the same, then yes. Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups, so maybe it's C3h. But I'm not certain. I've heard that triisopropyl borate has a C3h symmetry because of the trigonal arrangement and the mirror plane. I'll tentatively think option C might be correct, but I should check the others.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane ring. Wait, the structure has three bridges. So it's a non-planar molecule with a threefold axis. Let me visualize it. The molecule is symmetric, with each bridge being the same. When rotated 120 degrees, it looks the same, right? Oh, wait, but does it have a mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry because of the rotation, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's D3h. Wait, no, because it's not a planar molecule. So, perhaps it has C3 symmetry without the mirror plane. So, maybe it's C3 but not C3h. That might mean option D isn't correct.

Now option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm. Benzo-fused with a trifuran system. Wait, the structure would have a central trifuran ring with benzene rings attached. Let me imagine it. The molecule has three substituents from the benzene rings attached to the central furan rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic system. Benzo is usually a benzene ring fused to other rings. The way it's written, [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''] suggests that the benzene is fused in a particular way. Wait, perhaps each benzene is attached at each c position. So, three benzene rings attached to the central furan system. If each benzene is attached at each of the three possible positions, the molecule would have a threefold axis. But for C3h, it needs a horizontal mirror plane. If all the substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, then perhaps it does have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is flat, so a mirror plane is present. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion, making it have higher symmetry.

Wait, thinking again about the nomenclature: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So the benzene rings are attached to the trifuran in positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6. So each benzene is connected to the central furan ring. So each benzene is at a different position. If they're all attached symmetrically, maybe the molecule has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe they are arranged at 120 degrees apart, so rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetrical across a plane that includes the rotation axis, then yes. So perhaps option B is C3h.

Wait, but the substituents on the furan rings could be in positions that allow for a mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical enough. I'm not entirely sure about this one.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The way it's fused, each phenyl is attached at the c positions. So positions 1,2; 5,6; and 9,10. Each of these benzene rings is attached to the central furan system. So again, three substituents attached symmetrically. So if each benzene is at 120-degree positions, perhaps the molecule has a threefold rotation axis. Additionally, if there's a mirror plane through the rotation axis, then it's C3h.

Wait, but triphenyl groups... Wait, but triphenylene would have three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric fashion, perhaps leading to C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's triphenylene substituted in a way that's symmetric. Hmm.

So now I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each structure.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups attached to B. The molecule is trigonal planar, so it should have a threefold rotation axis. It's a flat molecule, so any plane through the B atom and perpendicular to the plane would be a mirror plane. Wait, but C3h requires a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, the C3h point group is a threefold rotation combined with a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the point group definitions. C3h is a point group with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes the axis. So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have a mirror plane along the axis.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. So it's in the same plane. Each isopropyl group is attached to boron in a 120-degree arrangement. So the molecule has a threefold axis (C3) and a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (since it's flat). So wait, that would be a vertical mirror plane, not a horizontal one. Because the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis (which is in the plane of the molecule). So perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, which would make the point group C3v, not C3h.

Wait, but C3h requires a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe triisopropyl borate isn't C3h, but rather C3v. Because the mirror plane is vertical.

Then, which of the options have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. The C3h group has a threefold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Wait, no, a horizontal mirror plane would be parallel to the plane where the rotation occurs. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the chair conformations or other molecules.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of a molecule that's flat and has a plane of symmetry cutting through the center. So, a flat molecule with a central atom and substituents arranged symmetrically around it would have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, maybe the molecule with a plane of symmetry that includes the rotation axis would have C3h. For example, if the rotation axis is vertical, and the mirror plane is horizontal, passing through the axis.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, so the rotation axis is in the plane. The mirror plane would be vertical, so that's C3v, not C3h.

Then, which of the other options have a horizontal mirror plane along the threefold axis?

Looking at the other molecules, benzo and triphenyleno derivatives. Maybe those are flat, with substituents arranged around a central ring.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, let's think about their structures again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So the benzene rings are fused to the central furan. So the arrangement is similar to a benzene ring fused to each of the three positions of the trifuran. So each benzene is attached at a different position. If the arrangement is such that each benzene is at 120 degrees apart, then the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis. Additionally, if there's a mirror plane bisecting the molecule along the rotation axis, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar, allowing for a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows that symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. Again, if they're equally spaced, then C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of substituents. Triphenyleno would have three phenyl groups, so that could provide the necessary symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I remember that triphenylene has a structure where three benzene rings are fused in a symmetric way, leading to a high symmetry. Wait, no, triphenylene is a [6]circulene, which has three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way, but its symmetry is higher than C3h. Wait, but the molecule in option A is triphenyleno fused with a trifuran ring. So perhaps that introduces asymmetry, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Wait, but earlier I thought it's C3v, not C3h.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual molecular structures. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. The point group would be D3h if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, wait, no, D3h is different. Let me think again.

The point group C3h consists of a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for example, a molecule that's flat (like benzene) but arranged in a symmetric trigonal pattern with a mirror plane through the center and perpendicular to the plane would have C3h. Wait, no. Wait, the mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, which would be in the same plane as the rotation axis.

Wait, perhaps a flat molecule with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane would be C3h. So, for instance, if you have a molecule where the rotation axis is vertical, and the mirror plane is horizontal across the middle, then it's C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is flat, but the mirror plane would be vertical, not horizontal. So it's C3v.

Which brings me back to the other options. So, perhaps the correct answer is D) quinuclidine? Wait, but earlier I thought quinuclidine might be C3 but not C3h because it's not flat. But I'm not sure.

Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure is symmetrical with three bridges. So, does it have a threefold axis? Yes, because each bridge is identical, so rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. And, does it have a mirror plane that includes the rotation axis? If the molecule is symmetrical across such a plane, then yes.

Wait, but because the molecule is non-planar, the mirror plane would have to pass through the center and perhaps through some of the bridges. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a center of inversion, making it have a higher symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3i (threefold inversion) axis, but that's different from C3h.

Wait, I think quinuclidine has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. Because when you look at the structure, you can imagine a plane cutting through the center of the molecule, perhaps through one of the bridges and the opposite part, acting as a mirror plane. So, yes, maybe quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3v, but I don't think so.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C might be C3h, but maybe it's C3v. So, if the correct answer is A, B, C, or D, which one has C3h.

Another approach: perhaps look for molecules with threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, flat molecules with three substituents arranged symmetrically.

Triisopropyl borate: flat, three identical substituents. But the mirror plane is vertical, so point group C3v. So not C3h.

So, which of the other options are flat with three substituents?

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. So it's a tricyclic system, perhaps flat. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric trigonal pattern, then perhaps C3h.

Wait, the trifuran would have three benzene rings attached. Are the substituents at each position arranged symmetrically? If the three benzene rings are at 120-degree positions around the central furan ring, then the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis. And if there's a mirror plane through the center and perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, so the mirror plane is horizontal, which would be in the plane of the molecule. Wait, no—horizontal would be parallel to the plane. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Wait, another approach: the point group C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So any molecule with C3h must have a horizontal mirror plane and a threefold axis.

If a molecule is flat (like benzene) and has a horizontal mirror plane, then with a threefold axis, it would be C3h.

Wait, but the molecules in the options are more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) is arranged in a symmetric way with three substituents, leading to C3h.

Wait, perhaps the benzo-fused rings are arranged symmetrically. So, the central furan would have three benzene rings attached at each of the three positions, leading to a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: perhaps look for which of the options are known to have C3h symmetry.

I recall that triisopropyl borane (without the 'ate' suffix) has C3v symmetry because it's trigonal planar with a vertical mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate has the same structure—so perhaps it's also C3v.

Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a threefold axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, so it's C3h. So, that would make option D correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about that. Let me think again.

Quinuclidine: the structure has three bridges. When you look along the threefold axis, each bridge is identical. So, rotating 120 degrees would look the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If you imagine a plane cutting through the center of the molecule, perhaps through one bridge and the opposite side, then yes. So, the mirror plane would reflect one bridge to another, maintaining the structure. Thus, it would have C3h symmetry.

So, putting this all together, the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze each option based on the definition of **C₃h** symmetry: a threefold rotation axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane that includes the rotation axis. This symmetry implies that the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and has a plane of symmetry passing through the axis.

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached at symmetric positions. The phenyl groups are arranged at 120-degree intervals, suggesting a threefold rotation axis. However, the molecule is not flat, and there is no clear horizontal mirror plane that includes the rotation axis. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule has a trifuran core with three benzene rings fused at symmetric positions. The arrangement suggests a threefold rotation axis due to the symmetric placement of the benzene rings. However, the molecule is not flat, and there is no clear horizontal mirror plane that includes the rotation axis. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. It has a threefold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a vertical mirror plane, but no horizontal mirror plane. This makes it **C₃v**, not **C₃h**. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with three identical bridges. It has a threefold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane that includes the rotation axis. This combination satisfies the definition of **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, quinuclidine exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the molecule with **C₃h** symmetry is **quinuclidine**.

Answer: D
