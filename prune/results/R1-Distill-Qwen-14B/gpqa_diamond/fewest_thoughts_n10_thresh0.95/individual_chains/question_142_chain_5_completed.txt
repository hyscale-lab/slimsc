Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, not just a pure state. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think I need to figure out where this state is located geometrically in the qubits space.

Wait, qubits live in a two-dimensional space, right? So the state can be represented as a point in that space. But wait, the options given are three-dimensional points. Oh, maybe because when considering the Bloch sphere, which is a 2D space embedded in 3D. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states.

So, I remember that any single qubit state can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>. The corresponding Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ).

But wait, this is for a pure state. The given ρ is a density matrix. So I need to think about mixed states. Oh right, for a mixed state, the density matrix can sometimes represent a statistical mixture of pure states. So what does ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 represent?

Each term |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors onto the |0> and |1> states, respectively. So ρ is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability 1/2.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the pure states |0> and |1> correspond to the points at the poles. |0> is at (0,0,1), and |1> is at (0,0,-1). But wait, the density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So it's an equal mixture of these two states.

I'm trying to recall how mixed states are represented on the Bloch sphere. Oh right, a mixed state can be thought of as a statistical ensemble of pure states. So for this case, ρ is a completely mixed state in the computational basis.

Wait, but when a state is completely mixed, it's as far from any pure state as possible. In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the sphere. Because the center has all components zero. Wait, the center is (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere coordinates.

Wait, but let me think again. The maximally mixed state in 2x2 dimensions is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Oh wait, let me compute ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Since |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

So ρ is indeed the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. The center in Bloch sphere coordinates is (0,0,0). So the corresponding point r is (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically an equal probability mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) correspond to the north and south poles, respectively, at coordinates \((0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,-1)\). However, the given density matrix is a maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is because the maximally mixed state is represented by the identity matrix scaled by \(1/2\), which geometrically corresponds to the origin \((0,0,0)\) in the Bloch sphere coordinates.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r=(1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**B) \(r=(0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this is the position of the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the mixed state.  
**C) \(r=(0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r=(1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid position in the Bloch sphere coordinates.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
