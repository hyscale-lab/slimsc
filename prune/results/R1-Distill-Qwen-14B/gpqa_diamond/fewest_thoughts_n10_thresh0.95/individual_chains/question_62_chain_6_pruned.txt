--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different set of reagents. Hmm.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The name is a bit complex, so breaking it down: the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, at the 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that would be a substituent where a methyl group is attached to both a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which I think is a cyclohexane ring connected to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another cyclohexane (the main ring). Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group? Hmm, maybe I should draw this out.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to figure out the steps to get from this starting material to the target. Let's think about possible reactions. Ethynyl groups can be functionalized in various ways. Common reactions include hydroboration, hydration, or reactions to form rings.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. How do we get an aldehyde from an alkyne? One way is to perform a hydroboration followed by oxidation. Or perhaps some kind of oxidation of a terminal alkyne. Alternatively, the alkyne could be converted into a ketone or aldehyde.

But wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is first converted into a diol, and then somehow oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a cyclohexene ring via some cycloaddition or ring-closing reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, looking at the target molecule, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another cyclohexane that has an aldehyde. So maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is used to form a ring. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. If the alkyne undergoes some kind of cyclopropane formation, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a ring via a conjugate addition or another method. Wait, maybe it's a Grignard reaction? No, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone. How? If we have ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can protonate the alkyne and then perform an oxidation. Wait, or maybe, I could use a dihydroxylation of the alkyne. Let me think: triple bonds can be hydroxylated to form vicinal diols, but that's usually with ozone or other reagents, but that's for dihydroxylation. Wait, no, that's for alkenes. Oh, wait, for alkynes, the dihydroxylation isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, maybe we can add a water across the triple bond.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some method. Oh, wait! There's the method where an alkyne can be treated with a strong base like NaNH2 and then alkylated. Wait, no, that's more for deprotonating compounds. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted to an aldehyde. How? One way is through the hydroalumination reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a strong base to form a diradical or something, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to use a strong base like NaNH2. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonating compounds, especially in alkyne chemistry. So if we have ethynylcyclohexane, and we treat it with NaNH2, and maybe an alkyl halide, like methyl chloride or ethyl chloride. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh, wait, that's the method for the alkyne alkylation. So, for example, in the presence of a strong base, NaNH2, the alkyne can be deprotonated to form an acetylide ion. Then, an alkyl halide can be used to alkylate the acetylide. So, for example, if we use ethyl chloride, we can get an ethyl group added to the alkyne.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So if we deprotonate the alkyne (which would be the terminal proton, since the alkyne is R-C≡CH), the NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form R-C≡C⁻. Then, adding an alkyl chloride, like methyl chloride, would give R-C≡C-Me.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another cyclohexane. Hmm. Maybe the alkyne is being converted into a diol first, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to alkylate the alkyne. Let's say we add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes methylcyclohexenylcyclohexane? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated. So if we have an internal alkyne, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the triple bond to form a single bond. Wait, but in our case, after alkylation, it's R-C≡C-Me. If we hydrogenate that, perhaps with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it would become R-CH2-CH2-Me. So that gives a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone. For that, I think maybe oxidation of an alkyne can give a ketone. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps using O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe we should look at the reagents in the options and see what each step does.

Looking at option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, step 3 is written twice, probably a typo. So steps are: NaNH2 and MeCl, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, NaNH2 and MeCl would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then add methyl chloride. So, R-C≡C-Me.

Then H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or for epoxidation? Wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction or in some elimination reactions. Alternatively, perhaps for epoxide opening but I'm not sure.

Then H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O. H2SO4 and HgSO4 sound like conditions for acid-catalyzed hydration or maybe for forming sulfonates. Wait, HgSO4 is used in the oxymercuration reaction, which is for adding water across double bonds, but if the previous step didn't involve a double bond, this might not make sense.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

So, steps: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne and add ethyl group, giving R-C≡C-Et. Then, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, if we have an alkyne with an ethyl group, what would happen? Wait, Li in liquid ammonia is used for deprotonation or for elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's for forming a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure. Then, O3/H2O would ozonolyze any double bonds, but if the previous step didn't form a double bond, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 step is for forming a triple bond into a diene or something else. Maybe the NaNH2 and ethyl chloride give a longer alkyne, then Li/NH3 leads to some alkylation or elimination, perhaps forming a ring.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 1: deprotonate and methylate, giving R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3. That's a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if the previous step has a single bond (from triple to single), maybe the molecule has a double bond now? Wait, no, because hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) to a single bond would give a single bond. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation didn't fully reduce the triple bond, leaving a double bond, but that's not how H2/Pd works. Pd typically reduces triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, unless in the second step, the alkyne is somehow being hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Oh wait, some catalysts can give partial hydrogenation. Like, using a Lindlar catalyst (Pd with quinoline) would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond. But in this case, the catalyst is Pd on calcium carbonate, which is probably for full hydrogenation. So step 2 would have a single bond, so step 3, O3, which needs a double bond, wouldn't do much. So that's confusing.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So step 1: NaNH2 with methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol can act as an electrophile. So in this case, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated to form the acetylide, which would then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, unless it's in a specific condition. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the alkyne, and then the methanol acts as a methylating agent. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 is for something else.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again about the target structure. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent, which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So maybe the substituent comes from a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane can be used to form a ring through cyclopropane formation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized to a ketone or something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexene via hydrogenation. Then, a dihydroxylation could add two hydroxyl groups across the double bond, creating a diol. Then, that diol could undergo some elimination or oxidation.

But looking at the target, the substituent is a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexylmethyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then one of the hydroxyl groups is oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrolyzed to form a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option step by step.

Let's take option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes methylcyclohexenylcyclohexane? No, wait, the product would be methyl substituted on the alkyne. So, R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond, so R-CH2-CH2-Me.

But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a C≡CH group). After adding methyl, it's R-C≡C-Me. Hydrogenation would make R-CH2-CH2-Me. So the molecule would have a two-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is for breaking double bonds. But if step 2 reduces the triple bond to single, there are no double bonds. So that doesn't make sense. Unless perhaps the hydrogenation didn't go all the way, but I don't think so with Pd-CaCO3.

So maybe option C is not correct.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then react with methanol. But I'm not sure if MeOH would methylate the acetylide. Maybe it's a substitution reaction, but I think usually for such alkylation, you need a good leaving group. So maybe this step isn't alkylation but something else. Or perhaps it's quenching the acetylide with methanol, leading to a ketone? Wait, no, quenching with an alcohol usually gives the corresponding alkane. For example, R-C≡C-Me would come from MeCl, but with MeOH, perhaps R-C≡C-OH, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from an oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So, the process might involve forming a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, how do we get an aldehyde? Typically, oxidation of a primary alcohol gives a ketone, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone. Primary alcohol gives aldehyde or carboxylic acid, depending on conditions. Wait, but in any case, perhaps the target has a secondary alcohol that is then oxidized. But the target has an aldehyde, so maybe the aldehyde is directly formed.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde. How? One method is the hydroboration-oxidation of an alkyne. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then oxidized further.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again, focusing on the steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So deprotonate alkyne, add ethyl group. R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent. In this context, maybe it's for deprotonation, but more likely for elimination. For example, if we have a vicinal dihalide, Li in NH3 could induce elimination, forming a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne after ethylation is then deprotonated further or undergoes some reaction to form a ring.

3. O3/H2O. Ozonolysis of a double bond. So if step 2 formed a double bond, step 3 would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH. Maybe work-up or to add hydroxyl groups.

Hmm. Let's think: ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethylated to R-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3. Perhaps this induces a ring-closing reaction. Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is often used for alkyne reductions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the alkyne is converted into a diradical or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexenyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then some dihydroxylation occurs, followed by oxidation to form a ketone or aldehyde.

But in the target, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, so perhaps the aldehyde is formed from the cyclohexane's substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has two cyclohexane rings. The main ring has the aldehyde group, and the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the alkyne is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is used to create a bridged bicyclic compound. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a single bond, and then a ring is formed between the two cyclohexane rings.

How would that happen? Maybe via a conjugate addition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then the diol is oxidized into a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about each step for option C again. Maybe I missed something.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3. So R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Wait, but if the molecule now has R-CH2-CH2-Me, which is a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So that can't be right.

So maybe option C is incorrect.

Option B: Let's go through it again.

Step 1: R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Could this be a deprotonation to form a strong base, leading to elimination? Or perhaps it's a method to form a trans-alkene. Wait, Li in NH3 is used in the Birch reduction, which is for aromatic rings, but maybe in this case, it's for forming a triple bond into a diradical, but not sure.

Another thought: If R-C≡C-Et is treated with Li in NH3, maybe it forms a ring. For example, if the ethyl group is added to the alkyne, and then a ring is formed via elimination. Wait, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the terminal end, making R-C≡C-Et. Then, with a strong base like Li, perhaps it eliminates to form a ring. For example, if the ethyl group is adjacent to the cyclohexane, elimination could form a cyclopropane or a bridge.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the alkyne, giving R-C≡C-Et. Then, the Li in NH3 could induce elimination, removing a proton and the ethyl group, forming a double bond between the cyclohexane and the adjacent carbon. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition, but I'm not certain.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. If after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. So, if step 2 forms a cyclohexene ring, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, creating two carbonyl groups.

But in the target molecule, the substituent is a single hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So maybe ozonolysis is followed by a reductive work-up to prevent over-oxidation. For example, using (CH3)2S as a reductant would give aldehydes instead of carboxylic acids.

Then, step 4: NH4OH. Maybe it's a basic work-up or for forming an amine, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, trying to put it together. Let's outline the steps for option B:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms ethyl-substituted alkyne R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps induces elimination to form a double bond, making R-CH2-CH2-Et, but that's after hydrogenation? Or perhaps forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps after ethylation, R-C≡C-Et, and then Li in NH3 induces a [2+2] cycloaddition or some ring formation. Alternatively, maybe the Li is used for deprotonation, leading to a carbanion which could attack another part of the molecule, forming a ring.

Assuming that, after ethylation and ring formation, there's a double bond formed. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into carbonyls. If the ring is broken, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is for a conjugate addition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is added, then the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cis or trans double bond. Wait, but in option B, step 2 is Li in NH3, which I think is more about elimination.

Wait, maybe the Li in NH3 is for forming a Grignard reagent, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the target molecule again. The main ring has an aldehyde group, and the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- group.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then oxidizing one of the diol's hydroxyl groups to a ketone, which is then further modified.

Wait, another approach: the alkyne is first converted into a cyclohexene via hydrogenation. Then, dihydroxylation (like with O3 and H2O) forms a diol. Then, oxidation of one diol OH group forms a ketone, but how would that lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then treated with Ba(OH)2 to form a geminal diol, which can then be oxidized to a carbonyl group. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can induce elimination, perhaps leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at option A:

Steps: NaNH2 and MeCl, then H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

After step 1: R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination? For example, Ba(OH)2 can cause elimination reactions. So, perhaps R-CH2-CH2-Me with Ba(OH)2 would eliminate to form a double bond, R-CH2-CH2-Me → R-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would require adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for something else.

Then, step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That looks like the conditions for oxymercuration, which adds water across a triple bond, but if the triple bond has been hydrogenated already, this wouldn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps it's for acid-catalyzed hydration of a double bond. If after step 3, we have a double bond, then step 4 would add water to form an alcohol.

But the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps after adding an alcohol, oxidation would form the aldehyde.

Wait, let me try to outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2, add methyl → R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → Perhaps this is for elimination, forming a double bond. So R-CH2-CH2-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me (no change?), maybe not. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone. For example, converting R-C≡CH into R-CO-R'. How? Maybe via the Stephen reduction, which reduces an alkyne to a ketone. But I think that requires a catalyst with CO.

Wait, but in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Could that form a ketone? Deprotonating the alkyne, then reacting with methanol—maybe it's a substitution, but that would give R-C≡C-OH, which might not help. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, giving R-C≡C-OCH3, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane. So maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane, which also has an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a bridge between the two cyclohexane rings, and then the bridge is modified to form the substituent.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the number of steps and what each reagent does.

The target has an aldehyde, so perhaps one of the steps is oxidation to form the aldehyde. That would require a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized. So, if a primary alcohol is present, then using an oxidizing agent like KMnO4 or PCC would form the aldehyde.

Looking back, which options have steps that could form a primary alcohol?

Option D has steps that include O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is for breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups, but if the work-up is with a reductant like (CH3)2S, it would form aldehydes from double bonds.

Wait, but in option D, after step 3, which is ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH. Which is a basic solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexenyl group, then ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyls, which then can be oxidized further.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, going back to option B: if the steps are ethylation, elimination (forming a double bond), ozonolysis to break into carbonyls, and then perhaps a work-up.

After ozonolysis, the molecule would have carbonyl groups. Then, the aldehyde could be formed from one of those.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis step in option B cleaves the molecule into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But considering the target molecule, which has a single substituent with a hydroxyl group attached, perhaps that's not the case.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the correct sequence involves alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and then oxidation or reduction.

Alternatively, another approach: the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. So, for example, if the alkyne is treated with O3, then H2O, then HgSO4, H2SO4, that would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones if the alkyne is internal, but for terminal alkynes, it would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol.

Hmm.

Maybe the correct path is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a diol via hydroboration or some addition.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then oxidized to form an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about each step in option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, so perhaps this step
