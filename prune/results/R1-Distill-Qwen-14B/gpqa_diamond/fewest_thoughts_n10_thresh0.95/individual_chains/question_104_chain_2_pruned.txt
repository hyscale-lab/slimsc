Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The radial velocity method detected them, which I remember involves measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. So, I need to find the ratio of their periods, P2/P1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to this shift. Oh right, K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. But wait, the shift in wavelength is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula I remember is that the velocity (v) is approximately equal to (wavelength shift) / (wavelength) multiplied by the speed of light. But since both measurements are given in milliangstroms at the same wavelength, maybe I can just compare K directly based on the shifts.

So, the shift for #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and #2 is 7. So K2/K1 is 7/5=1.4. But wait, how does K relate to the orbital period?

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (2π) )^(1/3) )) ). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for the same star mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, no, actually, I think the relation is more involved.

Wait, let's think about the radial velocity method formula. The semi-amplitude K depends on several factors: the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (which I can assume is the same for both planets since they're both detected, so i≈90 degrees), and the orbital period.

The formula for K is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ). But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, I can approximate M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1 - e²) is 1.

Simplifying, K ≈ ( G * M_p )^(1/3) * ( (M_star) )^(-1/3) ) * ( P )^(-1/3) ) * (2π)^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period. Let me think. Since K is the velocity semi-amplitude, and velocity is related to the size of the orbit and the period.

Wait, the star's velocity is due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) / (1 + M_p / M_star)^(1/3). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, it's approximately K ≈ (v * sin i) ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) ), but maybe I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the relation between K and the orbital period. From the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / (P * day) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for orbital velocity. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula I remember is K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But maybe I can find the ratio of K for the two planets, K2/K1. Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (so M_p2 ≈ M_p1), the ratio K2/K1 would be proportional to (1/(P2/P1))^(1/3). Or wait, wait.

Wait, let's write the formula for K more carefully.

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_s, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / M_s )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3)

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_s)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But in this problem, M_p (Neptune mass) and M_s (Sun mass) are the same for both planets. So, the ratio K2/K1 = ( (1/P2)^(1/3) ) / ( (1/P1)^(1/3) ) ) = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, because K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me think again. If K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3), then K2 = (1/P2)^(1/3) * C, K1 = (1/P1)^(1/3) * C, where C is some constant based on other factors (like M_p and M_s, which are same for both).

So, K2/K1 = (1/P2)^(1/3) / (1/P1)^(1/3) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, let's compute K2/K1. From the question, K1 corresponds to 5 milliangstrom shift, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1 by a factor of 7/5 = 1.4.

So, K2/K1 = 1.4. Therefore, (K2/K1)^3 = (1.4)^3 = approximately 2.744.

Wait, but earlier equation: K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So,

(K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, (P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3

Therefore, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Since K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if K is larger, the period should be shorter, right? Because a higher K implies a higher velocity, which for a given orbital size (like semi-major axis) would mean a shorter period. Alternatively, if the star's velocity is higher, the orbit must be smaller, leading to a shorter period.

Wait, let me think about this again. The semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. If K is larger, the star is moving faster. That can happen if the planet is closer in (smaller orbit) because for a circular orbit, velocity is higher when closer (v = sqrt(GM/a)).

So, a larger K implies a smaller semi-major axis (a), which implies a shorter orbital period (since P² is proportional to a³ for a given star mass, from Kepler's third law).

So, if K2 > K1, then a2 < a1, so P2 < P1.

But according to our earlier calculation, P2/P1 is about 0.36, so P2 is shorter than P1. That makes sense because K2 is larger than K1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the answer would be about 0.36 times. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

Alternatively, let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i ≈1, and M_p << M_star, then:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2
