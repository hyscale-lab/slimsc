Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, their mean decay distance depends on some factors like their energy, mass, and width. Let me think about the formula I should use here.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Oh, right, since they're all in GeV and MeV, I should convert them to the same unit. Let's see, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

I recall that the mean lifetime (which relates to the decay width) is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the decay distance would be the speed multiplied by the lifetime, right? Because the particle moves at some speed, and takes a certain time to decay, so distance = speed * time.

But wait, since X is a resonance, its lifetime is very short. The mean decay distance is called the decay length. The formula I think is L = c * τ, but I'm not sure if I should consider relativistic effects here. Because if the meson is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame could be longer due to time dilation. Hmm, how does that work?

So the lifetime in the rest frame is τ = ħ / Γ. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime in the lab frame is longer by the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) = E/(m c²). Wait, because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c squared. So gamma would be E/(m c²). Hmm, but wait, the units are GeV, so I need to handle that.

Wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ / Γ. But because the particle is moving, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. So the total decay length is L = v * γ τ, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, since L = (v γ) τ = (β γ c) τ, where β is v/c.

Alternatively, another approach: The total decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The decay width is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ (proper time) is ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to gamma (time dilation). So the mean lifetime observed is τ_lab = γ τ. Then, the decay distance is L = v τ_lab. Since v is approximately c for a high-energy particle, but perhaps we can just take v = c to approximate.

Wait, but let me get the formula right. The average decay length is given by L = c * τ_lab. Or is it (gamma * beta * c) * tau? I remember the formula as L = (v gamma) * tau_rest, but since v is about c, it's approximately c gamma tau_rest.

Alternatively, I think the formula is L = (gamma * c * tau_rest) * beta. Wait, maybe I should write it as L = gamma * beta * c * tau_rest. Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), and beta is v/c. So gamma beta is (v/(c sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2))) ) which is v/(c) divided by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is the same as v/(sqrt(c^2 - v^2)) ). Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the decay length L is given by L = (E / m) * (c tau_rest) * (something?), but I'm not certain. Wait, I think the formula is L = (E/(m c²)) * c * tau_rest.

Wait, let me try to derive it. The total energy E is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). The proper lifetime is tau_rest = hbar / Gamma. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed is tau = gamma tau_rest. So the decay length is L = v tau = v gamma tau_rest.

But v is approximately c for particles with high energy, so v ≈ c. So L ≈ c gamma tau_rest.

So putting it all together: L ≈ c * (gamma) * (tau_rest) = c * (E/(m c²)) * (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, let me write that more clearly. Gamma is the decay width, which equals hbar / tau_rest. So tau_rest = hbar / Gamma.

So substituting into L: L = c * (E/(m c²)) * (hbar / Gamma).

Simplify that: L = (E hbar) / (m c Gamma) ) * c. Let me see:

Wait, wait, let me re-express:

L = c * (E/(m c²)) ) * (hbar / Gamma).

Because gamma is E/(m c²), and tau_rest is hbar / Gamma.

Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

1. Compute gamma: gamma = E/(m c²). E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so E/m = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma ≈ (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV c²) * c²? Wait, no, the units are a bit tricky.

Wait, E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), E (in GeV) is equal to m c² when m is in GeV/c². But in our case, let's see: m is given as 1.2 GeV. But wait, the mass is in GeV, which is actually GeV/c². Because when you have E=mc², m in kg, E in J. But when using units like GeV, it's better to have m in GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me clarify:

The mass m_X is given as 1.2 GeV. But the standard unit for mass is GeV/c². So perhaps the problem statement is using m_X as 1.2 GeV/c². So when calculating gamma, which is E/(m c²), E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

But wait, perhaps I should handle the units more precisely. Let's make sure all units are in SI units.

But that could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1 can simplify the calculations. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of the formula again.

Another approach: The decay length L is given by L = (E * hbar * c) / (m * Gamma).

Wait, that makes sense. Because:

- E is the energy of the particle. Since E is much larger than m c², the particle is moving at speeds close to c.

- hbar has units of GeV·s when using E in GeV.

Wait, let's check the units.

E is in GeV.

m is in GeV/c². Because mass m = E_rest / c². So when m is given as 1.2 GeV, it's actually 1.2 GeV/c².

Gamma (Γ) is the decay width, which is in GeV (since it's given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV).

hbar is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

L = (E * ħ * c) / (m * Γ )

Let me plug in the numbers:

E = 8 GeV

m = 1.2 GeV/c²

Γ = 0.32 GeV

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So,

L = (8 GeV * 6.582e-25 GeV s * 3e8 m/s) / (1.2 GeV/c² * 0.32 GeV )

Wait, wait, let me make sure the units work out.

Wait, the numerator is E (GeV) * ħ (GeV s) * c (m/s). So:

GeV * GeV s * m/s = GeV² m.

Denominator is m (GeV/c²) * Γ (GeV) = (GeV/c²) * GeV = GeV² / c².

So overall, L has units (GeV² m) / (GeV² / c²) ) = m * c².

Wait, that's not right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let's recompute the units step by step.

E is in GeV.

m is in GeV/c².

Γ is in GeV.

ħ is in GeV s.

c is in m/s.

So the formula is:

L = [E (GeV) * ħ (GeV s) * c (m/s)] / [m (GeV/c²) * Γ (GeV)]

Let's compute the units:

Numerator: GeV * GeV s * m/s = GeV² m.

Denominator: (GeV/c²) * GeV = GeV² / c².

So the entire fraction's units are (GeV² m) / (GeV² / c²) ) = m * c².

Wait, but that gives units of m * c², which is not correct for L. So I must have messed up the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I should review the equation. Maybe I forgot a term.

Wait, the correct formula for the decay length is L = (gamma * beta * c * tau_rest), where tau_rest is the proper lifetime.

Tau_rest is hbar / Gamma.

Gamma is the decay width, which is given as 0.32 GeV.

So computing tau_rest: tau_rest = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, gamma is E/(m c²). But in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, E and m are in the same units, so gamma is E/m. In this case, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is v/c. For a particle with gamma ≈6.6667, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ 1, since gamma is large. So beta ≈ 1.

So, L ≈ gamma * beta * c * tau_rest.

So, substituting the numbers:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

beta ≈ 1.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau_rest = 6.582e-25 s / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

L = 6.6667 * 1 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

First, 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2e9 (since 6.6667 is roughly 2/3, so 2/3 *3e8=2e8, wait wait, no. 6.6667 is 20/3, so 20/3 *3e8 =20e8=2e9 m/s.

Wait, wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So 6.6667 *3e8 = (20/3)*3e8 =20e8 =2e9 m/s.

Wait no, because 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. So 6.6667 *3e8 is 2e9? No, 6.6667 *3e8 = 2e9? Because 6.6667 is about 2/3 of 10, but 3e8 * 6.6667 is 2e9.

Wait, 3e8 * 6.6667 = 3 *6.6667e8=20e8=2e9? No, 3e8 is 3*1e8, so 3e8 *6.6667=20e8=2e9 m/s. Hmm, yes.

Then multiply by tau_rest, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = (2e9 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) )

Wait, no, wait: the calculation was L = 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8=2e9 m/s? Wait, 3e8 *6.6667 is 1.999999e9 ~2e9 m/s.

So 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2e9)*(2.056875e-24) ) meters.

Multiply 2e9 by 2.056875e-24: 2 *2.056875 = 4.11375, and exponents 1e9 *1e-24=1e-15.

So 4.11375e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.11375e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. But why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I approximated beta as 1, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, because gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666667. Let's compute beta more accurately.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2).

So, 1 - beta^2=1/gamma^2.

beta^2=1 - 1/gamma^2.

gamma =8/1.2= 20/3 ≈6.66667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 =400/9≈44.44444.

1/gamma^2 =9/400=0.0225.

So, beta^2=1 -0.0225=0.9775.

Beta= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887, not exactly 1. So let's correct that.

So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau_rest.

So, computing gamma * beta = (20/3)*0.9887.

(20/3) is approximately 6.6667.

6.6667 *0.9887≈6.6667*(0.9887)= let's compute:

6.6667 *0.9887.

6 *0.9887=5.9322.

0.6667 *0.9887≈0.6586.

Total approximately 5.9322 + 0.6586≈6.5908.

So, gamma * beta ≈6.5908.

Now, L = gamma * beta *c * tau_rest.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_rest=6.582e-25 /0.32=2.056875e-24 s.

So, L=6.5908 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 6.5908 *3e8 = 1.97724e9 m/s.

Then, 1.97724e9 *2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 1.97724 *2.056875 ≈4.0655.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-24=1e-15.

So, L≈4.0655e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was about 5e-15, but this calculation gives option B as the correct.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_{\text{rest}}
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) (in natural units where \( c = 1 \)):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The relationship between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \implies \beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{44.4444} \approx 0.9775.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
Substitute \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_{\text{rest}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_{\text{rest}} = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = (6.6667)(0.9887) \approx 6.5908.
\]

Then, compute \( c \tau_{\text{rest}} \):

\[
c \tau_{\text{rest}} = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (6.5908)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
