Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. And we're told that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the interval x=1 to x=3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, wait. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So the wave function should be zero for x < 1 and x > 3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when is this equal to zero? Let me set it equal to zero and solve for x.

So, (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i = 0.

That equation would imply that each part must be zero. Let's separate real and imaginary parts. The real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5i.

Wait, wait. Actually, the wave function is a complex number. The given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So for the wave function to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. But wait, the imaginary part is -0.5, which is a constant. So that can't be zero unless 0.5 is zero, which it's not. That doesn't make sense. Did I misinterpret the wave function?

Wait, maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^(-i something), but that's not what the question says. The given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a complex number with a real part and an imaginary part that's fixed at 0.5i. So that's a problem because if the wave function is zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. But here, the imaginary part is -0.5, which isn't zero. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps this is an eigenstate where the wave function is zero outside the interval x=1 to x=3. But the given wave function isn't zero anywhere, unless a is zero, which can't be the case because then the wave function would be -0.5i everywhere, which doesn't vanish. So maybe the wave function is such that it's zero outside x=1 to x=3, but within that interval, it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) − 0.5i.

But for the wave function to be zero outside x=1 to x=3, that can't be the case here because ψ(x) is a complex function. So perhaps the given wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. But how?

Wait, perhaps the wave function is such that it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by a step function that is 1 between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the question says the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, but the given expression is for within that interval. So perhaps the wave function is zero when x is outside 1 and 3, but inside, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the wave function can't have a non-zero value outside, but within it's given as a function.

Wait, perhaps the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the question states that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So that would imply that the wave function is zero outside that interval. So the wave function is:

ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3,
ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

Wait, but that's not possible because the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which can't be zero unless a is zero, which would make the entire wave function -0.5i, which is nonzero. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait a second, perhaps the wave function is a product of a real function and a complex exponential. But the given expression doesn't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is in a region where it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and it's zero outside that region. But that would require that within the region, the wave function is non-zero, and outside, it's zero. So maybe the question is implying that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is zero outside that interval, and the given expression applies within that interval.

But then, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So within the interval, the wave function is non-zero, and outside it's zero. But wait, how can that be? Because if the wave function is zero outside, then for the wave function to be valid, it must be continuous. So the wave function must approach zero at x=1 and x=3.

Wait, let's think about the boundary conditions. The wave function should be continuous and have a continuous derivative if the potential is such. But perhaps in this case, for simplicity, it's a piecewise function where it's zero outside 1 and 3, and the given function inside.

But then, at x=1, the wave function would be (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i, and outside, it's zero. So that's a jump from some finite value to zero, which would be discontinuous. That's not possible unless the wave function is zero in the region, which contradicts.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me read the question again.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When measuring, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 and 3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If the wave function is zero outside, then within the region, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and outside, zero. But that would mean that the wave function is undefined outside, but the question says that when measuring, none are found outside, so perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3.

So the wave function ψ(x) is zero outside [1,3], and inside, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that would imply that for x=1, the wave function is (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i, and for x=3, it's (a/sqrt(4)) - 0.5i = a/(2) - 0.5i.

But for the wave function to be zero outside, perhaps the given function is non-zero only in the interval, and zero elsewhere. But then, the integral of |ψ|^2 over all space must be 1 (normalization). So let's compute the normalization.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero elsewhere.

The normalization condition is integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1.

So |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 + 2*(a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5) * Re{something}, wait no. Wait, because ψ(x) is complex, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

Wait, ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) [real part] + (-0.5i) [imaginary part].

So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (-0.5)^2.

Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3: a² ln(1+x) from 1 to 3 = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function as given, when squared, includes the imaginary part. But I'm assuming that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero outside. So the normalization is just the integral over 1 to 3.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is B) 0.85.


The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle, given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where the particle is confined to the interval \(1 \leq x \leq 3\), and the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition for the wave function requires that:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside \(1 \leq x \leq 3\), the normalization integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **Integral of \(\frac{a^2}{1+x}\):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. **Integral of \(0.25\):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
