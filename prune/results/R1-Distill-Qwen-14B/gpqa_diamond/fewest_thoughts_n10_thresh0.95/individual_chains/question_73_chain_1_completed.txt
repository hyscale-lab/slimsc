Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and figuring out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities because of the way velocities add in special relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). So for v_rel, I can plug in their speeds.

So astronaut 1 has v1 = 0.6c, astronaut 2 has v2 = 0.5c. Plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute numerator and denominator separately. 

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So denominator is 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. That's one part; looking at the options, some have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, so E_total would be E1 + E2, where E for each is gamma * m c². Wait, but wait: for astronaut 1, mass is 2m, moving at 0.6c. For astronaut 2, mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

So I need to calculate gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut 1: v =0.6c. v²/c² =0.36. 1 -0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma =1/0.8 =1.25. So E1 = gamma * mass * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² =2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.75)) = approx 1.1547. So E2= gamma *3m c² = 1.1547 *3m c². Let's compute that: 3 *1.1547 is about 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 mc², approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait another thing. Do I have to consider anything else? Because when two objects are moving in the same direction, their energies are additive in the same frame. So I think that's the correct approach here.

Looking at the options now. The relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's the one.

Option D has E=5mc², which would be if I just added the rest energies (2m +3m =5m) but that's only rest mass energy and doesn't account for kinetic energy. So no, option D is wrong.

Wait, but wait again: the problem says "the total energy of the system." So system's rest frame? Or do I have to compute the sum of their energies as seen from the same frame? Because in the given problem, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, but in their own frames. Wait, no, the problem says their speeds in the positive x-direction, but I'm assuming all velocities are measured in the same inertial frame, like the rest frame of the Earth or whatever frame is considering both astronauts moving. Hmm, the problem says they travel at those speeds in the positive x-direction, so perhaps we are to compute the relative speed from one astronaut's perspective, but the total energy is in the same frame.

Wait, no. The problem is perhaps considering the two astronauts in the same frame, so their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. So the relative speed between them would be as we calculated, 0.14c. And the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

So yes, the relative speed is as we calculated, and the total energy is the sum of their energies. So option C matches.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

For the given speeds \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

- Numerator: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
- \(\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36\), so \(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64\)
- \(\sqrt{0.64} = 0.8\), so \(\gamma = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
- \(\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.25\), so \(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.75\)
- \(\sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866\), so \(\gamma = \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- Total energy: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\)

This matches **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
