Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, labeled A to D.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. From what I recall, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In other words, the physics shouldn't change if you switch frames of reference that are moving at constant velocity relative to each other. The Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, so the effective theory SMEFT, which is an extension of the SM, should also respect this. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So symmetry 1 is a must.

Next up is Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So it's a bigger symmetry group. The Poincare group encompasses all the isometries of Minkowski spacetime. Now, does SMEFT respect this? Well, the SM does respect Poincare symmetry, so any effective theory built upon it should too. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which means it's valid below a certain scale. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to match the symmetries of the SM. So the operators must be Poincare invariant. So symmetry 2 (Poincare) must also be respected.

Moving on to CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles into their antiparticles, and parity reflects space. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, certain processes like kaon mixing violate CP. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, would SMEFT require its operators to respect it? I don't think so. SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So symmetry 3, CP, isn't a must. So operators may or may not respect CP symmetry, but it's not a requirement.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that the SM respects CPT symmetry. The general idea is that the combination of C, P, and T transformations should leave the physics invariant. Even in cases where individual symmetries are broken, the combination is conserved. For example, in processes that violate CP, T must be violated to compensate, thereby preserving CPT. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, symmetry 4 must be respected.

So putting it all together: which symmetries are required for all SMEFT operators?

Symmetry 1 (Lorentz) must be respected. Symmetry 2 (Poincare) must be respected. Symmetry 3 (CP) is not required. Symmetry 4 (CPT) is required.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but I thought Poincare includes Lorentz. Because Poincare is the combination of translations and Lorentz. So if Poincare is respected, does that automatically imply Lorentz symmetry? Or are they independent? Hmm. Wait, no. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if all operators in SMEFT respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

Wait, but in the question, the options are whether each symmetry must be respected. So if an operator respects Poincare, does it necessarily respect Lorentz? Yes. But the question is phrased as which must be respected. So if the symmetry group includes Lorentz, then operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

So given that, the correct symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So options 1,2,4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but what about the option C? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4.

So according to my reasoning, the correct answer is C, which includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare is a larger group that includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it doesn't need to separately respect Lorentz because Poincare includes it. But the question is, which symmetries must each operator respect? So if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. So if the question says, which must be respected, then both 1 and 2 are necessary? Or is it that 2 implies 1, so only 2 is needed. But this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is Poincare symmetric, it's also Lorentz symmetric. So does that mean that operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or that Poincare implies Lorentz, so it's sufficient to mention Poincare? 

In the context of the question, the options list them as separate. So if the operator must respect Poincare, that includes Lorentz, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected, so both 1 and 2 are correct. So all operators must respect both, hence option C.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare is a larger symmetry, so if it's respected, Lorentz is automatically respected. So the answer would include 2, but 1 is redundant. But the options don't have an option with just 2 and 4. So perhaps the correct answer is C, which includes both 1 and 2.

Another angle: SMEFT is built from SM operators. The SM respects Poincare symmetry. So SMEFT operators must also preserve Poincare, which includes Lorentz as a subset. So in the SMEFT, any operator must be Poincare invariant, which implies Lorentz as well. So both 1 and 2 are correct, but 2 is a bigger symmetry that includes 1. So the correct answer must include both 1 and 2. So option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries listed in the question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures invariance under Lorentz transformations, such as rotations and boosts. Since the Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT, being an extension of the SM, must also respect it. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) is a requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry encompasses Lorentz symmetry and includes translations in space and time. Since SMEFT is built from operators consistent with the SM, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) is a requirement.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The SM does not universally respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation occurs in certain processes like kaon mixing). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is derived from the SM, all SMEFT operators must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry (4) is a requirement.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). These correspond to option **C**.

Answer: C
