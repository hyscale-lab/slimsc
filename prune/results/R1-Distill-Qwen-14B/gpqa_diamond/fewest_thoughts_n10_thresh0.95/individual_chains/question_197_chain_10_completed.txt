--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X, which undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Then, I have to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the structure of compound X.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range that often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the reaction involves HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's about an elimination or an acid-catalyzed process. Wait, another IR peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton or possibly a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have broad singlets around 10-12 ppm, but aldehydes are around 9-10. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with D2O, but I'm not sure. Let me think. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. But maybe it's an aldehyde. However, another possibility is a phenolic -OH, but those are usually broader and might be around 5-7 ppm, but sometimes upfield. Hmm.

Wait, but the peak is at 10.5, which is quite upfield for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but the chemical shift can vary. Also, aldehyde protons are typically sharp singlets, but the question says it's a broad singlet (bs). So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But I'm a bit confused. Let me see the other signals.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) might be from electron-withdrawing groups, while the upfield (7.2) might be from electron-donating groups. So maybe there are two substituents on the benzene ring, one in para position, each causing different shifts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents in para, but maybe one is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another is an electron-donating group (like an ethyl group or something).

Wait, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet with 2H, and 7.2 is another doublet with 2H. This suggests that each pair is adjacent, perhaps para to each other. So for example, the benzene ring has two substituents, each in para positions, causing the doublets. So maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Next, looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 2.9 region, integrating for 1H. That might be a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to another group, perhaps an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or maybe a CH group next to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group in a branched structure.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating for 2H. This could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or part of a larger substituent. Maybe part of an ethyl chain or something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H. That's typical for a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH. Like in an isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2), the methyl would be a doublet. Or maybe a CH2CH(CH3)2 structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. That's usually a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: let's think about the structure of X.

We have a benzene ring (from the aromatic NMR signals) with substituents. One substituent is probably a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1), since that's a strong peak. So maybe it's a phenyl ketone or a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, the IR also has a peak at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. Could this be an O-H stretch? So perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group, like a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show a broad peak in the lower ppm for an -OH. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually sharp. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the IR 3400-2500 is from an N-H stretch, but I don't see any amines in the options. Wait, the options are all either acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak: if it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. But in the NMR, the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) suggest perhaps a chain attached to the ring. Maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl group.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Assume the benzene ring has substituents at the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or acid), and the other is an alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR:

- The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets: So the ring has two substituents, each causing the neighboring H's to split into doublets. So perhaps one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and the other is an electron-donating group (like an alkyl chain). So substituents are in the para positions.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid proton, but I'd expect a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but the broadness is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenol, but that usually appears lower in the NMR.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet. If it's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. But a ketone doesn't have a proton. Wait, unless it's an aldehyde.

So if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But the 10.5 is a bit high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, the IR at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the carbonyl (O=C-O in carboxylic acid). But carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, which fit the IR data. So that's possible.

Wait, but in the NMR, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would appear as a broad peak, but in the data, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Could that be the -COOH proton? Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, but then where would the carbonyl be?

Wait, perhaps compound X is a benzoyl group attached to an alkyl chain. Let me think. The IR has 1720, which is about the right wavenumber for a ketone (maybe a bit high, but possible). So maybe it's a aryl ketone.

But then, the 10.5 ppm would have to be something else. Let me think about the other NMR data.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2. 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH group. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl group, maybe from an ethyl chain.

Wait, putting it together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone (so O=C-R), where R is a chain like CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (CO-) attached to a side chain. The side chain could be something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the NMR.

The CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H) might be a CH connected to the carbonyl. Then, the CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl group attached to that CH. So, perhaps a structure like (CH2)CH(CH3), but more accurately, maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another possibility is that the side chain is a propyl group with a branching. Let's see: perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group (CO-CH2-CH2-CH3), but that might not fit the NMR. Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene ring, so the chain would be attached to the ring via the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzophenone derivative, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyloxy group, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as a ketone group attached to the benzene ring, with an ethyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR also shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. So maybe there's an ethyl group somewhere.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) attached to a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, that would give a chain like Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-..., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoyl? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group attached to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options provided, let's see what each option looks like.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Structure: a phenyl group attached to the 4 position of propanoic acid. So, propanoic acid with a phenyl group on the second carbon. Wait, that would be (4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the para positions. But I don't think that has a carbonyl group, so maybe it doesn't fit the IR data.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. The carboxylic acid would have the 1720 cm-1 peak and the 10.5 ppm proton.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: That's a para-xylene with a sec-butyl and methyl group. Again, no carbonyl, so maybe not matching the IR.

So, looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. Let's see if that fits the data.

The IR would have a strong O-H stretch (broad) around 3000-3500 cm-1 (which matches the first IR peak), and a carbonyl at 1720 (matches the IR data). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are likely aromatic C=C stretching.

The NMR for option C would be:

- The carboxylic acid proton at around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet. The 10.5 ppm peak in the data fits this.

The benzene ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). The sec-butyl group has a structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH3 attached via the second carbon.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene in option C are COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions relative to each substituent. Wait, but if COOH is at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4, then the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6.

In such a case, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, making them deshielded (higher ppm). The protons in positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the sec-butyl group, which is an electron-donating group, making them more shielded (lower ppm). So in the NMR, we would see two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to COOH (higher ppm) and another for those adjacent to the sec-butyl (lower ppm). The data shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which matches this scenario.

Now, looking at the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That would be the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, let's clarify. The structure of sec-butyl is actually -(CH2)2CHCH3, but wait, no, that's the iso-butyl. Wait, no. Let me correct.

Actually, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that can't be right. No, wait. The correct structure: the butyl group has four carbons. The "sec-" refers to the position of the attachment. So, in a butyl group, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but when it's a sec-butyl, the attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me think. For a butyl group, the straight chain is CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure for a sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-R, where R is the group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that's not correct. Oh, wait, perhaps I should draw it.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached via the second carbon. Wait, that can't be right because the butyl group has four carbons. Wait, no: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, the correct is:

The four carbons are arranged as follows: the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, the group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that can't be, because that would only be three carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that's three carbons. No, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH3 attached via the second carbon. Wait, but that would be an iso-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing between iso-butyl and sec-butyl. Let me clarify:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain).
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2 (attached via the central carbon).
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) (attached via the second carbon).

Wait, no. Actually, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

The butyl group has four carbons. For a sec-butyl, the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, that's four carbons. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that's only three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed carefully.

Assuming the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would have a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene ring. So, in the NMR, the CH2 group adjacent to the ring would be split into a multiplet. The CH group (the one attached to the CH2) would be another multiplet. And the terminal CH2CH3 would show up as a triplet or something.

But in the NMR data, we have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH3 group. So, that would correspond to the end of the substituent.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH group. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to the ring via a CH2 group.

Wait, putting it all together, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. That would make it an isopropyl group, but wait, that's part of a longer chain.

Wait, let's try to model option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent: the sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's only three carbons, but butyl has four. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), which is four carbons: the point of attachment is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that would be five carbons? No, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but that would be a four-carbon group? I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps I should move forward.

So, the NMR data for the substituent:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group in the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to the CH group, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl of the substituent.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). But that's only three carbons. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3). Hmm, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), which would be a pentyl group. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. So, the substituent attached to the benzene is a propyl group with a methyl on the second carbon. That would be a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could correspond to a CH and adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, and 0.9 (t,3H) the terminal CH2CH3.

This would suggest a structure where the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. That would make the structure CH2CH2CH(CH3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH2 group attached to the benzene. But that's getting too vague.

Wait, considering the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure. However, if that's the case, then the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), which matches the data.

- The substituent's CH2 group next to the ring (if any) would show up as a triplet, perhaps, but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2. So, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then, the CH2 group (attached to the ring) would be split by the adjacent CH, leading to a multiplet at around 2.9 ppm (the CH group) and the adjacent CH2 might be at 1.7 ppm. The CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have a methyl group further down.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: if the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)), then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring (the one next to the benzene) would have two protons as a triplet, perhaps.

Wait, but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), suggesting a CH group, not a CH2. So perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to the ring, with two CH2 groups, such as in a propyl chain with branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Then, the structure would be:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH2 - CH(CH3).

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two protons on the CH2 next to the CH group.

- The CH group (in the middle) would have one proton, appearing as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) group would have the methyl as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (since the CH is attached to the CH2 and the methyl).

- And the terminal CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3), which is a pentyl group with a methyl branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. Let me clarify: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). But that would be a four-carbon substituent?

No, wait. Let's count the carbons in a substituent. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which has four carbons. So, the structure is:

Benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group (which has a CH2CH3 group attached to it). So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Therefore, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), making it a four-carbon substituent (the CH2 is the first carbon, then the CH is the second, and the CH2CH3 is on the second carbon).

In that case, the substituent would have the following groups:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: this would have two protons. Considering coupling with the adjacent CH, their chemical shift might be around 2.5-3.0 ppm.

- The CH group would have one proton, which would split into a multiplet (due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 and perhaps the CH2CH3). That would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would have three protons, appearing as a triplet at around 1.0-1.5 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which might correspond to the methyl group on the CH. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), which would be a four-carbon group. So, the substituent would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

But wait, that would only be three carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So, two CH2 groups followed by a CH with a methyl.

In that case, the substituent would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)

Then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say at position 1) would have protons around 2.5-3.0 ppm, perhaps a triplet, due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

- The middle CH2 would have protons around 1.5-2.0 ppm, maybe as a quartet.

- The CH(CH3) would have protons around 2.5-3.0 ppm, maybe as a multiplet.

- The CH3 on the CH would be a doublet at around 1.4 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which would correspond to the CH(CH3) group.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 groups.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl on the CH.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the terminal CH2CH3. Wait, but in this substituent, there's no terminal CH2CH3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is longer. Maybe it's a pentyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the substituent would have:

- The first CH2 (attached to benzene) would have protons around 2.5-3.0 ppm.

- The next CH2 would have protons around 1.5-2.0 ppm.

- The CH would have one proton, appearing as a multiplet around 2.5-3.0 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet around 1.0 ppm.

But that doesn't quite fit all the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH(CH3) group. That would be a longer chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the reaction part now.

The reaction is between compound X and red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) to methylene groups, usually under high-temperature conditions. Alternatively, they can be used in other reactions, but Wolff-Kishner is a common one.

Wait, but another possibility is the use of H2O with HIO4 for cleavage of diols, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used to deoxygenate carbonyl groups. For example, if X has a ketone group, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to an alkane. So, the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Wait, but the IR data for X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, so the product would lose that.

So, if X is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent, the reaction would convert the ketone to a methylene group, producing a toluene derivative.

Wait, but looking at the options, some are benzoic acids and others are substituted benzenes without carbonyls. So, perhaps X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction removes it.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not be a Wolff-Kishner because that's for ketones. Benzoic acid would need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution. If X has a leaving group, perhaps the HI would substitute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester, but that's usually under basic conditions.

Wait, maybe X is an alkyne, but that's not supported by the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, which would react with HI, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward. If X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction reduces it, then the product would have a CH2 group in place of the carbonyl.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative without a carbonyl. Option B is a similar structure but with isobutyl and methyl groups. Options A and C have a carbonyl group (propanoic acid and benzoic acid, respectively).

Wait, if X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the reaction would have to eliminate the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation under certain conditions. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would cause that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the acid into a different functional group. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkane from a ketone. So, if X is a benzophenone derivative, the reaction would convert the ketone into CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR data includes a strong O-H stretch, which would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used to reduce carbonyl groups to alkanes. So, if X has a ketone, the product would be a substituted toluene without the carbonyl.

So, for example, if X is 4-(propanoyl)benzoic acid, the reaction would reduce the propanoyl group to a CH2 group, resulting in 4-(ethyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. Wait, but elimination usually requires a base, and HI is an acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, which ones would result from the reduction of a carbonyl group.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: that's a toluene derivative with substituents in the para positions. So, perhaps X was a ketone, and the reaction converted the ketone to a CH2 group.

For example, if X was 4-(propionyl)benzaldehyde, the reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2, producing 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to CH2, making toluene.

Wait, but let's go back to the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid, but then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not affect it. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the reaction would reduce it to CH2.

But in the options, the only product that doesn't have a carbonyl is options B and D. So, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone to a CH2 group.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That has a propanoic acid group. But the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not affect the acid group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The initial compound X has a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (perhaps a carboxylic acid or a ketone) and some substituents. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carbonyl group.

If X is a ketone, the product would be a toluene derivative.

If X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect it, or maybe it's converted into something else, but I don't know.

Looking at the options, the products without a carbonyl group are B and D.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: again, a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and methyl group.

Now, let's consider the structure of X. If X is a ketone, then the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Suppose X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, making 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. The IR at 1720 cm-1 wouldn't fit an aldehyde, as aldehydes have lower wavenumber for the C=O (around 1700-1720 cm-1, so that fits). The 10.5 ppm peak could be the aldehyde proton.

But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and appear as sharp singlets. The NMR shows a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't affect it. But the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are more likely to reduce a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming an alkene. But I don't see any data supporting that.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a substitution where a hydroxyl group is replaced by HI. But in that case, the product would have a bromine or iodine substituent, which isn't present in the options.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The initial compound X has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (like a benzoic acid). When treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into a methyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the HI replaces a leaving group, but I don't see any in X's structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group in a ketone to CH2. For example, if X is a benzophenone derivative, the product would be a toluene derivative.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the reaction would have to form this from X, which would have a ketone group in position 1.

So, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone. The reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2, making 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not exactly option D. Option D has a methyl and a sec-butyl in para positions.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, the product after reduction would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which matches option D.

So, perhaps that's the case. Therefore, the correct answer would be option D.

But let me cross-check.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone (structure: Ph-CO-Ph with substituents?), but wait, benzophenone is Ar-CO-Ar. But in our case, X has a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, perhaps as a ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone (COCH3) substituent. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, producing 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is option D.

But wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Oh, the numbering would make it 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methyl, but if the methyl is from the reduction of the ketone, then the product would have the methyl in the position where the ketone was.

So, if the original structure was 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone (meaning the ketone is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4), then the product after reduction would have a methyl at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4, making it 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

But wait, no. The reduction of the ketone would produce CH2, but acetophenone is Ph-CO-CH3. Reducing that would give Ph-CH2-CH3, which is ethylbenzene, but that's not matching the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propiophenone derivative, like Ph-CO-CH2R, where R is the substituent. Then, the reduction would produce Ph-CH2-CH2R.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled here. Another approach: considering the options, the product after reaction is either a substituted benzene without a carbonyl group or a benzoic acid (if the reaction doesn't affect the carbonyl).

But since the reaction uses red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for reductions, the product is likely to lose the carbonyl group, leading to a CH2 group.

So, the correct answer is likely option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction between compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The spectroscopic data provided for compound X indicates the presence of a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (C=O), and possibly a carboxylic acid or aldehyde functional group. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H or N-H), 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), and 1610 cm⁻¹ & 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data further supports the presence of a benzene ring with para-substituents, a carbonyl group, and an alkyl chain.

### Analysis of Compound X
- **IR Data**: The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H group, and the strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ketone.
- **NMR Data**:
  - The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) peak is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.
  - The aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.
  - The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate an alkyl chain with a methyl group and a terminal ethyl group.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones or aldehydes) to methylene groups. If compound X contains a ketone, the reaction would replace the carbonyl group with a CH₂ group, resulting in a substituted toluene derivative.

### Evaluation of Options
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group, but the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely reduce the carbonyl group, making this option inconsistent with the reaction conditions.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a para-substituted benzene with an isobutyl and methyl group. However, it lacks a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the IR data for compound X.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. While the IR and NMR data for compound X could match this structure, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group, making this option unlikely as the final product.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl group. If compound X is a ketone derivative, such as 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH₂ group, forming this product. This aligns with the reaction conditions and the spectroscopic data.

### Conclusion
The reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carbonyl group to a CH₂ group, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.
