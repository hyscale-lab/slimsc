Alright, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It's a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, I think it's part of the cubic system actually. Or maybe it's a separate system. Anyway, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So that's a rhombohedral lattice, right? So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, with a = b = c, and all angles equal.

I'm trying to recall the formula for interplanar distance. Oh right, the general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²)(cos²α + cos²β + cos³γ - 1)/ (1 + cosα cosβ cosγ - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ) )) or something like that. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. I think the formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l² + ... )) Hmm, no, perhaps it's better to look up the formula for a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, I think for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using a simplified version because a = b = c and all angles are equal. So the formula might be d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²) * (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) ) / (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ) )) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + terms involving cosines of the angles).

Alternatively, I think the general formula for d is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) [ 1 - (cosα + cosβ cosγ)/(1 - cosα cosβ cosγ + cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ) ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula specific to the rhombohedral system. Since a = b = c and all angles are α, maybe we can express it more simply.

I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all the lattice parameters are same. The general formula for d_{hkl} is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) / (1 - cos α) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not quite right. Alternatively, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1/a²) ) - (h² + k² + l²) (cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ) / (1 - cosα cosβ cosγ) ) )

Wait, I'm not confident. Maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factor, but that might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where all edges are equal and angles are equal.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² [ 1 - (cos α)/(1 - cos α cos β cos γ + (cos α cos β + cos α cos γ + cos β cos γ )) ]

Wait, maybe that's more accurate. But honestly, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for d-spacing in rhombohedral systems.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using the relation in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is 2π divided by the magnitude of the reciprocal vector.

Wait, the real space vectors are a, b, c. The reciprocal vectors are (2π/a)(h, k, l) - but no, that's only for a cubic system. For a general system, the reciprocal vectors are more complicated.

Wait, in a general crystal, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector (h, k, l) is given by 1/d_{hkl}.

The formula is:

(1/d_{hkl})² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) [ 1 - (cos α (h² + k² + l² - 2kl cos γ)) ) ] 

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 - (cosα cosβ cosγ) + (cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ)/2]

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to find the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: For a rhombohedral lattice, since a = b = c and α = β = γ = θ, the formula for d_{hkl} simplifies. 

I think the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - ( (h +k + l)² (1 - cosθ) ) / 3 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, in some sources, I recall that when the angles are equal, the formula involves terms with cosθ.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. For a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula is more involved.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ( (1/a²) (1 - cosα cosβ cosγ + (cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ)/2) ) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated, but perhaps it's applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for a rhombohedral lattice as follows:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, let me think. In a rhombohedral system, the angles α = β = γ = θ. So maybe the formula can be written in terms of θ.

The Miller indices are (hkl), so for (111), h=1, k=1, l=1.

I think the general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that's a possibility. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in a cubic system (where θ=90 degrees), cos 90 = 0. So the formula would reduce to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

So if that's the case, then in this problem, θ is 30 degrees, so cosθ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Plugging into the formula: d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2(1 +1 +1) * cos30° )

Wait, wait, the term 2(hk + hl + kl) times cosθ. So for (111), hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 = 3.

So 2 * 3 * cosθ = 6 * cos30.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6 cos30).

Let me compute that.

First, cos30 is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative, which would make the denominator imaginary. That can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong.

Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps the formula is incorrect. Maybe I missed a negative sign.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but then for cubic, cosθ=0, so d=a/sqrt(3) for (111), which is correct. So perhaps the angle is being considered as the angle between the vectors, but in a rhombohedral structure, the angles between the edges are 30 degrees, which is less than 90.

Wait, but wait, cos30 is positive, so adding 2*(3)*0.866 gives 5.196, so (1+1+1) is 3, plus 5.196 is 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30) = a / sqrt(3 + 5.196) = a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a / 2.863.

Given that a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494.

But looking at the options, all are around 9-10 Angstrom. So that's way off. So I must have something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ, but as earlier, that gives negative denominator which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which for cubic gives correct results when θ=90, as cos90=0, so d=a/sqrt(3).

But in this case, cosθ is positive, 0.866, so the denominator becomes 3 - 6*0.866 = 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Hmm, negative under square root. That can't be.

So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that gives a positive denominator.

Wait, but then, for cubic, when θ=90°, cosθ=0, so d=a/sqrt(3), which is correct.

But here, θ=30°, so cosθ=√3/2≈0.866.

So the denominator is 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 + 5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.863≈3.494 Angstroms. But the options are all around 8-10, which is way bigger. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I have the formula inverted. Perhaps the denominator is 1/(d²) equals something.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the unit cell parameters. Wait, the a in the formula is the lattice parameter, which in this problem is the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the interplanar spacing formula for a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

(1/d²) = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) * [ 1 - cosθ (h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) ) / (h² +k² + l²) ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps someone has a better approach.

Alternate approach: Since the lattice is rhombohedral, we can model it as a unit cell with vectors a, b, c, all equal in length, and angles between each pair equal to θ=30 degrees.

So, the unit cell vectors are:

a = a_i = (a, 0, 0)

b = a_j = (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0)

c = a_k = (a cosθ, 0, a sinθ ) [Hmm, perhaps, but I'm not certain about the exact components. Alternatively, perhaps all vectors have angles of θ with each other, so each pair has the same angle.]

Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are:

a = (a, 0, 0)

b = (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0)

c = (a cosθ, 0, a sinθ )

But perhaps it's easier to use the Miller indices and the formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But when θ is 30°, this gives negative under the square root, which isn't possible. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) [ (1 - cosα cosβ cosγ) / (1 - cosα cosβ cosγ + cos²α + cos²β + cos²γ) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's more accurate. Since in our case, α=β=γ=30°, let's compute the denominator.

So, denominator D = 1 - cos30 * cos30 * cos30 + cos²30 + cos²30 + cos²30.

Wait, let's compute each term.

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So cos30^3 = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3√3)/(8) ≈0.6495.

Now, the first term: 1 - (cos^3 30) = 1 - 0.6495 ≈0.3505.

The second part: sum of cos²30, which is 3*( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )= 3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25.

So D= 0.3505 + 2.25 = 2.6005.

Now, numerator N is (h² +k² +l²) in the first part.

So for (111), h² +k² +l² = 3.

So now, for 1/d²:

1/d² = (3) * [0.3505/2.6005 ]

Compute 0.3505 /2.6005≈ 0.1348.

So 1/d² = 3 * 0.1348 ≈0.4044.

So d² =1/0.4044 ≈2.473.

Thus, d≈sqrt(2.473)≈1.572.

But again, this gives d≈1.572 Angstrom, but the options are much larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which is the lattice parameter a. So if the formula yields d=1.572, that would make sense if the options were around that, but they're much larger.

Wait, perhaps I swapped a and something else. Wait, the formula I used is for a general system, but perhaps it's scaled by the volume or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (h² +k² +l²)( (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) ) )

Wait, but no, that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: Look for the formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice.

Wait, I found a reference that says for a rhombohedral lattice with a, angles α, the interplanar distance (111) is given by:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cosα + 6 cos^2 α )

Wait, is that correct? Let me plug in the numbers.

Given a=10 Angstrom, α=30°, cos30≈0.8660.

So denominator: sqrt(3 -6*(0.8660) +6*(0.8660)^2 )

Compute each term:

-6 * 0.8660 ≈-5.196.

6*(0.8660)^2 =6*(0.75)=4.5.

So denominator: 3 -5.196 +4.5 = (3+4.5) -5.196 =7.5-5.196=2.304.

So d=10 / sqrt(2.304) ≈10 /1.518≈6.587 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 8-10. Hmm, so not matching.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cosα + 6 cos^2 α )

Wait, wait, 3 -6 cosα +6 cos²α.

So 3 -6*(0.866) +6*(0.75)=3-5.196+4.5=2.304 as before.

So d=10 / sqrt(2.304)≈10/1.518≈6.587, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, maybe the formula is different.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 - 2*(3) * cos30°.

Which is 3 - 6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. That's negative, which can't be right. So perhaps I have a wrong sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So denominator is 3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10 /2.863≈3.494 Angstrom. Still not matching options.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating.

Wait,
