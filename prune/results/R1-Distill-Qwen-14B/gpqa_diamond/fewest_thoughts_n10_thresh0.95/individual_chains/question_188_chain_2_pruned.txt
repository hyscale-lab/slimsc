Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

First, I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are calculated using the Bragg's law formula, but wait, no, Bragg's law is more about the diffraction. Oh right, for interplanar distances, the formula involves the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance 'd' in a crystal is given by d = (a)/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ))), but wait, wait—I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think it's d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Another thought: in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, but here it's rhombohedral, so all angles are the same, which is 30 degrees in this case.

Wait, wait. Rhombohedral means that all edges are equal, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, so in this question, α=β=γ=30 degrees. So the lattice is rhombohedral, which is a special case of a hexagonal crystal system? Or maybe it's a separate category. I'm a bit confused about the crystal systems, but I think rhombohedral has a = b = c and α=β=γ.

So the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha)}}}

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I remember that for a non-cubic system, the formula is more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the expression derived from the unit cell vectors. The reciprocal lattice vector is involved here, I think. Alternatively, the formula is d = 1/( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (a^2) / (something) )^(1/2) ) — no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for a rhombohedral lattice. Oh, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters are a = b = c, and the angles α=β=γ=θ (which is 30 degrees here). The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) can be determined using the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta} }

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because for a cubic system, θ is 90 degrees, so cos θ is zero, so the formula becomes d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in our case, angles are 30 degrees, so cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 \cos^2 α + (l/c)^2 \cos^2 β - 2(hk/(ab)) \cos γ - 2(hl/(ac)) \cos β - 2(kl/(bc)) \cos α } }

Wait, no, that's not correct. I think that's the formula for the Miller indices in a triclinic system. Alternatively, perhaps for the rhombohedral lattice, which is a special case, maybe the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral lattice, since a = b = c, and the angles are all theta, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the dimensions. The numerator is a length, and the denominator is sqrt( (dimensionless terms) ), so the units are correct.
