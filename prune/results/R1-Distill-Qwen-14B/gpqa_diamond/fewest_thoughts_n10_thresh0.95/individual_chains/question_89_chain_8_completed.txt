Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the 1H NMR of product 3, and the options are various splitting patterns.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. When you dehydrohalogenate such a compound with a strong base like KOH, especially under heat, it's likely an elimination reaction. So, heating with KOH would probably form an alkene via elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it forms a diene? Or maybe two separate eliminations occur, but since adamantane is a rigid structure, the elimination would form a bridge.

Wait, another possibility is that it's a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene. Alternatively, in adamantane, the structure is such that losing two HBr molecules would form an allene or a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on adjacent bridgehead positions, leading to a different structure.

Wait, wait. The product after KOH heating is a solid with an IR absorption at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a ketone group. So what would happen when a dihalide reacts with KOH to form a ketone? Oh, wait, that's the opposite of elimination. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, and the reaction is elimination, but maybe it's more than just eliminating HBr. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, another pathway: maybe the dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diketone? Wait, but that's not how elimination works. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, probably a ketone.

Wait, product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, maybe each Br is adjacent, and elimination forms a carbonyl group. But wait, elimination typically forms double bonds, not carbonyls. Oh wait, wait! Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene, but if the structure is such that two adjacent carbons have Br, elimination would form a double bond. But how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an elimination reaction. If the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. But how does that form a ketone?

Wait, perhaps it's an example of a Hofmann elimination, but that would form an amine, which doesn't fit here. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that dehydrohalogenation leads to a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but in adamantane, bridgehead double bonds are not possible due to Bredt's rule. So maybe elimination isn't the right path.

Another angle: perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH via a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, that's more likely to form a diol. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Wait, but sometimes, especially with vicinal dihalides, KOH can lead to elimination (forming an alkene) or, if the conditions are different, perhaps substitution. Hmm, but the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: if the base deprotonates a β-hydrogen, leading to a conjugate base, which then forms a carbonyl via elimination of HBr. Wait, but how would that happen in a dihalide? Maybe each Br is in a position where elimination can form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Eliminating HBr from each bridgehead could form a ketone. Let me visualize adamantane: it has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So, upon elimination, perhaps each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds or carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe each HBr elimination forms a carbonyl. So, for each elimination, you lose HBr and form a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require each Br to be adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl. Hmm, but each elimination would typically form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide, upon treatment with a strong base like KOH, undergoes a double elimination, losing two equivalents of HBr. If each elimination forms a double bond, but how would that end up with a ketone?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this incorrectly. Maybe the product is a ketone because the reaction is a double elimination leading to a conjugated dienone? But that doesn't fit the NMR description.

Wait, let's think of the NMR data for product 1. The peaks are 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe a methylene next to an electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 is a multiplet integrating to 10H, perhaps bridgehead CH2 groups or similar. The 1.94 is another 2H, perhaps a methylene group adjacent to something else.

But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a diketone? Or maybe a single ketone and some other groups.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait another idea: perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves a vicinal diol losing water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is a dihalide with KOH. Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted to a diol first, then under basic conditions, rearranges.

Wait, but the initial reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination forming a diketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but for each Br, eliminating HBr and forming a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, and removing each leads to two carbonyls. That would give a diketone.

But looking at the NMR: the integration is 2H, 10H, 2H. Wait, total is 14H. Adamantane has 12 carbons, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, so in the parent compound, each bridgehead is CH2Br? No, adamantane has bridgehead CH groups, probably. Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads. Each bridgehead in the parent structure is a CH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bridgehead CH2Br groups? Or perhaps CHBr?

Wait, no. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure with four bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead carbon is connected by three bridges, so each bridgehead has three bonds to other carbons, making them each CH groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br attached to two bridgehead CH groups, making them CHBr.

So when KOH is used, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But if the structure is such that two adjacent bridgeheads have Br, the elimination would form a double bond between them. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not possible in bridged bicyclic compounds because of the strain and poor orbital alignment.

So, if elimination isn't possible because of Bredt's rule, what else could happen? Maybe the base induces a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the Br atoms are not on the bridgeheads but on the adjacent carbons. Hmm, but the question states it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Brs are on bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps instead of elimination, this is a substitution reaction. But with KOH, which is a base, substitution is less likely unless the structure is very prone to it. But then again, we have a carbonyl in the product. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Br atoms undergo oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bond, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, if each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require an oxidation. Hmm, but that's not a typical reaction with KOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but instead of forming a double bond, the base somehow forms a carbonyl. Oh wait! Maybe it's a case where each elimination forms a carbonyl group. But how does that happen?

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the product's NMR. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm integrating to 2H. The chemical shift of 4.79 is higher than typical CH2 groups, but lower than an oxygen-bearing group. Wait, maybe that's a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or a ketone. Wait, but 4.79 is more in line with a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

But wait, product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Let's say it's an ether, but the IR has a carbonyl, which would suggest a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with some other substituents. Let's consider the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. So, if each bridgehead Br is eliminated with a β-hydrogen, the adjacent carbons form carbonyl groups. So, maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone.

Wait, but how. Let me imagine the structure. If two bridgehead Brs are removed, each via elimination, and each elimination forms a carbonyl group. So, the resulting molecule would have two ketone groups. But in adamantane, forming two ketones on adjacent bridgeheads might be possible, but would the structure allow that? Let me try to imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single ketone group. So, maybe only one HBr is eliminated, but that wouldn't explain the IR showing a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on the same bridge, leading to a conjugated dienone after elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH is used, which is a strong base, and the reaction is heated. So, it's likely an elimination. But when KOH reacts with a dihalide, it can form an epoxide if the dihalide is vicinal. Wait, but in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is not vicinal. So that might not apply.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide isn't vicinal, which means it's not adjacent. So, elimination to form an epoxide is not possible.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each losing HBr to form a double bond, but because of the structure, the two double bonds are conjugated, leading to a dienone. Wait, but that would require the formation of double bonds that can conjugate with each other. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone via some rearrangement. Wait, perhaps it's a case where the elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead carbonyl. But again, bridgehead carbonyls are possible, as they're not as restricted as bridgehead double bonds. Wait, but in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are already highly substituted.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the product after the first step. Product 1 has a carbonyl. Let me imagine that product 1 is adamantanone, but that's just a single ketone. If it's 1,3-diketone, but that would require two ketone groups.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at δ4.79 ppm for 2H. What type of group gives a singlet? Probably a CH2 group not split by neighboring hydrogens, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, but that's a single ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but the IR doesn't show an -OH stretch, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring-opened structure. Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so ring-opening is unlikely under these conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but since the structure can't form a bridgehead double bond (due to Bredt's rule), the double bond forms elsewhere. But then, why the IR would show a carbonyl? Unless it's a conjugated dienone.

Wait, perhaps eliminating two HBr molecules leads to a conjugated dienone. Let me imagine that. If the starting material has two Brs at positions that, when eliminated, form a conjugated dienone. That would have two double bonds and a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a ketone with an exocyclic double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone (since IR has a carbonyl). So, perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound? Wait, adamantane isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts doesn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If you treat a ketone with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation or some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has an enolizable hydrogen. The ketone could tautomerize to an enol, which could react with Al(OiPr)3. But I'm not sure what reaction that would lead to.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 undergoes elimination again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. So, let me think about the structure of product 3.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene. Then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3 is the question.

Wait, going back to the earlier steps: product 1 is a carbonyl compound. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to form an enolate, which could then undergo some kind of reaction.

Wait, but Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an alcohol. Wait, but the IR doesn't show an -OH stretch. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al(OiPr)3 catalyzes ring-opening. But then product 2 would have an alcohol or other functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze some ester condensation.

I think I'm getting stuck on the first step. Perhaps I should try to figure out what product 1 is.

Product 1's IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O). The NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe an ether, but more likely adjacent to a carbonyl.

The singlet suggests that these two protons are not split by neighboring Hs, so maybe they're in a symmetrical environment, like a CH2 group flanked by two similar groups, perhaps in a ketone environment.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. If the structure is such that two ketone groups are present, the NMR would show signals for the carbonyl-adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I can think about the entire reaction sequence.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH, heat → product 1 (carbonyl)

product 1 → Al(OiPr)3, heat → product 2 (which has a double bond, as ozonolysis is used on it)

product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond in product 2 was.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyl groups and perhaps some other structures.

But let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by a reaction catalyzed by Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 forms an enol ether, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon heating with Al(OiPr)3 (a strong Lewis acid) undergoes elimination to form a diene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of the diene would produce two carbonyls.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me retrace.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH, heat → product 1, which is a diol.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product would have a ketone. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo a substitution reaction to form a diol (1,3-diol). But with KOH being a base, substitution is less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about product 1 again.

If product 1 has a carbonyl, and the NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79, perhaps it's a methylene group next to a carbonyl. So, maybe a structure like (CH2)2CO. But in adamantane's context, that might be a bridgehead CH2CO group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridgehead ketone. For example, if each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that's not substitution. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated dienone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring opened to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond, and product 1 is an alkene. But then, the IR would show a C=C stretch, not a C=O.

But the IR is at 1720, which is definitely a carbonyl. So, product 1 must have a C=O group.

Another thought: Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a reaction with KOH to form a diketone via two successive eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. But how? Elimination typically forms double bonds, not carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps each elimination is a conjugate elimination. Wait, for example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, eliminating HBr from each could form a bridgehead carbonyl. But bridgehead carbonyls are possible.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each elimination would form a carbonyl group on each bridgehead. But that would require the Brs to be in positions that allow such eliminations without violating Bredt's rule.

Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a ketone group, leading to a 1,3-diketone.

But then, product 1's NMR would have peaks corresponding to CH2 groups adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows 2H at 4.79 as a singlet. So maybe each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, and due to symmetry, they're equivalent, giving a singlet.

So, product 1 would be a 1,3-diketone. Then, the NMR would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones as a singlet, and the rest of the hydrogens in the adamantane structure.

So, moving on. Product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

Product 1 is then heated with excess Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid. This could induce a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to form an enolate, which could undergo a reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Al(OiPr)3 can catalyze the formation of enol ethers from ketones. Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the Lewis acid facilitates the formation of an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes an elimination in the presence of Al(OiPr)3 to form a double bond. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1, which is a diketone. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would typically be next to electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyls.

In the 1H NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that. For example, if product 3 is a diketone or has carbonyl groups, the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded.

But wait, ozonolysis of a diene typically gives carbonyl groups at each end. So, if product 2 was a diene, say, a 1,4-diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, possibly producing two aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but the exact structure depends on where the double bonds are. Let me imagine product 2 is a diene, say, 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, but in a cyclic structure, it might form cyclic diketones.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, perhaps as aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Let's think: product 2's structure is such that ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups, and in the NMR, the most deshielded proton would be next to one of these carbonyls.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens. For example, if a hydrogen is adjacent to another set of hydrogens, it will split into a certain pattern.

In the case of a carbonyl group, the adjacent CH2 group would have protons that couple with each other and perhaps with other neighboring groups.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)nCO. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring groups.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, say, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would have protons that split based on their neighboring groups.

But in this case, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between two ketone groups. The protons on that CH2 would be split by adjacent CH groups or other protons.

Wait, but the exact structure is hard to determine without knowing product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and possibly some other substituents.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be in the most electron-deficient environment, like next to a carbonyl.

Assuming product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, the coupling would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each proton on CH2 would be coupling with two protons on the same CH2 (which would be a triplet if they're equivalent) and perhaps with other groups.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the CH group is adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a singlet if no neighbors, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Which of these would arise from a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group.

Let me imagine that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2, which itself is next to another group. So, for example, the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-X, where X is another group.

In this case, the protons on the first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would couple with the adjacent CH2 (maybe a triplet). But wait, each proton in the first CH2 would couple with two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent CH2 is split into a triplet by another group, it would propagate. Alternatively, perhaps each proton in the first CH2 is coupled with two protons on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, and also coupled with another set of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the splitting could be different.

Wait, another scenario: the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each H would have coupling with two adjacent Hs on one side and perhaps two on the other. That could lead to a triplet of triplets or a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group that's split into a doublet, the coupling would be a triplet.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is a diene (if product 1 is a diketone that upon reaction with Al(OiPr)3 forms a diene). Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls.

Wait, if product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, perhaps. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene gives two aldehydes and a ketone? No, wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene typically gives two carbonyl compounds. For example, 1,3-butadiene would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a cyclic structure, it might give a cyclic diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, and ozonolysis would break it into a diketone. For example, if product 2 is cyclopentadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a mono-alkene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

In that case, product 3 would have a carbonyl group and adjacent CH2 groups.

The most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Assuming that, let's say the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded.

Each CH2 would have adjacent CH2 groups. So, the first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would have two protons, each coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would split each into a triplet.

Wait, but each H on the first CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet. But since the two Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

So, if the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2, its coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, perhaps there are more coupling partners.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH(CH2X)-Y. Then, the CH group would have coupling with the adjacent CH2 group's two Hs and perhaps another group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the initial product 1's NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79. If product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the singlet comes from a CH2 group flanked by two carbonyls. Then, upon reaction with Al(OiPr)3, product 2 could form an enol ether, which would have a double bond. Ozonolysis of that double bond would break it into two carbonyls, making product 3.

In product 3, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have Hs that are now split due to adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to two carbonyls. That CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling with adjacent Hs.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyls. The Hs on this CH2 would couple with each other (giving a triplet), but since they're equivalent, the splitting would still be a triplet.

But wait, if there are other nearby Hs, like from another CH2 group, the triplet could be split further.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the CH2 is coupling with two Hs on adjacent groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs. For a triplet, each H must be coupled with two Hs on adjacent carbons. If each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, it could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a position where it's coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, maybe I should consider that product 3 is a diketone, with two ketone groups. Between them is a CH2 group. The Hs on this CH2 would be deshielded and adjacent to two carbonyls. Each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet), and possibly with Hs from adjacent CH2 groups.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls and connected to another CH2 group, then each H on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs from the same CH2 (triplet), and perhaps with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is only coupled with one set of two Hs, it would be a triplet.

But given the options, and considering the possibility of multiple coupling partners, I think the correct answer is a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might be a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with three Hs, leading to a quartet, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and two CH2 groups. So, each H would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to (n+1)(m+1) splitting, where n and m are the number of Hs on each adjacent group. So, each adjacent group has two Hs, leading to (2+1)(2+1)=9 peaks, which would be a nonet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent CH2 and one H from another adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the splitting based on product 3's structure.

If product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 would have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each neighboring CH2 group. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Each H on the middle CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would see four neighboring Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs on the same carbon or the next.

Wait, perhaps each H on the middle CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (which would be a triplet due to the two Hs), and also coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). But when you have coupling with two different sets, the splitting combines multiplicatively.

So, the first coupling (with two Hs) would split into a triplet, and the second coupling (another two Hs) would split each of those peaks into triplets again, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the most deshielded H would have a triplet of triplet splitting pattern.

So, the answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, which forms product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group, such as a carbonyl. The remaining signals (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) correspond to hydrogens in the adamantane framework.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves the formation of a double bond, as product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step. Ozonolysis at -78°C cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, which is highly electron-withdrawing.

In the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen depends on its neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to two carbonyls, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (forming a triplet) and with the two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (also forming a triplet). The combination of these couplings results in a triplet of triplets.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
