Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, also known as SMEFT. Hmm, I've heard a bit about this but I'm not super confident. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The options given are combinations of these.

Wait, wait, first I need to recall what each of these symmetries means and which ones are fundamental in the Standard Model.

I remember that Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames of reference. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (so it's like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime). But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz? So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So maybe the operators are required to respect certain symmetries, and some are more fundamental than others.

In SMEFT, we usually extend the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized in a way that respects the underlying symmetries of the SM, right? Because if SMEFT is an effective theory, it's supposed to reproduce the SM at lower energies. So the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

What about the SM symmetries? The Standard Model has gauge symmetry, but the question is about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT.

The SM is Lorentz invariant, so any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't be Lorentz invariant anymore, which is a big deal since that's a fundamental symmetry of relativity.

Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. But the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I'm not sure if it's required to respect Poincare. Wait, the SM itself is Poincare invariant. So perhaps the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. Or maybe SMEFT doesn't require translation symmetry because it's an effective theory? Hmm, not sure. I think that since the SM respects Poincare, the SMEFT must too because it's an extension.

CP symmetry is another thing. The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some of its theories (like the electroweak) do. Wait, no, the SM has certain CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry. Therefore, operators in SMEFT might not have to respect CP. But wait, the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators." So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to either, right? Because the operators could include terms that violate CP, depending on the new physics.

But wait, no. The SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built by adding terms that are compatible with the SM's symmetries. So the operators are constructed by taking products of SM fields in a way that's invariant under the SM's gauge and other symmetries. But other symmetries? For example, the SM doesn't require CP symmetry, so the operators can break CP as well. So operators in SMEFT might not need to respect CP. Hence, option 3 (CP symmetry) may not be a must.

CPT symmetry is a big one. The CPT theorem says that in a quantum field theory, the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal must be a symmetry. But wait, in the SM, CPT is respected. So any effective theory like SMEFT should also respect CPT. Because if you violate CPT, you have much bigger issues, like non-unitarity and all that. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be respected.

Putting it all together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes.
2. Poincare symmetry: Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. But wait, Poincare includes translations which are about momentum. SMEFT is an effective theory, so maybe it's not required. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe SMEFT doesn't require Poincare because it's a low-energy theory and the symmetries are broken by the cutoff. Wait, no, because the effective theory is supposed to be valid up to some scale, and it should still respect the symmetries of the underlying theory (the SM), which includes Poincare. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected.

Wait, but the question lists option 2 as Poincare symmetry. So do the operators have to respect that? Or is Lorentz symmetry enough? Because if Poincare includes Lorentz, then all operators must respect both? Or is it that respecting Poincare implies Lorentz. So the question is whether Poincare is a symmetry that SMEFT operators must respect.

Alternatively, I remember that the SMEFT is built by considering operators that are invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. So maybe the operators are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare includes translation symmetry, which in an effective theory might be broken by the presence of a cutoff scale. But wait, the effective theory is supposed to be Lorentz invariant, so I think that Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if Lorentz and translation are. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, another angle: Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant. So in SMEFT, which is an effective theory that reduces to the SM at low energies, the operators should respect Poincare symmetry. Because the SM respects it, the SMEFT must as well. So operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2).

So options 1 and 2 are musts.

But wait, no. Because translation symmetry is part of Poincare. In an effective theory, you can have an effective Lagrangian that includes operators of different dimensions, but translation symmetry would imply that the equations of motion are the same everywhere, which is probably true. So it's probably necessary for all operators to respect Poincare symmetry.

So 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these are absolute, regardless of the underlying model?

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the SMEFT Lagrangian. The SMEFT is constructed by adding operators that are invariant under the SM gauge symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must be Lorentz invariant, which makes sense. But what about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations. But the SMEFT is a quantum field theory, so the operators would have to be translation-invariant as well. Wait, but operators like higher-dimensional terms (e.g., dimension 6) would include terms like (∂μ ϕ)^2, but that's already part of the SM. Alternatively, maybe translation invariance is automatically respected because the operators are local, so the theory respects Poincare.

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT doesn't require Poincare symmetry beyond Lorentz because it's an effective theory, but that's a bit unclear.

Another approach: look at the options. The options are combinations. So the options given are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

If both 1 and 2 must be respected, then options A, C, or any that include 1 and 2. But what about 3 and 4?

CP symmetry: as the SM doesn't respect it, SMEFT operators don't have to either. So 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry: the SM respects it, so SMEFT must as well. So 4 is a must.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but do SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translation, which in an effective theory might not be a symmetry. But wait, the effective theory is built in a way that the operators are local, so translation symmetry is still there. Because the operators are written as local terms in the Lagrangian density. So the total Lagrangian is translation invariant.

So yes, Poincare symmetry must be respected. So operators must respect 1, 2, and 4.

So, looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's answer C.

But wait, earlier I thought about 1 and 2. So the correct answer would have 1,2,4. So option C.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up things. Let's double-check.

Lorentz symmetry is a must. CPT is a must. Poincare is a must as well.

But wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So if the question is about which must be respected, and the options are 1 and 2, it's possible that Poincare (2) is a subset that includes Lorentz (1). But the question is phrased as which must be respected. So if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is automatically required. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect all of 1,2,4.

So looking at the options, that would be option C.

Wait, but what about option C: 1,2,4. So including Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

So let me think again. Since the SM respects Poincare, so must SMEFT. So operators must respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz as part of it.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) at low energies. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Here's the analysis:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** The SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT, being an effective theory extending the SM, must respect Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it. This implies that operators in SMEFT are translation-invariant and respect the full Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** The SM does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and the SM respects it. As SMEFT is an effective theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is the option that includes these three symmetries.

**Answer: C**
