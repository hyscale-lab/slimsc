Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the operator A_y (Ay) is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. So that would make Ay a 2x2 matrix as well. The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and figure out which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Since Ay is 2x2, this should be manageable.

First, let's write down Ay. Let's compute it:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). Let me compute each element:

Top-left element: 0 * c = 0.
Top-right: (-i) * c = (-i)(h/(4π))
Bottom-left: i * c = i*(h/(4π))
Bottom-right: 0 * c = 0.

So Ay looks like this:

Ay = [ [0, (-i)(h/(4π)) ],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ] where c = h/(4π). 

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The determinant of (Ay - λ I) is zero.

So the matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[ -λ,          (-i c)       ]
[ i c,         -λ          ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i c)(-i c) = λ² - (i c)(-i c).

Wait, let's compute the product (i c)(-i c):

i * (-i) = -i² = -( (-1) ) = 1. So (i c)(-i c) = (i)(-i) c² = (1) c².

So determinant equation becomes:

λ² - (c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, since c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary part are ±2π h, which seems way off. Option B talks about .5 and 1, which doesn't match. Option C is about eigenfunctions. Option D says the eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay.

Wait, but wait, the matrix S is a Pauli matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices
