Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars, let's call it N, is proportional to 1 divided by parallax (plx) raised to the fifth power. Mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to relate this to distance, not parallax. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is equal to d. Let me write that down:

plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx.

Now, since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting d in terms of plx, we get N ∝ d^5. Wait, wait, let me see: 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, but I think I need to be careful here.

Wait no, actually, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since 1/plx is d, then N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in distance d, how does N change? I think I need to find the rate of change of N with respect to d.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the distribution of stars. Let me think: The number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr is proportional to 4πr² dr multiplied by the density. But the density here is given by 1/plx^5, but since plx is 1/d, which is 1/r here, then 1/plx^5 = r^5.

Wait wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's try to model it. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r and thickness dr is given by the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness dr, multiplied by the number density of stars (n). So N(r) dr = 4π r² dr * n.

But the problem states that N (the number of stars) varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx^5 = r^5. So the number density n would be proportional to r^5.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. But that's when considering the total number up to a certain distance. Alternatively, perhaps the number per unit volume is r^5.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how many stars are there per unit distance. Let me try to model it more carefully.

The number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by the number of stars per unit area. If the number per unit area (N) varies as 1/plx^5, then since plx = 1/r, N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in the shell would be N(r) * 4π r² dr, where N(r) is the number per unit area.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if N (per unit area) is r^5, then the number in the shell would be 4π r² * r^5 dr = 4π r^7 dr. That seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So let's think about how many stars are there at a given distance r. The number of stars per unit area at distance r could be proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So the number of stars in a ring (annulus) at radius r with thickness dr would be the area of the ring (2π r dr) times the number per unit area.

Wait, wait, no, the area is 2π r dr for a ring. So number of stars in the ring would be (number per unit area) * (area). If number per unit area is proportional to r^5, then number of stars is proportional to r^5 * 2π r dr = 2π r^6 dr.

But that would give the number of stars as a function of r. So the number of stars per unit distance (the radial density) is proportional to r^6. Hmm, but the options don't have an r^6 option. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is asking about how the number of stars increases with distance, and how the rate changes. So if the number of stars N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx =1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the total number up to distance r is proportional to r^5. But the question is about the change per unit distance. That would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, let's model N as a function of r. So N(r) = k * r^5, where k is a constant. Then the rate of change of N with r is dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4 per unit distance. Hmm, that would make the correct answer option C, which is proportional to r^4. But let's double-check.

Wait, wait, another approach. The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in a region up to distance r is N(r) = A r^5, where A is a constant. The change in number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r, which is 5A r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the number of stars is considered per unit volume. Wait, no, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax is in inverse parsecs, so plx in [pc^{-1}]. So 1/plx^5 would be [pc^5], which is distance^5, since distance is in parsecs. So N is proportional to r^5. But why does the change per unit distance matter?

If N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr =5 r^4. So the correct option is C, which is r^4.

But wait, the options are presented as per unit range of distance. So per unit r, the number of stars increases as r^4.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be option C, ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the relation, \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the total number of stars up to a distance \( r \) increases as \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes per unit distance, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). If \( N(r) \propto r^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
