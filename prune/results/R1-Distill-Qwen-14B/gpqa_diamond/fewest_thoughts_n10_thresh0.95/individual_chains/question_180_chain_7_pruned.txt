Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has charge 2e, which is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from point P, which has the 13th charge.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy... Oh, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since like charges repel, the system will have potential energy due to their mutual repulsion.

Wait, but how do I calculate the potential energy here? I remember the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (about 8.988e9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, in this case, we have multiple charges. So I need to calculate the potential energy contributed by each pair of charges. But wait, considering that each of the 12 charges at 2m is interacting with the other 11, and also each interacts with the fixed charge at P.

Wait, no, hold on. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges at 2m is interacting with this fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, so each of them is 2m away from P.

But wait, the 12 charges are at 2m from P. So their positions are all 2m away, but are they arranged in a way that they are equally distant from each other? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which suggests they're on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But the exact arrangement isn't specified, but since all are at the same distance from P, perhaps we can model this as each of the 12 charges being a distance 2m from P, and the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their positions on the sphere. But wait, the problem says each of the 12 is 2m from P, but doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. Hmm, that complicates things because if I don't know the exact distance between each pair, it's hard to calculate the potential energy between them.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the interaction of each of the 12 charges with the fixed charge at P, and not with each other. Because if that's the case, the problem simplifies a lot. Let me think. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Does the system's energy include all the interactions, including between the 12? Because if those charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified, perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy due to each of the 12 charges and the fixed one. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that they are all at the same point, but that can't be since they're fixed at 2m from P. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point 2m away from P. But that would cause a problem because like charges can't be brought together without work, which would require considering their mutual repulsion. But maybe the problem is considering only the potential due to each charge with the fixed one, not between themselves. But that seems unlikely because the system's total potential energy would include all interactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the problem.

"12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P."

Ah, perhaps the 12 charges are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m centered at P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement. So the mutual distances vary. But for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the only interaction we need to consider is between each of the 12 and the fixed charge at P. Because calculating the mutual potential between the 12 would require knowing their arrangement, which isn't given. So perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th fixed charge, ignoring the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. That would make the problem solvable.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. If we're trying to minimize the energy, perhaps bringing all the 12 charges as close as possible to each other would minimize their mutual potential energy, but since they're constrained to stay 2m from P, but no constraint on their mutual positions, perhaps the minimum occurs when all 12 are as close as possible together, which would be at the same point 2m from P. But that's impossible because you can't have 12 identical positive charges at the same point without infinite repulsion; but in the problem, their positions are already fixed at 2m from P, which suggests their arrangement is fixed. So perhaps the problem does not require considering their mutual interactions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that's symmetric, like equally spaced on a sphere. But without knowing their exact positions, we can't compute their mutual potential energies.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. Each has charge 2e, and the fixed charge is 2e as well. So each pair (fixed charge and a moving charge) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, but wait. The fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each interaction is between two 2e charges, at 2 meters apart.

So the potential energy for one pair is U = (k)*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Let me compute that.

But wait, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k*(q1*q2)/r. So substituting:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²
each charge q = 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C
r = 2 meters.

So U for one pair is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let me calculate that step by step.

First, (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = Let's see: 8.988 * 10.24 ≈ 92.09, so 92.09e-29.

Wait, 8.
