Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from two points on Earth's orbit, right? And the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But wait, I need to relate this to distance. Since plx is 1/distance (d), I can express plx as 1/d. So plx = 1/d, which means 1/plx is d. So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But wait, I should think about the number per unit distance. Because the question says "per unit range of distance, r."

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance d (plx = 1/d), substituting gives N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range). Oh, perhaps it's about the differential number of stars with distance. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be proportional to d^4 times dr, right?

Wait, let me think. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/d, that's N ∝ d^5. But when you're considering the number of stars per unit distance, you should think about how many stars are there per parsec (or per unit distance). So maybe it's the differential number. Like, if you have a small change in distance dr, how does the number of stars change in that interval.

Wait, maybe I should model it as a function of distance. Suppose the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is a certain function. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question might be implying that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d and thickness dr is proportional to something. Let me try a different approach.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius d and thickness dr would depend on the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dr. So if the number of stars in such a shell is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit volume (or per unit shell thickness) would be N_shell = k d^5 / (4π d² dr) )? Wait, no, maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The number of stars in a shell is the surface density times the area, times the thickness. Or wait, if the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. But N is the number of stars in a volume. Wait, maybe the number of stars in a volume element (like a small cube) is proportional to d^5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step by step.

Given: Number of stars (N) varies with parallax as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx = 1/d, so replacing plx with 1/d, we have N ∝ d^5.

So N = k d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit distance. So perhaps it's the derivative of N with respect to d. Because the change in N per unit change in d would tell us the rate at which the number of stars increases (or decreases) with distance.

So dN/dd = 5k d^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. So the number of stars in a unit distance interval (like per parsec) would be proportional to d^4.

But wait, the original N is the total number of stars. So if N increases as d^5, the number of stars per unit volume (like per cubic parsec) would be N / (4π/3 d² dr) for a shell, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dr, which is the volume of the shell (4π d² dr) multiplied by some surface density. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: if the number of stars in a region is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance is dN/dr. So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be 5 d^4. So per unit distance, the number increases as r^4.

So looking at the options, option C is r^4, which would correspond to that.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the units. Parallax is in arcseconds, which is 1/d (d in parsec). So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, then substituting plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. But when you think about the number of stars per unit distance (like in a slice dr), you take the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 d^4.

So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the change in the number of stars as you move a unit distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a range dr is proportional to d^5 * dr, but the number per unit dr is d^5, which would be option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try again. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Parallax plx is 1/d. So 1/plx = d. Then 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in a region is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So per unit distance, how does N change? That would be dN/dr.

Since N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So per unit change in r, the change in N is proportional to r^4.

So the number of stars in a unit distance interval increases as r^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), where \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes per unit distance, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). If \( N \propto d^5 \), then \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval (\( \Delta d \)) increases as \( d^4 \).

Among the options provided, the one that matches this behavior is \( \sim r^4 \), where \( r \) represents distance. Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
