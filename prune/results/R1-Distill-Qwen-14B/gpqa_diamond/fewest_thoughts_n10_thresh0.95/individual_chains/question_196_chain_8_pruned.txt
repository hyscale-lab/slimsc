Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed would be when KE is (1/2)kA². Using KE = (1/2)mv², setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)m v². Solving for v gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So let's model this. The oscillator has potential energy U = (1/2)k x². At maximum amplitude, x = A, so U = (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the total energy comes from the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't the same as in classical mechanics.

Wait, the system's total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 k A²) at maximum amplitude. Because at maximum amplitude, the speed is zero, so all the energy is potential. Then, when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), its speed is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, no. Or is it? Wait, in the relativistic case, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But the kinetic energy is not the classical (1/2 mv²) but the relativistic form, which is (gamma -1) mc².

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, wait: in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A² at maximum displacement. So when the mass is at x=A, the speed is zero, so the total energy is purely potential and rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, in the classical case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². But in relativity, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)k A², and the rest energy is mc². So the total energy would be mc² + (1/2)k A².

When the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is the kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the potential energy is (1/2)k A² at x=A, then when the mass is at x=0, all that potential energy plus the rest energy would contribute to kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing concepts here.

Alternatively, maybe the total energy is considered as the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Then, at the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is E, which is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, let me think again. The total mechanical energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². When the mass is moving, at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is E. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = E.

So:

(gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because on the left side we have (gamma-1)mc² = E, which is mc² + (1/2)k A². So:

(gamma - 1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma - 1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, that would imply gamma = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But gamma is supposed to be greater than 1, and when the mass is moving, the speed is a significant fraction of c, so gamma is larger.

Wait, but let me re-examine. Maybe the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)k A², which is correct. So the total energy is mc² + (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point, kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So:

(gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, so gamma -1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), which would make gamma= 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) again. That seems off because (k A²)/(2 m c²) could be larger than 1, making gamma greater than 2. But let's proceed.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c²) as some variable to simplify. Let me let (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = alpha.

Then,

gamma = 2 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 2 + alpha.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(2 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (2 + alpha)^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (2 + alpha)^2 )

= [ (2 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / ( (2 + alpha)^2 )

= [4 +4 alpha + alpha² -1 ] / ( (2 + alpha)^2 )

= [3 +4 alpha + alpha² ] / ( (2 + alpha)^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [3 +4 alpha + alpha² ] / ( (2 + alpha)^2 ) )

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me see if I can simplify the numerator. Wait, 3 +4 alpha + alpha² = (alpha +1)(alpha +3) ? Let me check: (alpha +1)(alpha +3) = alpha² +4 alpha +3. Yes, exactly.

So,

v = c * sqrt( ( (alpha +1)(alpha +3) ) / ( (2 + alpha)^2 ) )

Hmm, maybe I can factor it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.

Wait, I've got:

v = c * sqrt( [ ( (2 + alpha)^2 -1 ) ] / ( (2 + alpha)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( ( (2 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) ) / (2 + alpha) )

= c * sqrt( ( (2 + alpha)^2 - 1 )) / (2 + alpha) )

Hmm, maybe expand the numerator:

(2 + alpha)^2 -1 = (4 + 4 alpha + alpha² ) -1 = 3 +4 alpha + alpha².

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the energy equation. Because in the relativistic case, the total energy should be gamma mc^2, right? So when the mass is at maximum displacement, x=A, velocity is zero, so the total energy is just the rest energy plus the potential energy. Or wait, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy, which in relativity might be treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator is considered as (1/2)k x², and the total energy is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy. So,

E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, so:

E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + alpha/2, where alpha is (k A^2)/(m c²).

Wait, earlier I let alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²), but perhaps I should re-express that.

Let me let alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

gamma = (1 + alpha).

So,

gamma = (1 + alpha).

So,

gamma = (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)).

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator.

Wait, alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is small if k A^2/(2 m c²) is small, but in this problem, it's possible that it's not negligible.

Wait, let me substitute alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2 = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )² ]

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) ) ]

= (k A²/(2 m c^2)) * (2 + alpha)

Denominator: [1 + alpha]^2.

So, the entire expression is:

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(2 m c^2)) * (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so substituting back:

= c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this.

Let me write it as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe the numerator is alpha (2 + alpha ) = alpha (alpha + 2 ) = alpha (alpha + 2 ), and the denominator is (alpha +1)^2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using conservation of energy.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So, E = mc² + (1/2)k x².

At the point of maximum displacement, x = A, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

When the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = E.

So,

(gamma -1 ) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma -1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Ah, so gamma = 2 + alpha, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 2 + alpha.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 2 + alpha.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(2 + alpha).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(2 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(2 + alpha)^2.

= [ (2 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (2 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(2 + alpha)^2 = 4 +4 alpha + alpha².

So numerator becomes 4 +4 alpha + alpha² - 1 = 3 +4 alpha + alpha².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (3 +4 alpha + alpha²) / ( (2 + alpha)^2 )

Factor numerator: Let's see, 3 +4 alpha + alpha².

Hmm, perhaps it's (alpha + a)(alpha + b). Let's see:

Looking for a and b such that a + b =4 and a*b=3.

So,
