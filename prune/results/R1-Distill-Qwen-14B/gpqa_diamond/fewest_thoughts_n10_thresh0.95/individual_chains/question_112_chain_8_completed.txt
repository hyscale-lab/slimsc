Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, the state is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states for the z-projection. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 -i) for |down>. But wait, it's proportional, so maybe I need to normalize it first.

Then, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix is A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure of matrix A.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Wait, no, wait. Because the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So yeah, that's the structure.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S_z has eigenstates |up> and |down>, and its matrix is diagonal. But the matrix given here isn't diagonal, so it's probably another operator, perhaps S_x or S_y, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different operator altogether.

Wait, the problem says that the operator's eigenstates are the ones we're considering. So perhaps the operator is proportional to the Pauli X or Y matrix, because those have eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

But regardless, the problem is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator A, given the state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The operator A is given, and we need to find the probabilities of the eigenstates. Oh, right, so when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state vector.

So, the first step is to find the eigenstates of the matrix A. Once I have those eigenstates, I can express |alpha> in terms of them and find the probabilities.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is diagonal in a different basis, so the eigenstates are not |up> and |down>, but some other states. So, to find the probability, I need to project |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Hmm, let me think. So first, I need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the operator A.

The matrix A is 2x2, with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let's write it as:

A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Wait, because A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0.

The eigenvalues of A can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So, the characteristic equation is:

| -λ        ħ/2       |
| ħ/2      -λ       | = 0

Which simplifies to λ² - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) = 0 → λ² = (ħ²/4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0 → [ [ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ] v = 0.

The equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). Normalized, that would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but since the matrix is real, the eigenvectors might be in the computational basis. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> perhaps, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2).

So in this case, the matrix A is (ħ/2) X, because X has 1s in the off-diagonal. So the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(±1) which are ± ħ/2, which matches what I found earlier.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)

|−x> = (|up> − |down>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the computational basis, |up> is |0> and |down> is |1>, right? So |+x> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, |−x> is (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2) = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but our state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, we'll need to express |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

So the first step is to normalize |alpha>.

The given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

So let's compute the norm: |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Hmm. Now, we need to express this state in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates of A.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the square of | < +x | alpha > |, and similarly for −ħ/2.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( ( <up| + <down| ) ) / sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7) )

Simplify this expression:

= [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2-i) <down|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

But <up|up> = <down|down> =1, and <up|down>=<down|up>=0.

So that simplifies to:

= [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

= [ (1 + i + 2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)

= (3) / sqrt(14)

Wait, because (1 + i) + (2 -i) = 3. Oh, because the imaginary parts cancel.

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), and the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14.

Similarly, let's compute < -x | alpha >.

< -x | is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So:

< -x | alpha > = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7) )

= [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Again, cross terms are zero, so:

= [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (1 +i ) -2 + i ] / sqrt(14)

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), but the probability is the squared magnitude:

( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, 9+5=14, that sums to 1, so that makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429, and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 and 5/14. But wait, let me check the exact fractions.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.35714, which is about 0.36. So option A's first two numbers match. But wait, the options also have the average value of the operator.

Wait, the operator's average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, perhaps I should compute that too.

Let me compute <A>. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, I can compute <A> as |alpha>† A |alpha>.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, the expectation value would be the sum of eigenvalue multiplied by probability.

So, the average value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= [ (9 -5) / (14*2) ] ħ = (4/(28)) ħ = (1/7) ħ.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. So option A's average matches.

But let me check the other options. Option D, for example, says average is 2ħ/sqrt(7), which is about 2*1.732/2.645 ≈ something else. Let me compute the numbers.

Wait, ħ/7 is approximately 0.1428 ħ. Option A's average is ħ/7.

So, according to this, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, and average is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A matches this.

But wait, let me double-check the probabilities. Let me recount.

Wait, when I computed < +x | alpha >, I got 3/sqrt(14), which gives probability 9/14.

Yes, that is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, matching option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and finding the average value of \( A \), given the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation with zeros on the diagonal and \( \hbar/2 \) on the off-diagonal, i.e., 

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \hbar/2 \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of \( A \)
The probability of measuring the eigenstate \( |+x\rangle \) is \( |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is \( |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \). These are calculated as follows:

1. Compute \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
|\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. Compute \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
|\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = |\alpha\rangle^\dagger A |\alpha\rangle \). Since \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \hbar/2 \) with probabilities \( 9/14 \) and \( 5/14 \), the average value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These match the values in **Option A**.
