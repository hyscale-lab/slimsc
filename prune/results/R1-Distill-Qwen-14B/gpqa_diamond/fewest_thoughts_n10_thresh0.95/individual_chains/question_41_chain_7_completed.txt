Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. Let's break it down.

The question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer. Wait, no, wait—actually, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well? Or is the glass moving towards the observer, making the beam's direction relative?

Wait, normally, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium is given by c/n, where c is the vacuum speed and n is the refractive index. But when the medium is moving relative to the observer, how does that affect the observed speed of light? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, velocities don't just add like in the Newtonian way because of relativity.

Wait, but this is a tricky point. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, according to Einstein's postulate. So wait, if the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass, then relative to the lab frame, the light's speed should still be c. But wait, no, because in the glass, the light's speed is v = c/n. So perhaps the problem is considering the glass's motion affecting the speed of light in it.

Wait, perhaps this is a scenario where the glass is moving, and the light's speed is measured relative to the lab. So I need to consider the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I have to perform a Lorentz transformation.

Right, because velocities don't just add up in classical mechanics when dealing with high speeds—especially when the speed of light is involved. So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at u' = c/n in the glass's frame.

So using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). Wait, I should recall it correctly. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

So in this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass, which is c/n. So substituting u' = c/n, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. But wait, the direction of v matters. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass (i.e., towards the observer), then in the lab frame, the beam is moving faster than the glass.

Wait, but the beam is inside the glass. So in the glass's frame, the beam is moving at c/n. Then, when the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, the lab would observe the beam's speed as u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

Substituting u' = c/n, so u = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c v)/(n c²)).

Simplify the denominator: 1 + v/(n c).

So the expression becomes (c + n v)/(n (1 + v/(n c))) )

Hmm, wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait, (c/n + v) is the numerator. The denominator is 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c².

Which is 1 + (v c)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c).

So putting it all together,

u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate the fractions:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * c.

Denominator becomes (n c) [1] + v.

So,

u = [c (c + n v)] / [n c + v]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute that step by step.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express everything in terms of c=1. Oh, right! The problem says to take c=1. So c is 1.

So substituting c=1, u' = 1/n.

So the formula becomes u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Since u' = 1/n, it's:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )

Let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v) / n

Denominator: (n + v) / n

So when you divide them, the n cancels out:

(1 + n v) / (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's the answer?

But wait, I thought that the speed of light in the lab frame must be 1, since nothing can go faster than c. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving, and the light is in the glass. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light in glass is c/n, then when you transform, the observed speed would be ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (c v)/(n c^2) ), but since c=1, it's (1/n +v)/(1 + v/(n) )

Which as I did earlier, when you compute, gives (1 +n v)/(n +v)

Wait, but if I plug in v=0, then u should be 1/n, which is correct. But if the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, so in the lab frame, the speed of light is (1 +n v)/(n +v). But wait, when n=1, the glass is vacuum, but we know that speed would be (1 +v)/(1 +v) = 1, which is correct. That makes sense.

But wait, another way to think about it: the speed of light in the lab frame is always c. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because according to Einstein's theory, no matter how fast the source is moving, light's speed is c. So why is the calculation giving a different answer?

Wait a minute, maybe the problem is assuming that the light's speed inside the moving glass is being asked. But according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the glass is moving, the speed of light in the glass (as observed in the lab) should still be c, not c/n. But wait, that's conflicting with what I calculated earlier.

So maybe the confusion arises from considering the medium's motion. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass moves, the light's speed in the lab frame should still be c, because of the speed limit.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the refractive index depends on the medium's motion. Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is such that the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. So the speed of light relative to the lab would be different.

But wait, perhaps I should think carefully about whether the velocity addition formula applies here. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So when the glass moves at v relative to the lab, the lab measures the speed as (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c²)).

But if c=1, as the question states, then it becomes (1/(n) + v)/(1 + v/(n)).

Which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v) when multiplied by n/n.

So according to that, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

But wait, wait. From the perspective of the lab frame, the speed of light can't exceed c, which is 1. Let's test the case when v is very small compared to 1/n. So if v is much smaller than 1/n, then the numerator is approximately 1/n + v, denominator is 1 + v/(n). So when you write it as (1 +n v)/(n +v), when v is small, it's approximately 1/(n) + v/(n) which is (1 +n v)/(n (1 + v/(n)) ) ) → (1 +n v)/(n (1 + ε)) ≈ (1 +n v)/(n) (1 - ε) ) where ε = v/(n). Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, think of if v is zero. Then the speed is 1/n, which is correct. If v is, say, 1/(2n), then the speed would be [1 + n*(1/(2n)) ] / [n + (1/(2n)) ] → (1 + 0.5 ) / (n + 1/(2n) ) → 1.5 / (n + 1/(2n) )

But if n=1, and v=0.5, then the speed would be (1 +1*0.5)/(1 +0.5 )= 1.5/1.5 =1, which is correct, because the light should always be c.

Wait, that makes sense. So for n=1, the formula gives 1. Let's test another case. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5.

Then the formula gives (1 + 2*0.5 )/(2 + 0.5 ) = (2)/(2.5 )= 0.8. But wait, c is 1, so that would imply that the speed of light is 0.8, which is less than c. That seems acceptable because when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is still less than c.

But wait, the question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Hmm, no, the question says 'the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory'. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me check the question again.

Question: What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?

Wait, so the 'speed of light in glass' as observed in the lab. But in relativity, the speed of light is always c=1 in any inertial frame. So why is the calculation giving a different answer? Or perhaps the question is asking about the speed of the light as measured by the lab, which should be c, but the calculation suggests it's (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, this is conflicting. Because according to relativity, the speed should be c=1, regardless of the medium's motion.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is not about the speed of light in a vacuum, but the speed within the moving medium. Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. But if the medium is moving, perhaps the lab frame would measure a different speed.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame must be c, regardless. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 1.

But then why does the velocity addition formula give a different result?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Newtonian addition of velocities, which is wrong, but the options don't include 1 in all cases except for B. Let me see:

If the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the glass's frame. Then in the lab frame, using Newtonian addition, the speed would be v_light + v. But if v is in the same direction as the light, that would be (c/n) + v. But that can't be right because when v is significant, it could exceed c, which isn't allowed.

But according to relativity, the correct formula is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v/c² ). So when c=1, it becomes (u' +v)/(1 +u' v).

But the speed of light in the glass's frame is u' = 1/n. So substituting, we get (1/n +v)/(1 + (1/n)*v ). Which simplifies to (1 +n v )/(n +v ), as I did earlier.

But wait, according to relativity, when you add velocities, the speed of light remains c. So in the lab frame, the speed of light should be c=1. So why is the calculation giving a different result?

Ah, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u' = 1/n. Then, when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, the lab would see the light as moving at u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v ), which would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n )).

Wait, this expression equals (1 + n v)/(n + v ), as before.

But according to relativity, this can't be more than 1. Let's test for v approaching 1, n being a small number.

Wait, n is the refractive index, which is greater than 1 for most materials. Let's say n=2, and v=0.8.

Then u = (1 +2*0.8)/(2 +0.8 )= (2.6)/(2.8)≈ 0.9286, which is less than 1. So that works.

Wait, but when n=1, u = (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is correct.

So according to the calculation, the speed is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

But that would mean that the speed is less than c, which is correct because the medium is moving, but the light's speed in the lab frame is less than c. Hmm, but earlier I thought the speed of light in any frame is c. Now I'm confused.

Wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, the light is moving through the moving medium. But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c. So am I mixing up the frames?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But according to relativity, in the lab frame, the speed of light must be c, regardless of the medium's motion.

So maybe the correct answer is B) 1.

But then why does the velocity addition formula give a different value?

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the glass is moving, and the light is inside it, but in the lab frame, the speed of light is c, so the answer is 1.

But that would imply that the calculation using the velocity addition formula is incorrect. Which is possible if the problem is considering the velocity of the light as seen in the lab, which must be c.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) 1, and the velocity addition approach is not applicable because the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light.

But wait, that contradicts the velocity addition formula. So I'm getting conflicting conclusions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intending to use the Newtonian approach, which would give (1/n +v). But that's not one of the options. The options are (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is A, or 1, which is B.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 'the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory.' So is the speed of light in the glass, but observed in the lab? So perhaps that's not the same as the speed of light in a vacuum.

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the speed of light in vacuum is c, but in the glass, it's v = c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the light as moving in the moving glass. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. When the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, the lab would measure the speed as v_light + v, but only in Newtonian terms. But in relativity, it's (v_light + v)/(1 + v_light v/c²).

So substituting v_light = c/n and c=1, the speed is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Which is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), option A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light is always c in the lab frame. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light inside it is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. So perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is (1/n +v)/(1 + (1/n) v ), which is (n +v )/(n +v ) when n=1, which gives 1. That works.

Wait, no, when n=1, the glass is vacuum, so the speed of light in the lab would be (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, as expected.

But when n=2, v=0.5, then the speed is (1 +2*0.5)/(2 +0.5 )= (2)/(2.5)=0.8, which is less than c=1. That makes sense because the light is moving through a medium, so its speed is slower.

Wait, so according to this, the correct answer is A) (1 +n v)/(n +v ).

But then why is the speed of light in the lab frame not always c? Because the light is in a medium, not in a vacuum. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is c/n plus the medium's velocity, but according to relativity, the overall speed can't exceed c.

Wait, but in the scenario, the light is in the glass, so the speed of light in the lab is (1/n +v)/(1 + (v/n) ), which as I calculated, is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is less than c=1 if n>1 and v is positive.

Wait, but let me plug in some numbers. Let's say n=2, v=0.5.

(1 +2*0.5 )/(2 +0.5 )= (2)/(2.5)=0.8 <1. So that's correct.

But what if v=0.9 and n=1. Then (1 +1*0.9)/(1 +0.9 )=1.9/1.9=1, which is correct.

Another test: n=3, v=0.8.

(1 +3*0.8)/(3 +0.8 )= (3.4)/(3.8 ) ≈0.8947 <1.

So in all cases, the speed is less than or equal to 1, which matches relativity.

So the correct answer seems to be option A.

But earlier I thought the speed of light in any frame must be c, but now I see that this is about the speed of light in the medium, not in a vacuum. So it's the speed of light in the glass, which is different.

Wait, the question is about 'the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.' So it's the speed of the light as measured in the lab, which is moving through the glass. So according to the calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v ), option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must account for the motion of the glass and the light beam. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Since the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory, the speed of light in the laboratory frame must be calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Given that the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \), and substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This expression represents the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory. Testing edge cases confirms its validity:

1. **When \( v = 0 \):** The speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct for light in a stationary medium.
2. **When \( n = 1 \):** The glass behaves like a vacuum, and the speed becomes \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.
3. **When \( n > 1 \):** The speed is always less than 1, as expected for light traveling through a medium.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\text{Answer: A}
\]
