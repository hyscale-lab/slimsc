Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

First, let me look at the reactions provided.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but I recall that for the formation of a cyanohydrin, you need a ketone or aldehyde reacting with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst, right?

So, the reaction is probably a cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN, but wait, wait—no, I think the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, making an intermediate which then takes a proton to form the cyanohydrin. And the acid catalyst would help in that protonation step.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. The acid, reagent A, would help in the protonation steps. So, the possible reagents are usually something like H3O+ (like in HCl or H2SO4), or maybe something else. Oh wait, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a source of H+ and SO3^- for such reactions because it's a strong acid and provides the necessary H+.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The starting material is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but let's see the structure. Oh, wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which upon adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH(CH2CN)(OH)(CH2CH3)—Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN in a four-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have four carbons, with the nitrile on carbon 1, the hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2. So structure would be: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no. Let me count. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's not quite right. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but perhaps I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, so the reagent A is an acid catalyst, either H3O+ (like in HCl or H2SO4) or perhaps something else.

So, for the first reaction, NaCN and an acid catalyst (like H3O+ or H2SO4) would be needed. Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+, option C has A as NaHSO3. So, I'll need to think about whether H3O+ is a suitable catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes H2SO4 or HCl is used, which would provide H+.

But the product is formed via acid catalysis. So for the first step, the reagent A is an acid, either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, what's NaHSO3? Sodium bisulfite? No, NaHSO3 is disodium hydrogen sulfate, which in solution would dissociate into H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, so NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which can act as an acid (HSO3^- is a weak acid). So if A is NaHSO3, perhaps it provides H+ and the bisulfite ion.

So, for the first reaction, either H3O+ (like from HCl) or NaHSO3 could be possible. Hmm.

Now moving to the second reaction. The reactant is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but under what conditions does a nitrile convert to a carboxylic acid? I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles can give amides, carboxylic acids, or ketones, depending on the conditions. For example, acidic hydrolysis with strong acid and water, or under basic conditions.

But wait, the starting material here is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, the structure is something like R-C(OH)(R')-CN, where R is 4-benzylphenyl and R' is some other group. Wait, perhaps it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile attached to a benzyl group, but the exact structure might not matter for the reagents.

So, the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. How is that done? I think typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions, often using HCl or H2SO4 in aqueous conditions, with heat. Alternatively, using a strong base like NaOH and heat, followed by acid workup.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but that's probably part of the hydrolysis. So, what catalyst or condition is needed?

Wait, looking at the second reaction: the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile (RCN) → RCOOH. The hydrolysis reaction. For that, under acidic conditions, you can have HCl in water, with heat. Or maybe under basic conditions, like with aqueous NaOH, but that would give a carboxylate, which would then need acid workup.

In the options for B, the possible reagents are either HCl or CH3COOH for options A and B, and HCl or CH3COOH for D. Wait, looking at the options, options A and B for B are HCl and CH3COOH. Hmm, but what conditions are needed for the nitrile to acid conversion.

Wait, the reaction is from nitrile to acid. So, to go from RCN to RCOOH, you need either strong acid or strong base. So, for acidic conditions, you would typically use concentrated HCl with heat, perhaps in a mixture with water. Alternatively, sometimes H2SO4 is used as the acid.

But looking at the options, for B, the options are HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so maybe for a selective reaction. Wait, but the starting material is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile. So, if you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you have to make sure that any other functional groups are compatible. The starting molecule has a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon as the nitrile.

Wait, when a nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, it typically requires strong acid or strong base. So, perhaps using HCl (a strong acid) in water would be the method. Alternatively, using a strong base like NaOH, but that would give the carboxylate, which would require acid workup.

But in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but I think that the actual reagent is the acid or base used in the hydrolysis. Wait, the problem states that in the second reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So, B is the catalyst or the acid/base condition. Because H2O is part of the reaction, the other part is reagent B.

So, in the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So, if B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic. If B is CH3COOH, it's a weak acid.

Wait, but for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids, which is more common? From what I remember, nitriles are usually hydrolyzed under strong acidic conditions (like HCl with heat) or under strong basic conditions (like NaOH with heat, followed by acid workup). So, using HCl in water would be a possible condition.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B= HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if in the second reaction, B is HCl, then only options A and C are possible. Now, for the first reaction, which reagent A would be correct.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So, the cyanide is adding to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The catalyst for this is an acid. So, the reagent A could be H3O+ (like from HCl) or another acid.

So, looking at the options, if A is H3O+, then option A and B would be possible. Wait, but option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl, which we think is correct for the second reaction. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So, which is correct for the first reaction.

Wait, sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is also an acid. So, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, that would supply H+ as well. But what's the role in the first reaction?

Wait, when a ketone reacts with CN-, the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The protonation and deprotonation steps are facilitated by an acid catalyst. So, any acid would work. H3O+ is a strong acid, but NaHSO3 (which would provide H+ and SO3^2-) is a weaker acid. Wait, HSO3^- is a weak acid, so NaHSO3 would not be as strong as H3O+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, do we need a specific condition? Maybe the reaction uses a milder acid to prevent any side reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can be catalyzed by either strong or weak acids.

Wait, but I think that for the formation of cyanohydrins, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions, such as using HCl (a strong acid) as the catalyst because the cyanide is a strong base and requires acidic conditions to function as a nucleophile. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as the catalyst.

So, in the first reaction, reagent A is either H3O+ (like from HCl) or NaHSO3. But NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. I'm not sure, but perhaps both can work. But looking at the options, only options A and C have A as H3O+ and NaHSO3, respectively.

Wait, but if A is H3O+, then the first reaction would use HCl (like H3O+ is provided by HCl), and the second reaction would also use HCl (option A). But in the second reaction, would HCl be the right choice? Because the second step is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which can be done under HCl in H2O.

Alternatively, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A, then the second reaction uses HCl as B, which would make option C.

But wait, I thought that in the first reaction, the nitrile is added to the ketone via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. So, which acid is more suitable?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first reaction uses H2SO4 as the catalyst. But H3O+ is present in solutions like HCl or H2SO4. So, for the first reaction, either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could be the reagent A, depending on which is more suitable.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is done with a solution of NaCN and H3O+ (like HCl), leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, if A is H3O+ (option A and B), then the second reaction uses B as HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). But for the second reaction, I think HCl is more likely the correct reagent for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

So, option A has B as HCl, which would fit. So, combining both reactions, the first uses H3O+ (A) and the second uses HCl (B). So, option A would be correct.

But wait, let me think again. Let's consider the structures:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN and acid (H3O+), the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, that structure makes sense.

Second reaction: the nitrile group (CN) is converted to COOH. So, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So, under what conditions does that happen? Under acidic or basic conditions. But since the starting material has a hydroxyl group, perhaps acidic conditions are better to prevent deprotonation of the hydroxyl group, which is a secondary alcohol and might not be as acidic as a phenol. So, in a basic condition, the OH could lose a proton and become O^-, but in acidic conditions, it's protonated.

Wait, but in the second reaction, with H2O and B, which is a reagent. So, if B is HCl, the solution is strongly acidic. That would protonate the OH group, turning it into an -OH2^+ group, which is stable.

So, in the nitrile hydrolysis, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would first be protonated on the carbon, making it more electrophilic. Then, water attacks, leading to the formation of an imidamide intermediate, followed by further hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

So, using HCl (a strong acid) would facilitate this process. So, the second reaction uses B as HCl.

Thus, for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (from HCl), and for the second reaction, B is HCl. Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which fits.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C is A = NaHSO3, B=HCl.

So, why would NaHSO3 be used in the first reaction?

Wait, sometimes in the formation of cyanohydrins, NaHSO3 is used as the catalyst because it provides H+ and bisulfite ions. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Another thought: sometimes, when working with nitrile formation, H2SO4 is used as a catalyst, but in this case, the options don't have H2SO4 as a choice.

Hmm, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, so HCl is the source of H3O+. Then, the second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst. Alternatively, another option is that for the second reaction, B is HCl, making the correct answer option A.

Wait, but if I'm not certain, perhaps I should think about the hydrolysis of nitriles.

Wait, another point: in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Upon hydrolysis, it becomes 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The -CN becomes -COOH. So, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions would require HCl in aqueous solution, perhaps with heat.

In the options, only option A and C have B as HCl. So, for the second reaction, HCl is correct.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (A = H3O+), then option A is correct. But if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 (A = NaHSO3), then option C is correct.

Wait, which acid is more suitable for the first reaction? The formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone and NaCN. I think that the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions, often using HCl as the catalyst because CN- is a weak nucleophile and needs an acid to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So, if the first reaction uses HCl (as H3O+), then A is H3O+.

Thus, the correct reagents would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.


The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where a ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid facilitates the protonation of the carbonyl carbon, making it more electrophilic, and helps in the formation of the cyanohydrin. Possible acid catalysts include H₃O⁺ (from HCl) or NaHSO₃. Both can act as acids, but H₃O⁺ (from HCl) is a stronger acid and is commonly used in such reactions.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, HCl in water is a common choice, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction. CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less suitable for this transformation.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl):**  
  H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for the first reaction, and HCl is appropriate for the second reaction as it provides the strong acidic conditions needed for nitrile hydrolysis. This option fits both reactions.

- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH):**  
  While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl):**  
  NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction, but HCl is still the better choice for the second reaction. However, NaHSO₃ is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation compared to H₃O⁺, making this option less favorable.

- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH):**  
  NaHSO₃ is suitable for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
