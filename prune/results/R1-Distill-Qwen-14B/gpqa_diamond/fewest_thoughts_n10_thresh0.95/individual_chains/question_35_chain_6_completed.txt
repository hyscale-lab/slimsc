Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. So, they've given that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c times S. The constant c is h/(4π). Hmm, I remember that h is Planck's constant, but wait, sometimes people use ħ which is h/(2π). So c here is (h)/(4π) = ħ/2. Oh right, because ħ is h/(2π), so c is ħ/2. So, Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

The matrix S is given. Its first row is (0, -i), second row is (i, 0). Wait, that's a familiar structure. Oh, right! That's the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles. So, S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues a and the eigenvectors φ of the matrix Ay.

First, let me write down what Ay is. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π) = ħ/2, so Ay = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix.

Multiplying each element by ħ/(2), the matrix becomes:

Ay = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

So, the elements are:
Row 1: 0, (-i)(ħ/2)
Row 2: (i)(ħ/2), 0.

But wait, when calculating eigenvalues, the matrix entries' actual values matter, but perhaps it's easier to first find the eigenvalues of S and then scale them by c.

Alternatively, since Ay is a scaled version of S, perhaps the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

So, what are the eigenvalues of S, the Pauli Y matrix? The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Let me compute the trace and determinant to find eigenvalues. The trace of S is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - ( -i )(i ) = 0 - (-i * i) = - (i^2) = -( -1) = 1. Because the determinant formula for a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] is ad - bc. So for S, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) = 0 - (-(-1)) because i squared is -1. Wait, wait, i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is 1. So determinant is 1. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0 → λ² + 1 = 0 → λ² = -1 → λ = ±i. Wait, wait, that's not right. Because the Pauli matrices, like X, Y, Z, have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2, but wait, let's think again.

Wait, no. The Pauli Y matrix (the S here) is the actual matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix are ±i. Let me double-check. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving det(S - λ I) =0.

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The characteristic equation is:

| -λ   -i      |
| i     -λ |  = 0

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i * -i) = λ² - ( -i² ). Wait, (i)(-i) is (-i²) which is 1 because i squared is -1. So λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² =1 → λ = ±1. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute the determinant again.

The determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( -i² ). i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) is (-i²) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1. Setting to 0: λ²=1 → λ= ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

Wait, that makes more sense. So for the matrix S, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is (c) * S, would be c * 1 and c * (-1). So a = c and a = -c.

Given that c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2, because ħ = h/(2π), so c is ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/2) *1 = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2. 

Wait, but looking at the options, probably they're using a different notation. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but our eigenvalues are real numbers, ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Since ħ is h/(2π), substituting, a = (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, no imaginary parts. So any option that claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also, eigenvalues are real, so this would be wrong.

Option C: Eigenvectors of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 particles, A² is ( (ħ/2)^2 )(I), where I is identity matrix. So for any eigenstate of Ay, A² would have the same eigenvalue, so the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A². So option C is incorrect in saying they can't be eigenfunctions of Az. Because Ay and Az don't commute, so eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So option C's second part is correct, but the first part is incorrect because they can be eigenfunctions of A². So the entire statement is incorrect.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions are typically the eigenvectors. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two orthogonal eigenvectors which form a basis for the vector space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator Ay. So this statement is correct.

But wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions form a basis, but any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for their eigenspaces. Since Ay is 2x2, it's a two-dimensional space, so the eigenvectors would form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. The eigenvalues are real and equal to ±h/(4π), so the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and no imaginary parts. So only options that don't mention imaginary parts are correct. So looking back, option D is about the eigenfunctions, which I think is correct.

Now, looking at the options again, which statement is correct during the calculation?

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That makes sense, because Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option D is correct. So during the calculation, I would consider option D to be correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is represented as a 2×2 matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as shown by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:
     \[
     a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - These eigenvalues are real, with no imaginary components.

2. **Eigenvectors and Basis Functions:**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space. This is consistent with the fact that any 2×2 matrix operator has eigenvectors that span the space.
   - Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of \( A_y \) are indeed the basis functions of the operator.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (since \( A^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix), but they are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option D**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are indeed the basis functions of the operator.

Answer: D
