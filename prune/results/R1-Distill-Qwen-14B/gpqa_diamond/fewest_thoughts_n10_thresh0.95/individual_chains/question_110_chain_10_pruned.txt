Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the HIRES spectrograph. Let me go through each star step by step. 

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star that is brighter than 17 mag would be observable by both, but if it's fainter than 17 but brighter than 16, only ESPRESSO can't, but HIRES can.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag (i.e., apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17) can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag less than or equal to 16 mag. So for a star to be visible by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude that is ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So only stars with V ≤16 mag can be seen by both.

Wait, no, because ESPRESSO can go up to V=17, so if a star is V=17, HIRES can't observe it (since it's beyond 16). So only stars with V <=16 mag can be observed by both. So I need to find stars with apparent V magnitude ≤16.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude. Others have apparent, so that's easier.

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula to calculate apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for d=10, log10(1) is 0, so m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent mag is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's visible by both. But wait, does this star's position matter? The observatories are at different locations. Oh, but the question tells us to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, so we don't need to worry about whether the telescopes can actually see the star due to location or elevation. So position doesn't matter. So Star1's apparent mag is 15.5. So both can observe it.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. That's above 16, so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can, because 16.5 <17. So only ESPRESSO can see it. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, there's more. It has E(B-V) =0.6 mag, which affects the V band. The total absorption is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the extinction (A_V) is 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude needs to be corrected for extinction. So the observed V mag is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So the star's apparent V mag is 15.5, but after extinction, it's brighter or fainter? Wait, extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher (fainter). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: if a star has a lot of dust between us, it dims, so its apparent magnitude (which is how bright it looks) would be higher (since lower magnitudes are brighter). So, if the star's actual apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction of 1.86 mag, then the observed (fainter) m is 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36 mag. So when they say apparent V mag is 15.5, but with extinction, the observed V mag is 17.36. But wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" — that probably already accounts for extinction. Or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, wait, the question says: Star3's "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and E(B-V) =0.6 mag. So perhaps the star's actual apparent magnitude is 15.5, but considering extinction, it's brighter or dimmer? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The V magnitude given is the observed one, which already accounts for extinction. So the E(B-V) is the color excess, which is used to compute the extinction in V band. Wait, wait, the problem statement says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So, perhaps the given apparent V magnitude is the observed (after extinction) value. So, to find the intrinsic magnitude, you subtract the absorption. Wait, no. Let me think again. The E(B-V) is the difference between the observed B-V and the intrinsic B-V. The total absorption in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed V magnitude is m = M + A_V + 5 log10(d/10). Or wait, perhaps not. Let me get this right.

Wait, the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without extinction. The apparent magnitude m is M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V. Because extinction (A_V) makes the star appear fainter, so you add it to the magnitude. So, if a star has an absolute magnitude M, then without extinction, m0 = M +5 log(d/10). With extinction, m = m0 + A_V.

So for Star3: It's given as apparent V magnitude 15.5, which is after accounting for distance but before extinction. Wait, the problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance." So maybe the 15.5 is the observed (apparent) magnitude, which includes the extinction. So perhaps the apparent magnitude is already m = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, the problem statement for Star3 says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6 mag." So the V magnitude given is the observed, which includes extinction. So in that case, the true apparent magnitude would be lower (brighter) because the extinction (dust) makes it dimmer. So what's the m_true? So m_true = m_observed - A_V. Because the observed is m_true plus extinction. So, m_true = 15.5 - (3.1 * 0.6) = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64 mag.

Wait, but why is that? Because if the star is behind dust, the observed V is dimmer (higher m). So the true V without dust would be brighter (lower m). So m_true = m_observed - A_V.

But wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. The formula is: m_observed = m_true + A_V. So to get m_true, subtract A_V.

So for Star3, m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the actual apparent magnitude, without extinction, would be 13.64, which is brighter than 15.5. But for the purpose of detection, the observed magnitude is what matters. Because the telescopes observe the star through the dust. So if the apparent V is 15.5, which is after considering extinction, then we can just use that.

Wait, no, the question says that the parameters given for the stars are their actual magnitudes. So, for Star3, the apparent V mag is 15.5, but considering extinction, the observed magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36 mag. Oh wait, but the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, which is the observed magnitude. So that's the m we should use.

Wait no, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude. Let me think. No, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance." So the apparent magnitude is already what you would observe—so that's the m. So regardless of extinction, that's the observed m. But that can't be right, because extinction would make it appear fainter. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the E(B-V) is the reddening. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me read the note again. The note says, "the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So the observed m is m_true + A_V.

So if the given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, that's the observed m. So m_observed =15.5. So m_true = m_observed - A_V =15.5-1.86=13.64. So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is 13.64. That's a brighter star. But wait, why would we care about the true magnitude? The telescopes are observing the star through dust, so the apparent magnitude they see is 15.5. So when considering whether the star is bright enough for the spectrographs, we should use the observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, but no. Because the brightness the spectrograph detects would be the observed brightness, including extinction. So when the question says that a star is observable by a spectrograph if it's brighter than a certain apparent magnitude, they're considering the observed magnitude.

So for Star3, the observed apparent mag is 15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe it because 15.5 <16 (HIRES can) and 15.5 <17 (ESPRESSO can). So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, but no, because I think I messed up the interpretation. Let me think again. The problem says that the parameters given for the stars are their apparent V magnitudes. But for Star3, the given apparent V mag is 15.5, but it's located 15 pc away, but that's irrelevant because apparent magnitude is already a measure of brightness as seen from Earth, irrespective of distance. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, so it's bright enough for both. So yes, Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. Distance is 10 pc. So I need to compute its apparent magnitude. 

Absolute magnitude M=15.5. Distance d=10 pc. So m0 (without extinction) = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(0)=15.5. Then, the extinction A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m_observed is 16.74.

Wait, but that's the observed apparent magnitude. So this star's observed m is 16.74. That's above 16, so HIRES can't observe it (since HIRES requires m <=16). ESPRESSO can, as m=16.74 <17. So Star4 can only be observed by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me recheck. For Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m0 is 15.5. Then, extinction adds A_V=1.24, so observed m is 16.74. So yes, that's correct. So Star4's observed m is 16.74. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V mag=16.5, distance 5 pc. So compute m0 (without extinction): M=16.5, d=5. So m0=16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m0 is approximately 15.0. Now, does it have any extinction? The problem says E(B-V) is 0.4 mag (I think not; the problem says for Star4, E(B-V)=0.4. Star5's description doesn't mention E(B-V), so no extinction. So m_observed = m0 =15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0. So both telescopes can observe it because 15<=16 and 15<=17.

Wait, but wait, the problem says Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m0
