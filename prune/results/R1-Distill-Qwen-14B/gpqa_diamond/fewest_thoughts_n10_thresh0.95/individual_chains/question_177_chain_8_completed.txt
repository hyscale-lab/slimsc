Okay, so I have this question about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so I think mass might not be directly relevant here. Or maybe it's a red herring? I'm not sure yet.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because the constant b is the same for both.

Wait, but how about the radial velocities? Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, I remember that radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. So the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength due to the star's motion towards or away from us.

So, the peak wavelengths they observed are the same, but the actual rest wavelengths (which depend on their temperatures) might be different because of Doppler shifting. So first, I need to figure out the actual temperatures of the stars.

The Doppler effect formula is approximately (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, it's longer (red shift). But in this case, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so no shift. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. But which direction? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2 is moving towards us because velocity is positive if moving away? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think the radial velocity is positive when moving away (redshift), negative when moving towards (blueshift). So if Star_2's radial velocity is +700, it's moving away, so its light is redshifted.

But the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. So for Star_1, lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 because v_r is zero. For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = (1 + v_r2/c) * lambda_rest2. But according to the problem, lambda_obs1 equals lambda_obs2.

So:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = (1 + v_r2/c) * lambda_rest2.

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

lambda_rest1 = b / T1
lambda_rest2 = b / T2

So substituting into the first equation:

b/(T1) = (1 + v_r2/c) * (b/(T2))

The b's cancel out, so:

1/(T1) = (1 + v_r2/c) * (1/T2)
=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c)

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v_r2/c. Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333. So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.023333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.023333 ≈ T2 * 0.9773.

So Star_1 has a lower temperature than Star_2. But wait, Star_1 is larger in radius and mass. Oh, but luminosity is determined by radius and temperature. So what's the luminosity formula again?

Luminosity of a star (assuming black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since 4π σ is a constant, L is proportional to R² T^4.

So, for Star_1 and Star_2:

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

We have T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9773 T2.

So substituting:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (0.9773 T2)^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * (0.9773^4 T2^4) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

The R2² and T2^4 terms cancel out, so:

= 2.25 * (0.9773)^4

Compute 0.9773^4. Let me calculate that.

First, 0.9773 squared is approximately (0.9773)^2 ≈ 0.955.

Then square that: (0.955)^2 ≈ 0.912.

Wait, wait, let's compute more accurately.

0.9773^2:

Let me compute 0.9773 * 0.9773.

0.9773 * 0.9773.

= (0.97 + 0.0073)^2

But maybe a better way is to compute it as:

= 0.9773 * 0.9773

Calculating step by step:

= (9773e-4)^2 = (9773^2) e-8.

Wait, maybe easier to approximate.

0.9773 * 0.9773.

= (1 - 0.0227)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0227 + (0.0227)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0454 + 0.000515 ≈ 0.955115.

Wait, but 0.0227^2 is about 0.000515.

So 1 - 0.0454 = 0.9546, plus 0.000515 is 0.955115.

So approx 0.9551.

Now, 0.9551 squared is (approx):

0.9551^2 = (0.95 + 0.0051)^2

= 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.0051 + 0.0051^2

= 0.9025 + 0.00993 + 0.000026

= 0.9025 + 0.00993 is 0.91243, plus 0.000026 is ~0.912456.

So 0.9773^4 ≈ 0.912456.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.912456 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.912456.

Let me compute 2 * 0.912456 = 1.824912.

0.25 * 0.912456 = 0.228114.

Adding together: 1.824912 + 0.228114 = 2.053026.

So approximately 2.053.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 2.23 or 2.35. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the actual calculation for temperature is different. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the observed wavelength is the same, so for Star_2, the peak wavelength is observed to be longer (because v_r is positive, moving away). So observed lambda is longer than the rest wavelength.

Wait, for Star_1: lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

For Star_2: lambda2_obs = (1 + v_r2/c) * lambda2_rest.

But the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_rest = (1 + v_r2/c) * lambda2_rest.

From Wien's law, lambda = b/T, so lambda1_rest = b / T1, lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting into the first equation:

b / T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) * (b / T2)

The b's cancel, so 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) * 1/T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c)

Wait, that's correct. So T1 is lower than T2.

But earlier when I computed v_r2/c, I think I made a mistake. Because v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute 700 / (3e5) accurately.

700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000.

Simplify: 7/3000 = 0.002333333... So approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v_r2/c = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 700/3e5 was 0.02333. No, that's 700/3e4, but 3e5 is 300,000, so 700/300,000 is 0.002333, not 0.02333. Ohhh, that’s a big mistake. So that changes everything.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 = approximately 0.99767 * T2.

So T1 is about 99.767% of T2. So the temperature difference is small.

Now, let's compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (0.99767 T2)^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2^2) * (0.99767)^4 T2^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

The R2^2 and T2^4 terms cancel, so:

= 2.25 * (0.99767)^4

Compute (0.99767)^4.

Approximating: ln(x)^n is easier perhaps, but perhaps just compute step by step.

0.99767^2 = ?

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.00233)^2.

= 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 0.99534 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 0.995345.

Then, square that number to get 0.99767^4.

So, 0.995345^2.

Again, compute as (1 - 0.004655)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.99069 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907116.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907116.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907116 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total approx 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

But wait, 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007, but wait, 0.9907 is 0.99 plus 0.0007? No, 0.9907 is 0.99 plus 0.0007? No, 0.99 is 0.9900, so 0.9907 is 0.99 plus 0.0007.

But actually, 0.9907 is 0.9907, so 0.9907 = 0.99 + 0.0007.

Wait, no, 0.9907 is 99.07% of 1.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ Let's compute:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So adding, 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, the choices are A: ~2.25, B: ~2.32, C: ~2.35, D: ~2.23.

So 2.229 is very close to D: ~2.23.

Wait, but another way: perhaps I should compute (0.99767)^4 more accurately.

Alternative approach: Compute 0.99767^4.

First, compute 0.99767 squared:

0.99767 * 0.99767.

Let me compute 0.99767 * 0.99767:

= (1 - 0.00233) * (1 - 0.00233)

= 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2

= 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289

= 0.9953454289.

Now, square that: (0.9953454289)^2.

= (1 - 0.0046545711)^2

= 1 - 2*0.0046545711 + (0.0046545711)^2

Compute each term:

2*0.0046545711 ≈ 0.0093091422.

(0.0046545711)^2 ≈ (approx 0.00002166).

So,

1 - 0.0093091422 = 0.9906908578.

Plus 0.00002166 gives 0.9907125178.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907125.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907125 = ?

2.25 * 0.9907125:

We can break it down:

2 * 0.9907125 = 1.981425.

0.25 * 0.9907125 = 0.247678125.

Adding together: 1.981425 + 0.247678125 = 2.229103125.

So approximately 2.2291.

Which is approximately 2.229, which is very close to option D: ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2.
   - The observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same, implying their rest wavelengths are related by Doppler shifts.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - Luminosity is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Doppler Shift and Temperature**:
   Using the Doppler shift formula, the observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + v_r / c) \lambda_{\text{rest}}
   \]
   Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = (1 + v_{r2} / c) \lambda_{\text{rest,2}}
   \]
   From Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1 / T \), so:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + v_{r2} / c}
   \]
   Substituting \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   v_{r2} / c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
   \]
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + 0.002333} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.99767
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   The luminosity of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = 0.99767 T_2 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (0.99767 T_2)^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99767)^4
   \]
   Compute \( (0.99767)^4 \):
   - \( (0.99767)^2 \approx 0.995345 \)
   - \( (0.995345)^2 \approx 0.990712 \)
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990712 \approx 2.229
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This matches option **D**.

Answer: D
