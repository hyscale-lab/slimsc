Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So that probably means their density is uniform in space. Uniform distribution implies that the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So, more distant stars would occupy a larger volume but have the same density, so the number depends on how volume relates to distance.

Parallax, plx, is related to distance. I remember that parallax in arcseconds (like plx) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance (d). So d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if I think about a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. The number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

But the volume depends on the distance. Let me think about how to express dV in terms of plx.

In spherical coordinates, the volume element at a distance d and thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Because each shell at distance d has a surface area of 4πd², and thickness dd, so the volume is 4πd² dd.

So, the number of stars between d and d+dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute d in terms of plx. Also, dd is the change in d corresponding to a change in plx, dplx.

Wait, let me find dd in terms of dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because derivative of 1/plx is -1/plx² dplx. So, dd = - dplx / plx².

But when I'm integrating, I can just take absolute values, so the negative sign won't matter for the number of stars.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume element:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is expressed in terms of dplx. From earlier, dd = (dplx / plx²), because I think I might have messed up the signs earlier. Wait, no, from d = 1/plx, taking differential:

dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) → 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, let me recheck that. Wait, dV is 4πd² dd.

d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

dd = (dplx / plx²) → because when plx increases, d decreases.

So, substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) → 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in a dplx range is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, if we take dV and divide by dplx, the number of stars per unit plx is n * 4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, no. Wait, the number of stars in a range dplx is n * 4π d² dd, but we have to express it in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx as N = n * (volume between those plx's).

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a spherical shell from d=1/(plx) to d=1/(plx + dplx). But wait, that might get complicated, perhaps it's better to think in terms of differential.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is n * 4π d² (dd/dplx) )

Wait, no, because N = n * 4π d² dd. But dd is the change in d corresponding to a change dplx. So, dd = (d dplx) * (dd/dplx).

Wait, let me think about the relationship between d and plx. Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides: dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx → d d = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is:

dN = n * 4π d^2 dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = (dplx)/plx^2.

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) → dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So dN/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the options are about the number per unit range of plx. So, if I'm considering a unit increase in plx (dplx=1), then the number is 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another way to think about it: the volume element in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, the volume element dV in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d) where d d is dd. And from plx, dd = d (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but I think earlier reasoning leads to the number per plx being proportional to 1/plx^4.

But another approach: consider that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d (thickness dd) is N = n * 4π d² dd.

Express this in terms of plx. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But since dN is positive, we can write:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx → dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Which is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer is option A.

But wait, another approach: Think about the number of stars within a certain distance range. Since density is uniform, the number of stars in a sphere of radius d is proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)π d^3.

But wait, but in the question, they're asking about per unit parallax. Parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/plx.

So, the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the sphere of radius d=1/plx minus the number in d=1/(plx + dplx). But perhaps that's complicating things, and the differential approach is better.

Wait, but in the differential approach, dN is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which is option A.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant. Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \), we find \( d^2 = 1/\text{plx}^2 \). Additionally, \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of \( d\text{plx} \) as:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Answer: A
