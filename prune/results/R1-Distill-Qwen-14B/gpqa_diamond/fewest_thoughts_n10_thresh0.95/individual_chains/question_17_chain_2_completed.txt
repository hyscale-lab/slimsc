Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is related to the stability of the complex. So when you have a complex like Ca-EDTA, the Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. The formula would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So that must be the concentration of the CaEDTA^2- ion. Since the complex is formed from one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- ion, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So, the initial concentrations before any dissociation would be [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be zero. But in reality, some of the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The equilibrium expression for this would be Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). But wait, I might have that backwards. Oh right, Kf is defined as [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So yes, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / [Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

But in this case, the complex is the only thing present initially. So, when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let's think about how much dissociates.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x

But wait, since Kf is so large (5e10), which is a very big number, that means the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So x should be very small compared to 0.02. Therefore, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the Kf equation:

Kf ≈ 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We can solve for x.

So,

x² = 0.02 / Kf

Wait, no, let's rearrange:

Kf = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / Kf → x = sqrt(0.02 / Kf )

Wait, let me recheck. Kf is 5e10, which is 5e10 = 5 x 10^10.

So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10 )

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 1e-6.5 = 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7 is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13) more carefully. 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. Which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is x, which is about 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't swap the Kf expression. Another way is to write the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reaction would be 1/Kf, because Kf is formation. So K_dissociation = 1/Kf.

So, the expression would be K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

Which is 1/(5e10) = x^2 / 0.02 → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → same as before.

So that seems to confirm it. So x is sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) = sqrt(4e-13) = ~6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate \( K_d \) as:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x
\]

Since \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**
