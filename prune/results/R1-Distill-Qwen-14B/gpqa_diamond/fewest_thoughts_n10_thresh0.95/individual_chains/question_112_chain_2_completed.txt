Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that we have an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think we need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, implying that we need to find the actual coefficients by normalizing.

Then, the second part asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about what kind of matrix that would be.

So, for a 2x2 matrix since there are two states, |up> and |down>. The diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, this is a spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, so this matrix is actually proportional to the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of S_x.

But wait, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up>, |down>), but the operator's eigenstates are in the x-basis. So we need to express |alpha> in the x-basis, perhaps, to find the probabilities.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Normalize the state |alpha>.
2. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator (which are the eigenstates of S_x).
3. Find the probabilities, which would be the square of the coefficients in this new basis.
4. Compute the average value of the operator.

Let me start with the first step: normalization.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.
The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients. So the coefficients are a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). Compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

|a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1+1=2.
|b|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but wait a second. Are |up> and |down> orthonormal? Yes, because they're eigenstates of the spin-z operator, so their inner product is zero, and each has unit length. So the inner product of |alpha> with itself is |a|^2 + |b|^2, which is 7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the given operator. The operator's matrix is A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j. So as I thought earlier, this is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Let me denote the first eigenstate as |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the second as |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2}.

We need to express |alpha> in the basis {|+x>, |–x>} to find the expansion coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |–x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |–x>.

Our goal is to find c_+ and c_-.

To find c_+, we compute the inner product < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < –x | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+ first.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ) + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ) ]

Wait, actually, no, perhaps it's easier to compute using the components.

Let me express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the standard basis vectors. So:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Expressed as a vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The |+x> state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T and |–x> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T.

The inner product < +x | alpha > is the conjugate transpose of |+x> multiplied by |alpha>.

In components:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1*, 1*] multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: 1+i +2 -i = 3. So:

= (3) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

= 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, the coefficient c_+ is 3/sqrt(14).

So the probability of measuring the +ħ/2 eigenvalue is |c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. So that's the first probability.

Now, the other coefficient c_- is < –x | alpha >.

Compute that:

< –x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1*, (-1)*] • [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: (1 - 2) gives -1, and i + i = 2i. So numerator is (-1 +2i).

So:

= ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

The probability |c_-|^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (2 *7 ) = (1 +4 ) /14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, wait. Wait, |c_-|^2 is the square of the modulus of c_-, which is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] / (2*7) ) = (1+4)/(14) )=5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but adding the probabilities: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

But looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Looking at option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is around 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, what about the average value of the operator?

The operator is A, which has matrix elements [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So, the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, but for our operator, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

The average value (the expectation value) can be calculated as <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (ħ/2) * X, where X is the Pauli X matrix, then <A> = (ħ/2) <X>.

And the expectation value of X for the state |alpha> is (c_+^2 - c_-^2) multiplied by something? Or perhaps more accurately, the expectation value of X is (c_+^2 - c_-^2) multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, X is the Pauli X matrix, whose expectation value is (|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2) multiplied by something. Let me think.

The eigenstates |+x> and |–x> have eigenvalues +1 and -1 for X. So the expectation value of X is sum (eigenvalue * probability).

So <X> = (+1) * |c_+|^2 + (-1) * |c_-|^2 = (|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 )

We have |c_+|^2=9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <X> = (9/14 -5/14 )=4/14=2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * <X> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it all together: the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. So option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the expectation value.

Alternative approach: Compute <A> directly using matrix multiplication.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a column vector, [a; b], then <A> = [a*, b*] * A * [a; b].

Compute each term:

Compute A * |alpha>:

A * |alpha> = [ (0 * a + ħ/2 * b ), ( ħ/2 * a + 0 * b ) ].

Then, [a* , b* ] * A |alpha> = a* (A |alpha> )_1 + b* (A |alpha> )_2.

So:

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)( 2 Re(a* b )) = ħ Re(a* b )

Wait, because a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

So <A> = ħ Re( a* b ), where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1-i)(2 -i) ] / 7.

Multiply numerator: (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part of a* b is 1/7.

So <A> = ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7.

Yes, that's the same result as before. So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The coefficients are \( a = 1+i \) and \( b = 2-i \). The normalization factor is determined by the total squared magnitude of the coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 2, \quad |b|^2 = (2-i)(2+i) = 5, \quad |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli-X matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

We compute the expansion coefficients \( c_+ = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \) and \( c_- = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \). Using the inner product:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right),
\]

we substitute \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \). The result is:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Similarly, for \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \), respectively:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is computed using the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle \). Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value simplifies to:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha| \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for \( |\alpha\rangle \) is \( \text{Re}(a^* b) \), where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7} \), the real part is \( \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7} \). Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Combining the results, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches option A.
