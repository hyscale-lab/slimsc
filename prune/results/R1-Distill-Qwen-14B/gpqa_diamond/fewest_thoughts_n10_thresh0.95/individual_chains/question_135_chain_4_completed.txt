Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L = -λf f̄ ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm not sure if I got that right. Maybe it's better to parse the equation properly. Oh wait, perhaps it's L = -λ * f * f-bar * ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term is proportional to X(y) times fermion fields, maybe something like Yukawa coupling?

Then, the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the boson is enough to produce the particles. So, the allowed decays are those where the fermion mass is less than or equal to half the boson mass.

Wait, what's the mass of X here? 6 GeV. So half of that is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Now, I need to list the known fermion masses. Let's think about all the possible fermions that could be produced.

Quarks come in different flavors and have varying masses. Let's list them:

Up quark (u): very light, around 2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
Down quark (d): similar to up, maybe around 4-5 MeV
Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV (maybe around 100 MeV, so 0.1 GeV)
Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
Bottom quark (b): around 4.5-5 GeV (so 4.5 GeV)
Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so 173 > 3 GeV, so can't decay into top quarks.

Leptons:

Electron (e-): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ-): ~0.1 GeV
Tau (tau-): ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos: very light, negligible masses.

Wait, so for the fermion pairs X can decay into, their masses must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. So let's see:

b quark: 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks. So options mentioning b and anti-b would be wrong. Let's look at the options.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
Wait, but b's mass is about 4.5 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV must be at least 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV? No, 6 is less than 9, so it's not allowed. So option A is wrong because it includes b decay.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
c quark mass is about 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So 2*1.5=3 GeV. So c is allowed. s quark is 0.1 GeV, which is much less. u and d are even lighter. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, but X has mass 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56 GeV. So tau pair is allowed. Muon is 0.1 GeV, same as s. Electron is even lighter.

Wait, but wait. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2 * 1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56. So tau pair is allowed? So in option B, tau is included.

So for option B, do all the particles satisfy the mass requirement?

c: 1.5 GeV → allowed.
tau: 1.78 GeV → 2*1.78=3.56 ≤6 → allowed.
mu: 0.1 → allowed.
e: 0.0005 → allowed.
s: 0.1 → allowed.
u, d: negligible → allowed.

What about charm quark? 1.5 GeV is ok.

So option B includes all these, but what about the bottom quark? It's not in option B, so that's good because X's mass isn't sufficient to decay into b quarks.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But top quark is 173 GeV, which is way beyond 3 GeV. So X can't decay into t quarks. So option C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but b quark is 4.5 GeV. So 2*m(b) is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so 6 <9 → can't decay into b. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

So looking back, the correct decay channels would be all the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So which of the options includes the correct fermions?

Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all are allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the masses. 

Tau mass: 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is bigger than 3.56. So tau decay is allowed.

Charm quark: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV threshold. X is 6 GeV, so 6 ≥3 → allowed.

What about bottom quark? 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV threshold. X is 6 <9 → not allowed.

So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these are allowed.

Wait, but what about the other quarks? Let me list all the possible fermions:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t.

Leptons: e, mu, tau, and neutrinos.

But in the options, only charged leptons are listed.

So the allowed decays for X would be any fermion pair where each fermion has mass ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait: for each pair, the sum of the rest masses (times 2) must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So, for each pair:

b: no, as 2*4.5=9>6.

c: 2*1.5=3 ≤6 → allowed.

s: 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

u: 2*0.002=0.004 ≤6 → allowed.

d: 2*0.005=0.01 ≤6 → allowed.

e: 2*0.0005=0.001 ≤6 → allowed.

mu: 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

tau: 2*1.78=3.56 ≤6 → allowed.

So all of these are allowed except for b and t (but t is way too heavy).

So the possible decay channels are into the following fermion pairs:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B matches this exactly. It includes all these except b and t.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( m_X \geq 2m_f \)). The interaction term provided indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion pairs proportional to the Lagrangian.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Threshold**: The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the maximum mass of a fermion it can decay into is \( m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Any fermion with a mass greater than 3 GeV cannot be produced.

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Quarks**: 
     - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
     - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

3. **Allowed Decays**:
   - \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Option B**: Matches the allowed decays (\( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \)).
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
