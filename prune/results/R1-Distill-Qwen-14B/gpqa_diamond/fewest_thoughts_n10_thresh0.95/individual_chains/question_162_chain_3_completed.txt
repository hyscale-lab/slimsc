Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric in some coordinates. So the line element is in terms of dx and dy, but the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, right, maybe this is a metric in polar coordinates? Because x² + y² often appears as r² in polar. So maybe r² = x² + y².

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid or something. Oh wait, in the context of metrics, maybe it's a surface with negative Gaussian curvature.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere—I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere with radius r is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere (which I think is a model of hyperbolic space), the area might be different. Or maybe it's similar but uses a different formula.

Wait, but the metric given is in 2D, so perhaps it's a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, or perhaps it's a 2-dimensional spacetime? Hmm, but area in 2D would be like the area of a surface.

Wait, the metric form is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² is x² + y². Wait, because dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r²² dθ², but no, wait, x and y are Cartesian, so to polar it's dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So, substituting, the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So this is a 2-dimensional metric with line element depending on r. Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but wait, wait—radius in this context: in the metric, the denominator is 4 - r². So when r² approaches 4, the metric blows up, which suggests that r can't be bigger than 2. So r=2 is the maximum possible, beyond which the metric becomes singular.

Wait, but pseudosphere radius r=2. So if we set r=2, then the denominator 4 - (2)^2 = 4-4=0. So the metric becomes singular there. So the area near r=2 would be problematic. But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps it's a trick.

Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature. So the Gaussian curvature K is negative. For a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is related to the coefficients of the metric. Let me think about the formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric.

In 2D, if the metric is ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), then the Gaussian curvature K is given by -g''(r)/(2g(r)) + [g'(r)/(2g(r))]² / (2) or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a metric ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/f(r), the Gaussian curvature is proportional to the derivative of ln(f(r)) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Let me try.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in polar coordinates can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 r²)) [ d/dr (g_rr) + (g_rr g_θθ)/(r²) ( (1/(g_θθ)) * d/dr (g_θθ) ) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, the formula might be:

K = - (1/(2 r²)) [ (g_rr)'' + (g_rr)/(r²) + (g_θθ)/(r^4) ) ] 

Wait, perhaps another approach. Another formula I remember is:

The Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2√(det g))) * ∂/∂r (√(det g) * g^rr ) 

Wait, the determinant of the metric in 2D is det g = g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2. In our case, the metric is diagonal, so g_rθ = 0. Thus, det g = g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt(det g) = (32 r) / (4 - r²).

Now, the formula for K is:

K = - (1/(2 r²)) * d/dr ( sqrt(g) * g^rr )

Wait, g^rr is 1/g_rr, which is (4 - r²)/32.

So sqrt(g) is (32 r)/(4 - r²).

So, to compute K, we have:

K = - (1/(2 r²)) * d/dr [ sqrt(g) * g^rr ]

Substituting:

sqrt(g) * g^rr = [32 r/(4 - r²)] * [ (4 - r²)/32 ] = r.

Because the (4 - r²) and 32 terms cancel out. So sqrt(g)*g^rr = r.

Then, the derivative with respect to r is d/dr (r) = 1.

Thus,

K = - (1/(2 r²)) * 1 = -1/(2 r²).

Wait, but that's the Gaussian curvature. So K = -1/(2 r²).

Hmm, but a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So if K is a function of r, that suggests that this metric isn't a pseudosphere, unless K is constant. Wait, but in our case, K is -1/(2 r²), which depends on r. So perhaps this isn't a pseudosphere, but a surface with varying curvature.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe I should check if r=2 is a special case here.

Wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator in the metric goes to zero, which means the metric becomes singular there. So a pseudosphere might have a maximum radius beyond which it can't extend. But wait, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, but perhaps in this case, the metric only allows up to r=2 before it breaks down.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. So perhaps I can compute the area by integrating the area element over the surface, up to radius 2.

The area element in polar coordinates for this metric would be sqrt(det g) * r dr dθ. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ? Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is dA = sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Because in polar coordinates, the standard area element is r dr dθ, but here, the metric modifies that.

Wait, in this case, the metric is ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ². So the area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. Which is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. So det g is (32^2 r²)/( (4 - r²)^2 ). So sqrt(det g) is (32 r) / (4 - r²).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate this from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from 0 to 2π dθ ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * ∫ (-du/2) / u.

Which is -32 * (1/2) ∫ du/u = -16 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ln|u| + C.

So substituting back, u = 4 - r². So the integral becomes -16 ln|4 - r²| + C.

Now, evaluate from 0 to 2:

At r=2: -16 ln(0) → since 4 - (2)^2 = 0, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 (-infty) → positive infinity.

At r=0: -16 ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ] → infinity + 16 ln(4). Which is infinity.

So the area A is 2π * (infinite) = infinity.

Wait, but the options given include D) +infty. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but why is that? The pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so perhaps its area is infinite. Oh, because as you go to higher r, the metric allows for a larger and larger area.

Wait, but the question specifies radius r=2. Hmm, but in our metric, r can't go beyond 2 because the denominator becomes zero. So the surface is cut off at r=2, which is the edge. So the area up to r=2 is finite? Wait, but the integral from 0 to 2 is divergent. So the area is infinite.

Hmm, but that seems a bit odd because usually the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, but perhaps in this model, the radius is limited, making the area infinite. Alternatively, the area could be finite if the integral converges, but in our case, it's divergent.

So looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

Wait, wait, but why is the area infinite? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes large. So integrating up to r=2 would indeed give an infinite area.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

In polar coordinates (\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\)), this becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The problem asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area, we use the area element in polar coordinates for this metric:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}\). Thus:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \ln|u| + C.
\]

Substituting back \(u = 4 - r^2\), the integral evaluates to:

\[
-16 \ln|4 - r^2| \Big|_0^2.
\]

At \(r = 2\), \(4 - r^2 = 0\), so \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), making the term \(-16 \ln(0)\) diverge to \(+\infty\). At \(r = 0\), the term is finite. Thus, the radial integral diverges to \(+\infty\).

The total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This divergence occurs because the metric becomes singular at \(r = 2\), and the area element grows without bound as \(r\) approaches 2. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
