Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I think I need to figure out the relative speed between them. Oh wait, in relativity, velocities don't just subtract like in classical mechanics. Right, you can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c because that would be 0.1c, but that's not how it works at high speeds. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity.

The formula for the relative velocity v_rel when two objects are moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, I think that's when they're moving towards each other. Or is it the other way around? Wait, both are moving in the same direction here. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. The relative speed of 1 with respect to 2 would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, let me check that. So if u is the velocity of object A relative to the lab frame, and v is the velocity of object B relative to the lab, then the velocity of A as seen from B's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, that makes sense.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Plugging in, numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that: (0.3c²)/(c²) = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... So about 0.14c. Hmm, that's around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that leaves B and C as possibilities for the relative speed part, but let's check the energy.

Next part, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is a relativistic mass, their energies would be their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma (the Lorentz factor).

The rest energy is mc². So for the first astronaut (mass 2m), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) because beta is 0.6. Let's compute this. (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy is 2m * c² * gamma. Wait, no, wait: the energy is gamma multiplied by m, not 2m? Wait, no, no. Each astronaut's mass is 2m and 3m, right? So energy for astronaut 1 is gamma1 * (2m) c², and astronaut 2 is gamma2 * (3m) c².

Wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. Each astronaut's rest mass is 2m and 3m. So each's energy is their rest mass times gamma.

So for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².
Astronaut 2: E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

So let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Gamma for 0.6c: beta is 0.6, so beta squared is 0.36. 1 - beta squared is 0.64. sqrt is 0.8. Gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Gamma for 0.5c: beta is 0.5, beta squared is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. Let me be precise: sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, so 1/(sqrt(3)/2) is 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c². 1.1547 * 3 is approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5mc².

So the energy part would match option C and option B. Wait, no. Let's look at all options.

Option B: v_rel = 0.1c, E=4.96 mc². No, our v_rel is 0.14c.

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. That matches our calculation.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2. The energy isn't 5, it's about 5.96.

So looking at the options, option C seems to fit both the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations just to be sure.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1.25. 2m * 1.25 = 2.5m. So E1 is 2.5m c².

Gamma for 0.5c: 1.154
