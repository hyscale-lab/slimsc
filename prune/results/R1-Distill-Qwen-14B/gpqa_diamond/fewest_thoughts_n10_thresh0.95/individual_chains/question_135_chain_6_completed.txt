Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, that might be a typo in my head. Let me parse that again. The structure looks like it's proportional to the product of fermion fields and X. So, the interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Or is it the Yukawa coupling kind of structure?

Wait, the Yukawa interaction usually looks like g ψ ψ X, right? So maybe in this case, the interaction is a term involving ψ_f, X, and another fermion, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a mass term, but given that X is a boson, it's more likely that X is a scalar (since it's bosonic), so the interaction would allow X to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the coupling is between X and fermions, which means that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays would be X → f f̄, where f is any of the fermions that are coupled.

But wait, what determines which fermions X can couple to? The Lagrangian must have terms that couple X to specific fermions. So looking at the interaction term, the term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I'm misreading it. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is something like ψ_f ψ_f X, meaning that the coupling is to a fermion-antifermion pair, so X would decay into two fermions.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that X couples to a fermion pair. So the decay would be X → ψ_f ψ_f̄.

But wait, what kind of fermions are allowed here? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps from the Lagrangian we can infer which fermions are involved.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, but that would imply a Yukawa coupling term.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as -λ X ψ_f ψ_f. So that would imply that X can couple to a pair of the same fermion. So, for each fermion f, X can decay into two f's.

But wait, fermions are particles and antiparticles, so X → f and f̄? Or wait, no, each ψ_f is a field, which could represent a particle or antiparticle depending on the mode. So the term would imply that X couples to a pair of fermions ψ_f and ψ_f, but that would create a fermion-antifermion pair when X decays.

Wait, but the fermions come in different flavors. So for example, if X is an SU(2) Higgs, it would couple to all the fermions, but perhaps in this case, X is a specific boson that couples to certain fermions.

Wait, but the problem states the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so the coupling is to fermions ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that ψ_f represents.

But wait, what fermions are present? The options include quarks and leptons. So, for example, if ψ_f includes up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top quarks, and all the leptons (e, mu, tau), then X can decay into any of them.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV, because the maximum possible mass of each particle in the pair would be (m_X)/2, assuming they are the same mass. But wait, if the particles are different, that's a different story, but in the case of fermion-antifermion pairs, they are the same mass (since they're each other's antiparticles).

Wait, but for example, the top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way higher than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into top quarks. Similarly, the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, 4.5 is more than 3, so X can't decay into b quarks either.

Similarly, the tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV. So each tau would be about 1.77, which is less than 3 GeV, so that's okay.

So, the possible fermions that can be decay products are those with mass less than 3 GeV.

Which fermions have masses under 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses (approximate):

Up quark: ~2 MeV (much less)
Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
Strange quark: ~100 MeV (but some sources say 100 MeV, others up to 200 MeV)
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (so too heavy)
Top quark: way too heavy.

Leptons:
Electron: ~0.5 MeV
Muon: ~105 MeV
Tau: ~1.77 GeV
Neutrinos: negligible (<<1 MeV)

Wait, but wait. The decay X → f f̄. So the invariant mass of each f must be less than m_X / 2.

So m_X is 6 GeV, so each f must have mass < 3 GeV.

So, looking at each fermion:

- Up quark: 2 MeV < 3 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark: ~5 MeV → allowed.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV → allowed.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → allowed (1.5 <3).
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV → not allowed since 4.5>3.
- Top quark: too heavy, not allowed.

Leptons:

- Electron: 0.5 MeV → allowed.
- Muon: ~105 MeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV → allowed.
- Neutrinos: allowed, but since they are massless in many models, but their presence may not contribute to the decay kinematics. But the problem likely considers only massive fermions.

So the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Wait, but wait: the problem options include combinations like b bbar and others. But from our analysis, b and t are too heavy, so X cannot decay into them, so any decay option including b or t would be invalid.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, so each b would require 4.5 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. 4.5 + 4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV. So decay into b and bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Each of these: c is 1.5 GeV, so each c is 1.5, 1.5*2=3 <6. So yes, allowed. s is 100 MeV, u and d are even lighter. Tau is 1.77, so 2*1.77=3.54 <6? Wait, no, 2*1.77 is 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So yes.

Wait, but wait: 6 GeV is the mass of X. So the maximum allowed is that each fermion is less than 3 GeV. So yes, c is okay. So option B includes c, which is allowed. But option B doesn't include top quark, which is correct.

Wait, but in the options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all of them have mass less than 3 GeV except maybe the charm quark. Wait, 1.5 GeV is less than 3. So yes, all are allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? It's not in any option except option C, which is incorrect because top is way too heavy. So, correct.

Another check: option B includes c cbar. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 <6, so X can decay into c cbar.

But wait, what about the tau lepton? 2*1.77=3.54 GeV <6 GeV, so allowed.

So option B seems possible.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

But t is way too heavy, so this option is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian. The way the Lagrangian is written may restrict which fermions can be decay products. Let me check.

The given Lagrangian is:

L(y) = -lambda f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's meant to be the Yukawa term, like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that X couples to a pair of fermions ψ_f.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. The interaction term would be something like X ψ ψ, so when X decays, it would produce a fermion and an antifermion.

So for each fermion ψ that X couples to, X can decay into ψ and ψ̄.

So, the term in the Lagrangian is such that for each fermion f, X couples to f and f̄.

Therefore, the possible decay products are any f and f̄ such that the sum of their masses is less than or equal to m_X.

So, all the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV can be decay products.

So, the fermions allowed would be e, mu, tau (leptons), u, d, s, c (quarks), but not b or t.

Wait, but the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. So regardless of the interaction, the mass of X must be >= twice the mass of each fermion.

So which of the options includes only the allowed fermions.

Looking again at the options.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

All of these are allowed because their masses are under 3 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but what about the interaction term? Because the term in the Lagrangian could restrict which fermions are coupled.

The question says the interaction is given by that term. So for each fermion f, the term is present, so X can decay into any of them.

But wait, the fermions are labeled as ψ_f, so perhaps f is each of the fermion types, so the interaction includes all possible fermions. So X can decay into any of the fermion-antifermion pairs that are allowed kinematically.

So the possible decay products are any fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV.

Thus, the correct answer is option B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

The other options include either b or t, which are too heavy, so they are incorrect.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

The interaction term implies that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, allowing \( X \) to decay into \( f \bar{f} \), where \( f \) represents any fermion. However, the decay is kinematically allowed only if the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). For \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay must have a mass less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 4.5 > 3 \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 173 \gg 3 \)).
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

From this analysis, the allowed fermions for \( X \)-boson decays are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Decays involving \( b \) or \( t \) quarks are kinematically forbidden due to their masses exceeding \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are given in **Option B**.

Answer: B
