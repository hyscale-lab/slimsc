Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax^5) or N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That means if distance increases, parallax decreases.

So, if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d gives N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think again. Because 1/plx^5 is the same as (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if I have a certain range of distance, say from r to r + dr, how does the number of stars in that shell depend on r?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be the derivative of N with respect to r multiplied by dr, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, considering integrating over the volume. The number of stars is a function of distance, so perhaps it's better to express N as a function of distance and then find how the density or the count per unit distance behaves.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So the number of stars in a region is inversely proportional to plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that's the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the rate at which the number of stars increases as we move away. That is, dN/dr, the derivative.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. Because if you have N = k * d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number per unit distance (like in a shell) would go as r^4.

Wait, but is the question about the number in a unit range of r? So perhaps the question is about the number of stars in each unit distance interval, like dN/dr, which is the change in N as r changes by a small amount. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr ∝ d^4, so the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~r^4.

But wait, let me double-check. Is this the correct approach? Because sometimes when you have N proportional to d^5, the number per unit volume would be different, but in this case, it's the number per unit distance.

Wait, another approach: think of the relationship between parallax and distance. Plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So the number of stars N is proportional to (d)^5.

Now, if I have a range of distances from r to r + dr, how does the number of stars in that range depend on r?

Alternatively, I can think of the number of stars as a function of distance. Suppose the number of stars in a small range dr around r is proportional to r^5 dr. But wait, that would mean the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^5. But that's not matching what I thought earlier.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

Given: N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So the number of stars in a thin shell (infinitesimal thickness dr) at distance r would be (dN/dr) dr. So dN/dr is the number per unit distance. So dN/dr = (d/d(r)) [k r^5] = 5k r^4.

So per unit distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^4. So when the question asks how the number of stars in that region changes with distance (per unit range), the answer would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but another thought: if N is proportional to d^5, then as you go further out, the number of stars increases rapidly. But that doesn't make sense, because usually, the number of stars thins out as you go further. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The number of stars observed is higher when the parallax is smaller. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if parallax decreases, distance increases.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So higher parallax (closer stars) would mean more stars. So when parallax is higher (smaller distance), the number of stars is higher.

So for example, in the solar neighborhood (small plx), you have more stars. As you go further away (larger plx), the number of stars you can see decreases.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, N ∝ 1/plx^5. So when plx decreases (distance increases), N increases. That would suggest that the number of stars increases with distance, which seems counterintuitive because I would expect the opposite.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-examine it.

The question says, "...the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = k*(1/plx^5) → N =k d^5. So when d increases (we look further away), N increases. That would mean more stars are seen at larger distances, which doesn't make sense because stars are spread out more, so we should see fewer. So perhaps I have it the wrong way.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the number of stars per unit volume increases with distance, but that's another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula given is correct regardless of intuition, so I should proceed with the mathematics.

So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

But that would mean that as d increases, N increases, which would suggest that closer regions have fewer stars. That doesn't align with reality, but perhaps the question is hypothetical.

So, accepting that N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So the number of stars in a region (per unit distance) increases as r^4. Therefore, the correct option is C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, meaning dN/dr.

So if N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4, so the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance according to this specific proportionality.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate at which the number of stars changes per unit distance. Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). This matches option C. While the result may seem counterintuitive (since the number of stars typically decreases with distance in reality), the question assumes the given proportionality \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), and the mathematics follows directly from this assumption.

Answer: C
