Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups.

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data provided. The IR shows strong peaks. The important ones are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carbonyl or an ester. Wait, no, more likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O). Could that be an ester or a ketone? But wait, 1720 is more typical for an ester or a ketone. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have a lower C=O around 1700, but if it's an acid, the broad O-H around 3000 would make sense. But looking at the NMR might help clarify.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in an acid, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So that suggests that the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let's double-check. The IR also has 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which could be indicative of aromatic rings. So, the compound probably has a benzene ring. So, the structure is likely a substituted benzoic acid.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: 1H, broad singlet → -COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So, if it's para, the two protons would be equivalent and show as a doublet, maybe adjacent to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, maybe the other two in the para arrangement. So, perhaps the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but the compound is benzoic acid, so the -COOH is in one position, and another group is in the para position.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring would determine the NMR shifts. Let me think. Benzoic acid has the -COOH in the para position relative to another substituent. Or perhaps it's ortho, but para is more common.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Hmm, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. Maybe a ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl adjacent to another CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but 1.4 ppm is a bit high for a CH3 adjacent to a CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution.

Wait, looking at the integrals: 1H, 2H, 3H, 3H. So, the 1H at 2.9 is a methine (CH) group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two protons on CH2. So, perhaps a chain like CH2CH2CH(CH3) or something.

Putting this together, the benzoic acid has a substituent on the benzene ring that is a isopropyl group or something similar. Wait, let's think about the structure.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which suggests a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. Because a triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. So, if the CH2 is next to the CH, which is adjacent to the CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet. So, structure-wise, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Wait, maybe a butyl group.

Wait, let me try to draw this. The benzoic acid has a substituent on the ring. Let's say the substituent is a group attached via a chain. The chain is something like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, the NMR appears to have a 1H at 2.9, which is a CH. So maybe it's a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, let's think in terms of splitting. The triplet in the CH3 suggests it's adjacent to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to the CH and the CH2 connected to the ring. So perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)- group? Or maybe a branching point.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a CH connected to two CH2 groups. Let me think:

The substituent would be attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be something like benzene with a COOH group and a substituent. Let me model the substituent:

Assuming the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, let's clarify: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's not quite right. Wait, butyl groups are four carbons. So, the substituent would be a butyl group attached via the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that would be a branching point. Alternatively, the substituent could be a pentyl group, but no, the NMR suggests shorter chains.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the benzene ring has a substituent that is a three-carbon chain. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet for the CH3, which is in a CH2CH2 group.

Let me try to figure out the structure.

The 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, COOH)
- 8.0 (d, 2H): Maybe the two protons adjacent to the substituent on the ring.
- 7.2 (d, 2H): The other two protons in the para position.

So, the benzene ring is likely para-substituted with two groups: one is the COOH, and the other is a substituent. Wait, but in benzene rings, if there are two substituents, their positions matter. But in this case, the substituents would be at the para positions, making the two sets of protons as doublets.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (like -COOH and another group), how would that look? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that itself has branching, causing the NMR shifts.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me think about the integration and splitting.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. It's a four-carbon chain? Or three?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. That would make it a pentyl group, but wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a CH3 group attached to a CH. If that's the case, then the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group. But where's the rest?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the chain is three carbons, with the CH(CH3) at the end.

Wait, let me try to assign each NMR signal.

- 10.5 ppm: COOH proton.
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: benzene ring protons. Let's say positions 2 and 6 (if 4 is COOH), but I'm a bit confused about the substitution pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, making the ring have two substituents: one at position 1 (COOH) and another at position 4 (some group). Or perhaps the substituent is a single group, and the ring has symmetry.

Wait, the aromatic protons are a doublet at 8.0 and another at 7.2. That suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. If the substituent is in the para position to the COOH group, then the ring would have two doublets. Let's say the substituent is at position 4, and COOH is at position 1. Then, the H at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, appearing as a doublet around 8.0 ppm, and the H at positions 3 and 5 would be another doublet around 7.2 ppm. So that fits with the NMR.

So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4.

Now, the substituent at position 4 must be a group that gives the other NMR signals. Let's look at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a methine (CH) group, probably adjacent to two sets of protons.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group, possibly next to a CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH3.

So, putting this together, the substituent is a chain: the benzene at position 4 is attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the CH2 would be next to the CH.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps it's an iso-butyl group. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me recall: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached via the second carbon, i.e., -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the substituent's structure must provide the NMR signals as follows:

The CH3 at 0.9 ppm is a terminal, so it's attached to a CH2. That CH2 would be next to another CH2, which is attached to a CH. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But wait, the CH(CH3) would have a neighboring CH2, so the CH would have two neighboring groups. Let me think: the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH3. So, the substituent is a pentyl group? Or butyl?

Wait, wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Let me count the carbons. Benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- would be a four-carbon substituent. Oh, wait, no, that's three carbons after the benzene. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a group with a chain and a branching. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a methine (CH), so perhaps it's connected to two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (2H) is a CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH. The 0.9 (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to the CH2.

Putting it all together, the substituent is: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make the substituent -(CH2)2CH(CH3)2? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how the substituent would look.

The substituent attached to the benzene is a chain like:

Benzene - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, that can't be because the CH(CH3) would be attached to two CH2 groups. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group, but that might not fit with the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

Benzene - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH3.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, let's think about the integrals. The substituent has 1H (CH), 2H (CH2), 3H (CH3), and 3H (CH3). So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that gives more protons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a neighboring CH2 and another substituent.

Wait, but in that case, the CH2 would be next to the CH, and the other end of the CH2 would be attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that would only be two carbons. Not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. That would be a three-carbon substituent. Let me check.

So, benzene ring attached to CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a neighboring CH2 and a CH2CH3. The CH2 (attached to the benzene) would have another CH2 and the benzene.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene: would that be the 1.7 ppm (m,2H). The CH(CH2CH3) would be the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), and the
