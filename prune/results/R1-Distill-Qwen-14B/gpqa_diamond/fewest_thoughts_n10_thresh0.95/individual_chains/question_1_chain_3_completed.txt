Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A through D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Specifically, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the precision of energy measurement to the time over which the energy is measured. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt or something like that. I should probably double-check the exact formula. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2. But for this problem, I think it's sufficient to use ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt as an order of magnitude estimate.

So, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the quantum states. I think the lifetime here refers to the time during which the state exists before decaying, or the time it takes for the state to change. The uncertainty in time, Δt, would then be related to this lifetime. Maybe Δt is roughly the lifetime itself? Or perhaps it's on the order of the lifetime. For the purposes of this problem, I'll assume Δt is similar to the lifetime given.

Wait, but both states have different lifetimes. So I need to calculate the energy uncertainty for each and then determine the minimum energy difference required for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. The two states have different energies, and we need their energy difference to be larger than the uncertainty so that they can be resolved as separate peaks or distinguishable signals.

Right, so the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy measurements for each state. Or wait, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum or some combination of their uncertainties?

Wait, no. I think each state has its own uncertainty in energy based on its own lifetime. For example, the first state (E1) has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, so its energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, the second state (E2) has τ2 = 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, wait a minute. The energy uncertainty for each state would be based on the measurement time. But since the states have different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties are different.

But the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So how does that tie in? Well, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between them (ΔE = E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their energy distributions, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Each state has an energy with an uncertainty. For the first state, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. For the second, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2. So the uncertainty in E1 is larger if the lifetime is shorter because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ. So E1 has a larger uncertainty (since τ1 is smaller) than E2.

Wait, because τ1 is 1e-9 and τ2 is 1e-8. So τ1 is smaller, so ΔE1 would be bigger. For example, ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) and ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8). So ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2.

Wait, so if E2 and E1 are two states with their own uncertainties, the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if it's smaller, their energy intervals would overlap, making them hard to distinguish. So Δ(E2 - E1) must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, I'm not sure if it's the sum or the individual uncertainties. Let me think. The energy resolution required is such that the peaks don't overlap. So the separation between the peaks should be more than the sum of their half-widths. Because each peak has a certain width (like the uncertainty), so the separation should be more than the sum of the half-widths. Wait, each peak's half-width is approximately the uncertainty. So the separation should be more than twice the average of the uncertainties? Or more than the sum of each's uncertainty?

Hmm. Let me think in terms of the lines in a spectrum. Suppose you have two lines with line widths (full width at half maximum) of w1 and w2. To resolve them, the separation between their centers should be greater than (w1 + w2)/2. Wait, or maybe greater than (w1 + w2)/something. I think it's the Rayleigh criterion for resolution in spectroscopy: the angular separation needs to be such that the distance between the peaks is at least equal to their combined width or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps in terms of energy, the condition for resolving two energy levels is that the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute that. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec.

So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, but energy is in eV in the options. So I'll need to convert from Joules to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ħ/(τ1) = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6, so 1e-6 times 1.05457 ≈ 1.05e-6 J. Wait, wait no. Wait, sorry, 1.0545718e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1.0545718e-25 J. Then, divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV to get eV: 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.05457e-25)/(1.602e-19) = approx 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approx 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So the sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if it's a sum or perhaps the maximum uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum uncertainty of either state. Hmm, but the initial statement is that we want to distinguish the two energy levels. So perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the individual uncertainties. Or maybe just the larger of the two.

Wait, if the energy difference is larger than both individual uncertainties, then it's definitely resolvable. Because each state's energy is within ±ΔE of the mean. So the separation between the two states must be more than the sum of their uncertainties to avoid overlap.

Wait, let's think: If E1 is at energy E, with uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 is at E + ΔE, with uncertainty ΔE2. The two intervals would be [E-ΔE1, E+ΔE1] and [E+ΔE -ΔE2, E+ΔE +ΔE2]. To prevent overlap, E+ΔE - ΔE2 must be greater than E + ΔE1. So that E + ΔE - ΔE2 > E + ΔE1 → ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. So yes, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, in our case, the sum is approximately 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = let's calculate that.

6.58e-7 is 0.658e-6, and 6.58e-8 is 0.0658e-6. Adding these gives 0.7238e-6 eV, or 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV. Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-6 eV. Even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.1e-3 eV, which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.238e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 times bigger than 7.238e-7. So option C is way larger than needed.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV. Which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6 eV, which is about 0.01e-6 compared to 0.7238e-6. So 0.01 is less than 0.7238. So it's not enough. So the energy difference must be larger than 7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is above that. Wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. But is there any option that is larger than 7.2e-7 eV? Let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 0.001e-6 < 0.7238e-6 → No.

Option B: 1e-11 → 0.00001e-6 → No.

Option C: 1e-4 → 0.1e-3 → 0.1e-3 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 0.1e-3, which is way bigger than 7e-7, which is 7e-7.

Option D: 1e-8 → 0.01e-6 → 0.01e-6 < 0.7238e-6 → No.

So the only option that is larger than 7e-7 eV is option C. So the correct answer is C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \Delta t \), where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. 

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \text{or } \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \text{or } \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty for resolving the two states is the sum of their individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficiently large.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Too small.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.

Answer: C
