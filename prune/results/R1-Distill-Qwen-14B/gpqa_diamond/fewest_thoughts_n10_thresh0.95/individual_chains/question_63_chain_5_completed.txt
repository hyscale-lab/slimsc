Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is different from the rigid rotor because it allows for bond stretching, so the rotational energy levels aren't quantized as in the rigid case. But wait, wait, the question is about the fundamental state and moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so I need to think about the energy transitions here.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But what's the next state? Since it's a diatomic molecule, its energy comes from both rotational and vibrational movements. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which for the non-rigid rotor model probably combines the lowest vibrational and rotational states. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model, but for rotation, the ground is usually J=0, but wait, in the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0, but the non-rigid might have different considerations... Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model is more about the bond length changing, but for the energy levels, it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are given by E = E_rot + E_vib. 

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But in the non-rigid rotor, I think the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy may have a different form. But maybe for this problem, they're treating it as a rigid rotor for the rotational part because the problem gives bond length R as a constant. Or perhaps not; perhaps the non-rigid aspect affects the rotational energy. Well, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The problem is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. So what's the next state? Since the fundamental state is the lowest, the next state could be either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1, assuming J starts at 0). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

Wait, the options given are all momentum values, not energies. So I need to find the momentum of the photon, which relates to its energy via E=pc (since for photons, E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light). So I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then find the momentum of the photon that corresponds to that energy.

But first, I need to figure out whether the transition is rotational, vibrational, or a combination. Because for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of both. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational are quantized as well.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be either increasing J by 1 (so J=1) or increasing v by 1 (v=1). So which transition requires higher energy? The energy for vibrational transitions is usually higher than rotational because the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely. Wait, no, actually, that depends on the constants. Let me think: the vibrational energy spacing is given by the vibrational frequency, which is typically much higher than rotational spacing. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition would be higher than for a rotational one.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both. Let me think about how the energy levels are structured. In the rigid rotor-vibrator model, the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot. So each rotational state within a vibrational state has its own energy.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next energy level up could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has a lower energy?

The vibrational energy for v=1 is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (since for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. Wait, no, wait: for the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w (full quantum). For the rotational part, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For J=0, E_rot is zero. For J=1, E_rot = B * 2. So the energy difference for a rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) is 2 B. So which is larger: h w or 2 B?

Given the problem's parameters, let's compute both.

Given w (angular frequency) is 4e14 rad/s. So h w is Planck's constant times angular frequency, which is the energy of a photon with frequency w. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon would cause the smallest possible energy jump. So we need to find the transition with the lowest energy difference.

So compute both possible transitions:

1. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0): delta E = h w (since E_vib goes from (0 + 1/2)hw to (1 + 1/2)hw, so delta E is hw).

2. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1): delta E = 2 B.

So which is smaller? Let's compute B.

B is the rotational constant, which is given by B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), but wait, no. Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as B = (h)/(8 pi^2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is mu * R^2, where mu is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

Let me compute the reduced mass mu. The masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So mu = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) )= (20 *2)/(22) amu. 40/22 = ~1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So mu = 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = mu R^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, B = h/(8 pi² I). But wait, wait, I think B is actually (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I k), but no, wait. Let me think again. Rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (h)/(8 pi^2 I c) ), but wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the rotational constant B has units of cm^-1 when expressed in terms of wavenumbers. But in terms of energy in joules, I think the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) * J (J+1), but wait, that's the same as B J (J+1), where B is (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) per J.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy. So E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

Let me compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

I is 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So denominator 8 pi² I is 8 * (9.8696) * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.87 * 1.207e-46.

Compute 8 *9.87≈78.96. So 78.96 *1.207e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So numerator h² is 4.39e-67.

So B = h²/(8 pi² I) = (4.39e-67) / (9.53e-45) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So when J increases from 0 to 1, delta E_rot = 2 * 4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier I had h w as 2.65e-19 J. So 2.65e-19 J is much larger than 9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. Therefore, the photon would have to have an energy matching the rotational transition, which is smaller.

Wait, but in the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So to switch to the next state, which is the next lowest energy, it must be the next rotational state (J=1), because the energy required is lower than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B.

Wait, but wait: in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are different. No, wait, non-rigid rotor is about allowing bond length variation, which affects the rotational energy. But for this problem, I think they're treating it as a rigid rotor because they gave a fixed bond length R. So I can proceed with the rigid rotor model for the rotational part.

So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition delta E = 2B. So E_photon = 2B.

But wait, no. Because in the rigid rotor, the energy levels increase with J. So from J=0 to J=1, the energy is 2B, as E_rot goes from 0 to 2B.

So the photon's energy must be 2B.

Wait, but wait, in the rigid rotor, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot = B *1*2 = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B.

But wait, what about the vibrational energy? For the vibration, the energy difference is h w. So which one is smaller? As I calculated before, h w is about 2.65e-19 J, and 2B is about 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the rotational part. But the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. So when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state. So the photon's energy is delta E = 2B.

But wait, the problem says to find the photon's momentum. Since the energy of the photon is E = pc, then p = E/(c).

So let's compute p.

E = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but that's a very small momentum.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them are in the order of 1e-27 or 1e-28 N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s, so the units are the same.

Wait, but my calculation gives p≈3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s. But none of the options are that small. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 4e-23 kg·m/s. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me go back.

Wait, B is the rotational constant in energy terms? Or in terms of wavenumbers?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Because in spectroscopy, the rotational constant B is often expressed in cm⁻¹, which is energy per photon (E=hcB). So maybe I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers, then convert to energy.

Wait, let me re-define B correctly. The rotational constant in terms of energy is B = (h²)/(8 pi² I c), where c is the speed of light. Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B has units of energy. Alternatively, sometimes B is given in terms of wavenumbers, which are inverse centimeters, so E_rot = hc B J (J+1). That's another way to express it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using the formula B = (h²)/(8 pi² I c). Let me try that.

So I is the moment of inertia, which I computed as 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi² * 1.207e-46 * 3e8).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 43.9 * 1e-68 = 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 * pi² * I * c = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.207e-46 * 3e8.

Calculate each part:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply by 1.207e-46: 78.9568 *1.207e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

Multiply by 3e8: 9.53e-45 *3e8 = 2.859e-36.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 2.859e-36 = approx (4.39 / 2.859 )e-31 = 1.536e-31 J.

Wait, that's B as the energy. So E_rot = B J (J+1).

From J=0 to J=1, delta E = 2B = 3.07e-31 J.

Then p = E/c = 3.07e-31 /3e8 = 1.02e-39 N·s. That's way smaller than the options given. What's wrong here?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is correct. Reduced mass mu is (20 *2)/(22) amu. So 40/22 = 18.18...? Wait, no, 20 and 2, so mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) )=40/22=18.18... amu. Wait, 20 amu is X, and 2 amu is Y. So mu is 40/(22) = 1.818... amu. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. So I = mu R^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is different. Let me check online. Oh wait, no, I can't do that right now. But I think I might have confused B with another term. Another way: the rotational energy is E = (h²)/(8 pi² I) * J (J+1). So B here is (h²)/(8 pi² I), which is about (4.39e-67) / (8 pi² * 1.207e-46 kg m²). Let me compute that.

Wait, denominator is 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.207e-46. Pi^2 is about 9.87. So 8 *9.87 = 78.98, multiplied by I=1.207e-46 gives 78.98 *1.207e-46 = approx 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45 kg m².

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Ah, so B is 4.6e-23 J. So delta E from J=0 to J=1 is 2B=9.2e-23 J. So p = E_photon /c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s. But none of the options are this small. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should be considering the vibrational transition. Because perhaps in the rotation-vibration coupling, the first excited state could be a combination of rotation and vibration. Or maybe the model allows for simultaneous transitions in both. Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the next available state. So it's either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Previously, the energy for rotational transition is much smaller than vibrational. So why are the options so much larger than my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require a photon of energy h w. Let me compute that.

h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J. Then p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, A is 1.9e-28, etc. So 8.8e-28 isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option A: 1.9e-28, but that's about half.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the model requires the photon to have enough energy to promote the molecule to both a higher rotational and vibrational state. But that would require more energy, which would make the photon's momentum larger than the options. Or perhaps the problem is more about the vibrational transition, but I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the Raman active transitions, which involve simultaneous changes in J and V. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational coupling, which could involve simultaneous changes. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the calculation. Let me recheck the B calculation.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is (h²)/(8 pi² I). So for J=1, E_rot is 2B. So delta E is 2B. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. So perhaps I should compute B differently. Let me think about the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, another formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (h c B_rot) J (J+1), where B_rot is in cm⁻¹. But perhaps I should compute B_rot using the formula B_rot = (h)/(8 pi² I c).

Wait, let's compute B_rot in cm⁻¹.

I = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

c = 3e8 m/s.

So B_rot = h/(8 pi² I c) = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.207e-46 *3e8 )

Compute denominator: 8 pi² I c =8 *9.8696 *1.207e-46 *3e8.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.207e-46 = approx 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

9.53e-45 *3e8 = 2.859e-36.

So B_rot = 6.626e-34 / 2.859e-36 = approx 2316 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that can't be right. 2316 cm⁻¹ is about 23 THz, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which is about 6.38e13 Hz (since 4e14 rad/s is (4e14)/(2pi) Hz ≈6.37e13 Hz), which is in the infrared region.

Wait, but 2316 cm⁻¹ is about 23 THz, which is higher than the given w. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let's compute B_rot again.

Denominator: 8 pi² I c = 8 * (pi^2) * I * c.

pi² is about 9.8696.

8 *9.8696 = 78.9568.

Multiply by I (1.207e-46): 78.9568 *1.207e-46 = 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s): 9.53e-45 *3e8 = 2.859e-36.

So B_rot = 6.626e-34 / 2.859e-36 = (6.626 / 2.859) * 1e2 ≈ 2.316 *1e2 = 231.6 cm⁻¹.

Ah, right, I had a decimal error. So B_rot is 231.6 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but how does this help? Because if B_rot is 231.6 cm⁻¹, then the rotational energy per J is E = hc B_rot J (J+1).

So for J=1, E_rot = hc * 231.6 cm⁻¹ * 2 (since J=1: 1*(1+1)=2).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 *3e8 * 231.6 * 1e2 m⁻¹.

Wait, 231.6 cm⁻¹ is 2316 m⁻¹.

Wait, that's 231.6 *1e2 m⁻¹ =2.316e2 m⁻¹? No, no, 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm⁻¹ is 100 m⁻¹. So 231.6 cm⁻¹ is 23160 m⁻¹.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 m/s * 2.316e4 m⁻¹ * 2.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Multiply by 2.316e4 m⁻¹: 1.9878e-25 *2.316e4 = 4.6e-21 J.

Multiply by 2 (since J=1: 2B_rot J(J+1)=2*231.6 cm⁻¹ *2 = 926.4 cm⁻¹? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recompute:

E_rot for J=1 is hc * B_rot * J (J+1). So J=1: 1*2=2.

So E_rot = 6.626e-34 *3e8 * 231.6 *1e2 * 2.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

231.6 cm⁻¹ is 23160 m⁻¹.

So 1.9878e-25 J·m * 23160 m⁻¹ = 1.9878e-25 *2.316e4 = approx 4.6e-21 J.

Multiply by 2 (because J=1 gives 2*B_rot): 4.6e-21 *2=9.2e-21 J.

So delta E_rot =9.2e-21 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c =9.2e-21 /3e8=3.07e-29 kg·m/s =3.07e-29 N·s.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let's think differently.

Wait, maybe the model is considering the fundamental state as the first vibrational state. No, the fundamental state is the lowest, v=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider a transition where both vibrational and rotational levels change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. We have to choose the one with the smallest energy difference.

As earlier, the vibrational transition requires delta E = h w=2.65e-19 J.

The rotational transition requires delta E=9.2e-23 J.

Thus, the rotational transition requires a much lower energy photon, so that's the next state. So p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s=3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So my calculation is way off. I must have made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B. Let me try another approach. The rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), but perhaps it's (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: compute the moment of inertia I. I = mu R².

mu is the reduced mass. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) ) amu = 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So mu =1.81818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = mu R^2 =3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I).

So h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h^2=4.39e-67 J²·s².

So B=4.39e-67 / (8 pi² *1.208e-46)

8 pi² ≈78.96.

78.96 *1.208e-46 =95.3e-46=9.53e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 ≈4.6e-23 J.

So delta E=2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are way bigger than that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering a photon that provides both the energy for vibration and rotation. But the question states the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the vibration-rotation spectrum, which could have a different energy.

Wait, perhaps the fundamental state is the first state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0). But as I thought earlier, that requires delta E=hw=2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is option A is 1.9e-28, option B is 2.3e-27, etc. So 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated h w.

Wait, let me recompute h w.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c= 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this. Option D is 1.4e-28. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibration model, which could be a transition where both vibration and rotation change. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is not rigid, so the bond length changes, which affects the rotational energy. But I'm not sure how to model that without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy required to go from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1, but that would involve both transitions, which would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy of the photon as matching the vibrational energy, but then why is the rotational transition not considered.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, perhaps I should pick the answer based on the vibrational transition, which gives p≈8.8e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this; the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but that's about a fifth of my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the photon's momentum in the context of the molecule's mass and velocity.

Wait, another approach: the photon's momentum p is equal to its energy divided by c. So if the energy is h f = h w / (2 pi) ?

Wait, no, because w is angular frequency, so energy E = h w. Because E = h f, and f = w/(2 pi). So E = h w/(2 pi). So did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait, no. E_photon = h f, where f is frequency. But w=2 pi f, so f= w/(2 pi).

So E_photon = h (w/(2 pi)).

So in the rotational transition, E=2B, but in the vibrational transition, E = h w/(2 pi).

Wait, perhaps I did this wrong earlier. Let me compute E_vib using h w/(2 pi):

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi) = (2.65e-19) /6.283≈4.21e-19 J.

Then p=E/c=4.21e-19 /3e8≈1.403e-27 Ns. Oh, that's close to option B:2.3e-27, but not exactly. Or option C is 1.1e-27, or option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, 1.403e-27 is approximately 1.4e-27, which isn't any of the options. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Wait, 1.403e-27 is close to option B (2.3e-27) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, E_vib = (h w) / (2 pi). So let me compute that:

E_vib = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 *3.1416) = (2.65e-19) /6.283 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=4.21e-19 /3e8 =1.403e-27 kg·m/s = 1.403e-27 Ns.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, which is larger. Option C is 1.1e-27, which is smaller. Hmm.

But this doesn't match any option exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition.

Wait, for E_rot=2B=9.2e-23 J, p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's p without dividing by 2 pi.

Wait, earlier I thought E_photon = h w. So E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth of this. Hmm. So no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require more energy.

Wait, but that would be a higher energy state. The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so J=1 is the next.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the bond length in the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rigid rotor model but the non-rigid one, which allows for a different approach. But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have momentum corresponding to the vibrational energy, which would be option D (1.4e-28) or option A.

Wait, but my calculation for E_vib with h w/(2 pi) gave p≈1.4e-27, which is not in the options. But option D is 1.4e-28, which is an order of magnitude less.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given options are based on a different model, such as considering the molecule as a rigid rotor for vibration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy in terms of wavenumbers. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is E_rot = (1/2) I ω^2, but that's the classical expression and not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have enough energy to promote the molecule to the next vibrational state, which would require p ≈2.3e-27 Ns.

Wait, let me recompute E_vib as h w/(2 pi). So E= (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(2 pi) ≈ (2.65e-19)/6.283 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=E/c=4.21e-19 /3e8=1.403e-27 Ns.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, option C is 1.1e-27.

Hmm, 1.4e-27 isn't an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Compute E_vib = h w/(2 pi).

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi) = (2.6504e-19) /6.2832 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=4.21e-19 / 3e8 =1.403e-27 Ns.

Hmm, so 1.4e-27 Ns is not an option. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Wait, option B is 2.3e-27, which is about 1.6 times larger than my calculation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the energy as E = h w, without dividing by 2 pi. So E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. p=8.83e-28 Ns. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps the photon's momentum is related to the change in the angular momentum of the molecule.

In rotation, the angular momentum L is quantized as L = J hbar. So when a photon is absorbed, it imparts angular momentum to the molecule. But for a photon, the angular momentum is ± ħ. So perhaps the photon's momentum p is related to its angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the photon's angular momentum is L_photon = p * wavelength / c. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is considered as p = hbar k, where k is the wavevector. But I'm not making progress here.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which is (v=1, J=0), requiring delta E= h w. Then p= h w /c.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth of this. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be in terms of wavenumbers or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the given options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next rotational state, which would have delta E=2B.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave p=3e-31 Ns, which is way off.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I've spent a lot of time trying different approaches, but none match the options. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that it's the non-rigid rotor model, so the bond length isn't fixed. That affects the rotational energy because I is now variable. But I'm not sure how to model this without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dissociation energy, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon momentum to match the root mean square momentum of the molecule or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, and my calculation for the vibrational transition (with E=h w) gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, maybe I should compute 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. So that's 8.83e-28. The options don't have this, but option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum in the lab frame, considering the molecule's motion, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the photon's momentum is p = E/c, but perhaps in some other unit.

Wait, but 8.8e-28 Ns is 8.8e-28 kg m/s. The options are all in the same unit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns. Because 2.3e-27 is about 26 times larger than my calculated 8.8e-28. Hmm, 2.3e-27 is 230 times larger than 8.8e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6.626e-34 *4e14.

6.626e-34 *4e14=6.626 *4=26.504, so 26.504e-20=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational transition, which would give a much smaller p, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. The question states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the model includes both rotation and vibration, and the energy levels are a combination.

In that case, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. As computed earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy. So p=3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be the sum of both rotation and vibration. Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, so the next state would have either higher rotation or higher vibration.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps if I calculate using B in terms of cm⁻¹ and then E_rot = hc B_rot * (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = hc *231.6 cm⁻¹ *2= hc*463.2 cm⁻¹.

Compute E_rot = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s)(463.2 cm⁻¹).

But 463.2 cm⁻¹ =46320 m⁻¹.

So E_rot =6.626e-34 *3e8 *46320.

=6.626e-34 *1.39e13 = approx 9.2e-21 J.

p=9.2e-21 /3e8=3.07e-29 Ns. Still not matching.

I think I've exhausted all options. Based on earlier calculations, the vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28 Ns, which is closest to option D (1.4e-28) but not quite. However, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational, but I don't know the exact formula.

Given the options, I think the intended answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, option D is 1.4e-28, which is closer to my vibrational calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum in a different way, such as using the reduced mass in a different context. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum using the formula p = sqrt(2mE), but that's for particles in a box, which doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational transition, but I think the numbers don't add up.

Another angle: perhaps the question is considering the transition where the molecule goes from J=0 to J=1, which requires delta E=2B=9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns. But that's way smaller than any option. So perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: the question might be considering the molecule's center of mass moving, but in that case, the photon's momentum would be related to the molecule's mass and velocity, which is unrelated to the internal energy transitions. So that's probably not it.

I'm stuck, but based on the earlier calculations, I think the vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. Maybe I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B again, this time correctly.

Wait, B is (h^2)/(8 pi² I).

h=6.626e-34.

h squared=4.39e-67.

I=1.207e-46 kg m².

Denominator:8 pi² I=8 *9.8696 *1.207e-46= approx 95.3e-46=9.53e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 =4.6e-23 J.

So delta E=2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the rotational transition, but the given options are not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as the same as the molecule's root mean square momentum, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula for the rotational energy, such as B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), which would give a different value.

Wait, if B is (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), then B=4.39e-67 / (8 pi² *1.207e-46 *3e8).

Denominator:8 pi² I c= 95.3e-46 *3e8=2.859e-36.

So B=4.39e-67 /2.859e-36=1.536e-31 J.

Then delta E=2B=3.07e-31 J.

p=3.07e-31 /3e8=1.02e-39 Ns. Even smaller.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 1/6th of my vibrational calculation.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition but using w as the frequency in wavenumbers. Wait, no, w is given in rad/s.

Wait, perhaps the energy is E = (1/2) h w, but why would that be the case? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula E = I ω², treating it classically. So I=mu R²=3.02e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2=1.208e-46 kg m².

Then E=0.5*I*w^2.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E=0.5 *1.208e-46 * (4e14)^2.

=0.5 *1.208e-46 *1.6e29= 0.5 *1.208e-46 *1.6e29=0.5 *1.93e-17=9.65e-18 J.

p= E/c=9.65e-18 /3e8=3.217e-25 Ns. Still not matching.

Hmm. I think I've tried all possible approaches and none match the options. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the closest value. The vibrational transition gives p=8.8e-28, which is closest to option D (1.4e-28), but it's more than six times smaller. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation, and the correct factor leads to option B.

But I'm not confident. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest energy state), and the task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**:  
   The molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state corresponds to \(v = 0, J = 0\). The next possible states are:
   - \(v = 1, J = 0\) (vibrational transition)
   - \(v = 0, J = 1\) (rotational transition)

   The energy differences for these transitions are:
   - Vibrational transition: \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega\)
   - Rotational transition: \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B\), where \(B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I}\) is the rotational constant.

2. **Rotational Constant Calculation**:  
   The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated using the reduced mass \(\mu\) and bond length \(R\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]
   Using \(B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I}\):
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8\pi^2 (1.208 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   For the rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Vibrational Transition Calculation**:  
   The vibrational energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:  
   The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).  
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated rotational momentum (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\)) is far smaller than any of the given options. The vibrational momentum (\(8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)) is closer to the options but still does not match exactly. Among the options, the closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option D (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\))**, though it is about a sixth of the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem's options or a missing factor in the interpretation.

Given the analysis, the most reasonable choice based on the vibrational transition is:

**Answer: D**
