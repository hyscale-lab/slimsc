--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me outline the steps:

1. **Heating with excess KOH at 240°C** to form product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. The H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

2. **Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide** to form product 2.

3. **Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C**, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Alright, let me break it down.

**Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a bicyclic compound, the bromines are on adjacent carbons. So, KOH would eliminate HBr twice, probably leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the structure is adamantane with Brs on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is added, it'll abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br⁻, forming a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur. So, it might form an allene (conjugated diene) or a single double bond.

Alternatively, considering the structure of adamantane, which is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, the positions of the Brs might influence where the double bond forms.

Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? But that might not be possible due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent positions, and each elimination forms a double bond, but maybe it's a 1,3-diene.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, so the elimination would form a single double bond between those two carbons. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent in a diamondoid structure. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the adamantane structure is a diamond cubic-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. But since I can't, I'll think about it. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, and the numbering might be such that 1 and 3 are adjacent. So, when KOH is used, it would abstract a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene.

Wait, but the product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh wait, wait a second! If the reaction with KOH leads to elimination, but if the base is strong enough, perhaps it's not just elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait—if there's an elimination, perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, that's done with peracids.

Wait, more likely, the product is an epoxide wouldn't have a carbonyl in the IR. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, and the bromide leaves, forming a carbocation, but that's more for substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base but in a high temperature condition, so E2 elimination is more likely.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe the product is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is not just elimination but some kind of oxidation or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: When vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form carbonyl compounds. Oh, wait! Maybe it's the formation of a ketone via the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some elimination forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, could lose two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Because the elimination of two HBr's would form a double bond, but in this case, maybe it's forming a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a single elimination, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination of HBr. But in that case, we'd have a single elimination, forming a carbonyl. Or maybe two eliminations, but how?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of what the H NMR of product 1 shows. The peaks are:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): This is a singlet maybe, but 4.79 is typically around where CH₂ groups adjacent to oxygen (like ethers) or perhaps CH₂ in a carbonyl group. Wait, but 4.79 is more likely to be an -OCH₂- group or perhaps a CH₂ near an electronegative group.

- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H): That's a lot of hydrogens. Adamantane has a lot of CH groups. So perhaps this is the adamantyl structure.

- 1.94 ppm (2H): Maybe another CH₂ group.

The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? But with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons to two different CH groups, and elimination would form a ketone. Wait, no, because elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, but perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Hofmann elimination, but that typically leads to amines.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So, no.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? If each Br is eliminated with H, perhaps the carbons each lose H and Br, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br's carbon to lose H and Br, which would form a carbonyl. But that would require each Br to be adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. But then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

So, the reaction is 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by acid-catalyzed rearrangement? But KOH is a base, not an acid.

Wait! Wait a second—maybe it's a case of forming an epoxide, but that's not right because the IR doesn't match.

Alternatively, could the KOH cause a nucleophilic substitution, but with two Br atoms, perhaps leading to a dialcohol? But then the IR would show OH stretches, which might not be the case here. The product is a light yellow solid, which might not be an alcohol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming an alkene and then an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone resulting from elimination of two HBr molecules. Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. So, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. But how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a ring-opening or some rearrangement that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think about that.

1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantanone. That would have a ketone group. Then, the H NMR would have a peak from the ketone's adjacent CH₂ groups. But in the NMR data, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanone, the carbonyl would be on a bridgehead. How would the NMR look?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But that seems less likely.

Wait, the integration is 2H at 4.79 ppm. So perhaps a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen or carbonyl.

So, maybe product 1 is a diketone or a ketone with a CH₂ group next to it.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH in high temperature—maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts scenario? No, because the starting material isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, forming double bonds, but I'm not seeing the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests something deshielded. Maybe it's an -OCH₂- group, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in acetone, the methyl groups are around 2.1 ppm, but in this case, the CH₂ would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the adamantane CH groups, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, perhaps, or maybe a triplet or something else.

Wait, another angle: What if the product is an epoxide? Then, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH₂O group, but the IR would have an epoxide (around 1250 cm⁻¹) but no carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone.

So, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr to form a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a ring-opening of adamantane, forming a carbonyl. But I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated, leading to a ketone. So, elimination of HBr from each Br would form a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, if the structure is such that Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, then eliminating HBr would form a carbonyl. For example, if carbon 1 has Br, and carbon 2 has a CH₂ group, then eliminating H from C2 and Br from C1 would form an alkene. But that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but how would that form a carbonyl?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, perhaps the reaction forms 1-adamantanone. How?

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But then the NMR would show more than one set of peaks.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product isn't from elimination but from some substitution. But with two Br atoms, it's less likely.

Wait, maybe each Br is substituted by an -OH group. But then the IR would show broad OH peaks. The product is a solid, possibly a diol. But then the NMR at 4.79 ppm would be the OH groups as broad peaks, but it's a singlet. Plus, the IR doesn't show a broad peak, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but no carbonyl.

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the next step first.

**Step 2: Product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide**

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), reacting with Al(i-Pr)₃ would likely form an acylium ion or activate the carbonyl for further reactions. But what's the second reagent? Oh wait, the question says heating with excess Al isopropoxide. Maybe it’s a Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. But without a benzene ring, that's not applicable.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. So, maybe the next reaction is some kind of enol ether formation or another type of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation. But without a carbonyl, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a cyclization or some condensation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a β-keto ester or something similar, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the next step forms an enol ether. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl compound that forms a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone (diketone), and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes cyclization. For example, a Dieckmann condensation, which forms a cyclic β-keto ester. But product 1 is a solid, and the next step forms product 2.

Alternatively, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the third step.

**Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide addition**

Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The conditions (-78°C and then adding dimethyl sulfide) suggest reductive work-up, but wait, usually ozone is followed by Zn/H2O (reductive) or H2O (oxidative). Dimethyl sulfide is a mild reductant, perhaps leading to the formation of aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation.

So, product 3 would be the ozonolysis fragments of the double bonds in product 2.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone or similar) upon treatment with KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 upon treatment with Al isopropoxide (maybe forms an enol ether or something else).

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3, which is analyzed by NMR.

Wait, but considering that product 3's NMR is the focus, maybe the crucial part is understanding the structure of product 3.

Let me try another approach. Let me think about the possible structure of product 1.

Product 1's H NMR: a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (like oxygen). The 10H in 2.41-2.23 ppm are probably the adamantane CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH₂ group.

IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So, perhaps product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Let's imagine that. Then, the structure would have a ketone group in the adamantane framework.

Then, step 2: heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some type of enol derivative.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. It can facilitate the formation of enol ethers from ketones, but that usually requires an alcohol as well. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a β-keto ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is formed via some cyclization. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH peaks.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a conjugated diene. But the IR would then have C=C peaks, but the IR shows a strong C=O.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, which is a ketone. Then, product 2 is perhaps a dienone or some cyclic ketone formed via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, but that would have an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3.

So, working backwards:

Product 1 → product 2 (with a new double bond).

Product 1 is a ketone, perhaps. Then, product 2 has a double bond adjacent to the ketone.

How would product 2 form from product 1?

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers have double bonds. So, maybe product 2 is an enol ether derived from product 1.

Enol ethers can undergo ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if product 2 is an enol ether, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the structure.

Suppose product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a hemiacetal or enol ether is formed. Wait, but enol ethers are formed from ketones and alcohols in the presence of acid. Without an alcohol, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which has a double bond that can undergo ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, formed via a Diels-Alder reaction or some other process. But without a dienophile, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a conjugated diene adjacent to a ketone.

Let me imagine that product 2 has a structure like:

R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R' (that's a dienone). No, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of the ozonolysis step.

If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis will cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Depending on the substituents, product 3 would be two carbonyl-containing compounds.

But since the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, perhaps it's a simple aldehyde or ketone group with neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis, if product 2 is a symmetrical diene, product 3 would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, breaks into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl with adjacent CH₂ groups, the coupling would be as per the neighboring hydrogens.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky.

Wait, let's try to piece it all together.

1. Product 1 is derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. It has a carbonyl (IR) and an NMR with a 2H singlet at 4.79. Maybe product 1 is 1-adamantanone.

2. Product 2 is formed when product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in the enol ether would form two ketones or aldehydes.

But wait, enol ethers have a structure like R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but that's not correct. Enol ethers are R-O-C=CH₂.

So, if product 2 is an enol ether, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if product 2 is:

R-O-C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R'

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 could be the enol ether form, where the ketone has a double bond. Enol ethers are formed from ketones and alcohols in acidic conditions, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so maybe it helps in forming the enol.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is the enol ether of 1-adamantanone. So, the structure would have a double bond adjacent to an oxygen. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave the C=C bond, giving two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or a dialdehyde.

But in any case, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl group.

So, if the carbonyl is part of a CH₂ group, the hydrogens on that CH₂ would be deshielded and split based on neighboring hydrogens.

For example, if the structure is something like:

O=CH₂-CH₂-CO-R

Then, the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be split by adjacent CH₂ groups.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a methine (CH) group next to a carbonyl, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the coupling patterns.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is next to two equivalent hydrogens, it would be a triplet.

But if it's next to two sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, perhaps a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH₂ group, which has two protons, and maybe also another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a conjugated dienone which upon cleavage gives two carbonyls, each adjacent to CH₂ groups.

For instance, if product 2 is a conjugated dienone (double bond adjacent to two carbonyls), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would be two carbonyl groups connected by some structure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Another approach: Think about the possible products of ozonolysis.

If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have a structure like R-CO-R', where R and R' are the fragments from the double bond.

If the double bond in product 2 is between two CH₂ groups, then ozonolysis would yield two aldehydes (if both ends are CH₂), or ketones if one or both ends are R groups.

But in the case of an enol ether, the structure might be something like R-O-C=CH₂. Ozonolysis here would cleave to form R-O-CO and HCOOH (formaldehyde), but that depends on the work-up. With dimethyl sulfide (a mild reductant), perhaps it would form aldehydes.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring CH₂ groups.

In such a scenario, the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) would have two neighboring CH₂ groups, each with two protons. So, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, let's model this.

Suppose product 3 has a structure like:

O=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R

Then, the CH₂ next to the carbonyl (the first CH₂ after O=CH) would have neighboring Hs on both sides. The Hs on that CH₂ would be next to another CH₂ group (which has two Hs) and perhaps another group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure like:

O=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CHO

In this case, the CH₂ next to the aldehyde (O=CH-) would have two neighboring CH₂ groups, each contributing two Hs. So, each H on that CH₂ would couple with two Hs from each adjacent CH₂.

Wait, but in that case, the coupling would be from two neighboring groups, each with two Hs. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups, each of which has two Hs, then each H on the central CH₂ would have coupling with four Hs (two from each adjacent group). That would lead to a pentet.

Wait, let's think. If a CH₂ group is between two CH₂ groups, each adjacent CH₂ has two Hs. So, each H on the central CH₂ would couple with 2 H from the left and 2 H from the right, giving (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but in practice, it would be a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if the couplings are similar, it could be a pentet with J values adding up.

Wait, but for a CH₂ group with two neighboring CH₂ groups, each with two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets because each H on the central CH₂ is split by each H on the adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, each H on the central CH₂ is adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be split into (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a nonet. That's complicated, but in reality, sometimes the coupling constants are similar, and it might simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a CH group. For example, if the structure is O=CH-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CO-R, then the central CH₂ would be next to a CH group. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another methylene group. In that case, each H on the central CH₂ would be split by two Hs on each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in such a case, if a CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups, each with two Hs, each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to (n+1)(m+1) where n=2 and m=2. So, (3)(3) = 9, which would be a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is not from all four Hs but from two different sets.

Wait, another scenario: The most deshielded hydrogen is a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a methine (CH) group. Then, each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the CH and perhaps another group.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, going back to the starting point. The NMR of product 3 would show the coupling of the most deshielded H. Let's think about the possible structures.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, perhaps something like two ketones connected by a chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule where the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ group adjacent to two CH groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CO-R, then the central CH₂ would be next to a CH group with two Hs and another CH group.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

Option A: triplet. So, each H is split by two equivalent Hs. For example, adjacent to a CH₂ group.

Option B: triplet of triplets. Split by two different sets, each with two Hs.

Option C: doublet of triplets. Split by two different sets, one with two Hs and another with one H.

Option D: pentet. Split by four Hs, perhaps two from each side.

In ozonolysis product 3, the most deshielded H is likely near a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂ group.

If the CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups, each with two Hs, then each H on the central CH₂ would have coupling with both adjacent CH₂ groups. That would lead to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(2+1)=9, but that's not an option. So perhaps the coupling constants are similar, and it's a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group and a CH₂ group, the splitting would be more complex.

Another possibility: The most deshielded H is a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another methylene, which is adjacent to another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R. Then, the middle CH₂ would be next to two CH₂ groups. Each H on the middle CH₂ would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. So, that's a (2+1)(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the CH₂ is next to a CH group and a CH₂ group. Then, each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs from the CH group and the two Hs from the CH₂ group. That would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9, again a nonet.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ is next to a single H.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to two CH₂ groups. So, the CH would be split by each CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is a CH group next to a CH₂, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

If the most deshielded H is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group with two Hs, then each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the CH. That would give a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group (with two Hs) and another CH₂ group (with two Hs), each H on the CH₂ would have coupling with both sets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is between two CH groups, each with one H, that would lead to a triplet of triplets as well.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to decide. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet, as the H is adjacent to a CH₂ group. So, option A.

Alternatively, another possibility is a triplet of triplets if it's adjacent to two separate CH₂ groups.

Wait, in product 3, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂ group, which itself is adjacent to another CH₂. So, each H on the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. That would make a triplet of triplets, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH₂ group is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. So, each H on the central CH₂ would have coupling with both sets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is analyzed in the NMR spectrum. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH at 240°C, likely undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone, as indicated by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a strong carbonyl stretch).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, possibly 1-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (likely a ketone) is treated with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely forms an enol ether or a related structure with a double bond, setting up product 2 for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The reaction conditions (ozone at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide) suggest a reductive work-up, yielding aldehydes or ketones.

4. **Analysis of product 3's NMR**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.  
   - If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to two CH₂ groups (each with two hydrogens), the splitting would result in a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two sets of two equivalent hydrogens.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.
