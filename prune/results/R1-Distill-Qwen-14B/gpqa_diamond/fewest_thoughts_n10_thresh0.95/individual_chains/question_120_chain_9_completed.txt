Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, so the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that their actual number density in space is the same everywhere, right? So if I consider a region of space, the number of stars in that region depends on the volume, not the location.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx in arcseconds, distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of 1 pc, that's 1 arcsecond, and it's 1 parsec away. For a star at 2 parsecs, the parallax is 0.5 arcseconds. So higher parallax means closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I pick a small range of plx, say from plx to plx+dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume is n multiplied by the volume. But wait, how does parallax relate to the volume?

Let me think about the geometry here. For stars at a certain distance, the volume of space they occupy would be a spherical shell, right? The volume of a shell between distance d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r is 4πr² dr. So the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But since parallax (p) is 1/d, we can express d in terms of p. So d = 1/p, which means dd = -1/p² dp. Oh wait, because if p increases, d decreases. So when p is small (d is large), a small change in p corresponds to a larger change in d.

Wait, so let's change variables from d to p. The volume element in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ). But since we're looking for a positive volume, maybe I should think in terms of changing the integration variable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the number of stars between parallax p and p+dp. Let's model this.

The number of stars, dN, in a volume dV is n * dV, since n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

So dN = n * dV.

We have dV = 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp, then substituting:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp )? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify this.

Because p = 1/d → d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting d in terms of p into dV:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp.

Wait, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, so to get a positive volume, the upper limit of integration would be less than the lower limit. But for the purposes of the differential, we can take the absolute value, so dV becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait no, wait another moment. Let me think again. Because dV is 4π d² dd. And since dd = - (1/p^2) dp, then dV is 4π d² (-1/p² dp) → but d is 1/p, so substituting:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p^2) dp → 4π (1/p^4) (-dp). But since we're considering a small positive dp, maybe we can express it as 4π (1/p^4) dp, because the negative sign just indicates the direction of integration, but the volume is positive.

So, dV = (4π) (1/p^4) dp.

Then, the number of stars in this shell (dN) is n * dV, because n is the number density (stars per volume). So dN = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp → dN = (4π n) (1/p^4) dp.

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So when p increases, the number of stars in that shell drops off as 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So if I have a small range dp, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx (dp) is ~ 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the volume element is a spherical shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then d² = 1/p², and dd = -1/p² dp. So substituting, dV=4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp = 4π (-1/p^4) dp. Taking the absolute value, it's 4π (1/p^4) dp. So yes, dV is proportional to 1/p^4 dp.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. The number of stars in a small volume element \( dV \) is given by \( dN = n \, dV \).

The volume element \( dV \) for a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). Since parallax \( p \) is related to distance \( d \) by \( p = 1/d \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -1/p^2 \, dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( dV \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
dN = n \, dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means that as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
