Okay, so I've got this science question here about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when the energy is high. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”infinite results that don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you remove the cutoff later. But some theories might not need this because they're inherently finite or because they have a different structure.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Strings are tiny loops of energy, right? I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and is a candidate for a theory of everything. But wait, does it require regularization? I remember that in string theory, the perturbation series is different. Maybe because it's a background-independent theory or because the higher-order terms are better behaved. Or perhaps it's because string theories avoid certain divergences due to the nature of strings. I'm not super sure, but I think string theories might not require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs because they have a different structure, like a higher-dimensional or more symmetric framework.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative methods work well. But does it require regularization? Well, in QFT, you often need regularization to handle loop divergences. QCD calculations do involve regularization, like using lattice QCD or other methods to make the math manageable. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. Renormalization handles the infinities by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge. But wait, renormalization is a form of regularization? Or is it a separate process? I'm a bit confused. I think regularization is a step before renormalization. So even though QED is renormalizable, it still needs regularization to handle the divergences that come up in loop diagrams. So QED would require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, that's the non-quantum version. In classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, you don't have the same issues with infinities that you get in quantum theories. Like, in classical electromagnetism, you can have point charges which have their own problems (like the infinite self-energy), but in reality, I think these are handled in a different way or maybe ignored because classical theories don't deal with the same divergences in the same way as quantum field theories. Since it's classical, perhaps it doesn't require regularization at all because the math doesn't produce those kinds of infinities in the same way.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So looking back, the options are quantum theories except option D. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So if a theory doesn't use QFT, it might not need regularization.

So D, classical electrodynamics, doesn't require regularization because it's a classical theory, not a quantum one. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but what about the other options? Superstring theory is a quantum theory, right? So it's part of QFT, but perhaps it doesn't require regularization because it's formulated differently. Or maybe string theories avoid some divergences due to the way they handle higher dimensions or because certain string states don't lead to the same divergences as point particles in QFT.

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Regularization is a step in
