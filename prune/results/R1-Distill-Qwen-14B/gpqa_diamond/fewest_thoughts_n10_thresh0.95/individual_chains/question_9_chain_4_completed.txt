Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry classes, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. I think C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for the cyclic group, so the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. The 'h' indicates a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the molecule into two mirror images.

Looking at the options given, there are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with long names that I probably need to parse.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests a tricyclic structure with three furan rings attached to a central structure. Triphenylene rings might have some symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is a symmetric structure, right? It has three benzene rings connected in a way that's symmetric. But wait, the substituents here are furans. How are they attached? If the structure is symmetric with three similar substituents around a central point, that could allow for a three-fold rotation. Also, a horizontal mirror plane might be present if the structure is flat in some way. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another complex name. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused with something else. The trifuran suggests three furan rings attached. The numbering seems to suggest where the rings are attached. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, maybe in a trigonal planar fashion, that could give a three-fold axis. But I'm not certain about the mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's not C3h but another group like C3 or C2.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is [(i-Pr)3B]O-. The structure is a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron, making a three-fold rotation axis. If it's planar, then there might be a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but triisopropyl borate is actually a planar molecule. Because each isopropyl group is symmetric and the structure is flat. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane. That sounds like C3h symmetry. Hmm, so this could be a strong candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a fused bicyclo structure. I think it's a norbornane derivative with a seven-membered ring. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, so does it have any symmetry? I recall that quinuclidine has a C2 axis because of the bridge, but I'm not sure about the mirror planes. Wait, maybe it has a center of inversion? Or perhaps a mirror plane? Maybe it's a C2v or something else, but I don't think it's C3h because it's not symmetric enough for three-fold rotation. The structure is more about two-fold axes.

Wait, but let me get back to the options. The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. So I need to figure out which of these four has that.

Let me think about each structure again:

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): The structure is a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So, the arrangement around B is trigonal planar, which gives a three-fold rotation (C3). Now, for the mirror plane: if the molecule is flat, then a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. Wait, but in reality, the isopropyl groups are bulky and might not lie in the same plane. Or do they? Wait, no, the borate ion is planar because the boron is sp2 hybridized. So the three isopropyl groups are arranged around the planar boron, making the molecule planar overall. So a horizontal mirror plane would be present. So this would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, what about the other options? Let's make sure.

Option B: The benzo[...]trifuran... So, it's a benzene ring fused with three furan rings? Or maybe benzo attached to a trifuran? I'm not exactly sure, but the structure would have three substituents attached symmetrically. If the three substituents are arranged at 120-degree angles around the central structure, then a C3 axis exists. But do they also have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, perhaps if the substituents are symmetric and lie in a plane, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a C3 axis but no mirror plane, making it C3 instead of C3h.

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So, three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure with three phenyl rings connected in a way that's symmetric. If the furan system is attached in a symmetric fashion, maybe the overall structure would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I'm thinking that the molecule might be more complex and perhaps belong to a higher symmetry group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another point: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for the mirror plane, the molecule must be flat in a certain direction. Triisopropyl borate is planar, so that fits. If the other molecules are not planar, they might not have the horizontal mirror plane needed for C3h.

So, which options are planar? Triisopropyl borate is planar. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic structure, so it's not flat. The other two options (A and B) are polycyclic compounds. Benzo and triphenylene derivatives might have flat structures or not.

Wait, for example, quinuclidine is a rigid structure with a bridge. It's a seven-membered ring, but it's not flat. So it's probably not C3h.

So back to option C: triisopropyl borate. If it's planar, then it should have a horizontal mirror plane, and the three-fold rotation would be from the trigonal planar structure. So that would make it C3h.

But wait another thought: the mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, meaning it's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So in a planar molecule, a horizontal mirror plane would be the plane that contains the molecule. For example, in benzene, which is planar, the mirror plane is the plane that contains the ring. Similarly, in triisopropyl borate, the molecule lies in a plane, so the mirror plane would be that same plane, which is horizontal if the molecule is flat.

So putting this together, the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the definition of **C₃h** symmetry. This point group requires a **three-fold rotation axis (C₃)** and a **horizontal mirror plane (h)**. The molecule must be planar to accommodate the horizontal mirror plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule has a complex structure with three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. While it may have a three-fold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of substituents, it is unlikely to have a horizontal mirror plane. The structure appears to be non-planar due to the polycyclic nature of the molecule. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule involves a benzene ring fused with a trifuran system. While it may have a three-fold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of substituents, the molecule is not planar. Therefore, it lacks the horizontal mirror plane required for **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate consists of a planar boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar geometry. This arrangement provides a **three-fold rotation axis (C₃)**. Additionally, the molecule is planar, which allows for a **horizontal mirror plane (h)**. Thus, it exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic molecule with a rigid structure. While it may have a two-fold rotation axis, it is not planar and lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane due to its planar structure.
