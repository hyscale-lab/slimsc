Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are different powers of r, like r cubed, r fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So, parallax plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yeah, right, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because the closer a star is (small d), the larger its parallax (big plx).

Okay, so the number of stars N varies with 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to plx^(-5). But since d is 1/plx, maybe I can express N in terms of d.

Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ (1/d)^(-5) because plx is 1/d. Wait, (1/d)^(-5) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So they probably want the number of stars per unit distance, like dN/dr. Or perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr, which would be proportional to 4πr² times something. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a certain region is given as N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting gives N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about the change with distance. Like, if you move to a slightly larger distance, how does the number of stars change? Or, for a given range of distance dr, how many stars are there?

Wait, perhaps they're asking for the number density as a function of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr would be something like dN = (d^5) * 4πr² dr? Or wait, maybe not. Because N is given as varying with parallax, but perhaps the expression is per unit area or something else.

Wait, alternative approach. The number of stars per unit area (since it's a region of the sky, which is an area) as a function of distance.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because I'm not sure whether the given relation is for all stars within a distance d, or for stars at a particular distance. The question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So I need to clarify. Let's assume that for stars at a particular distance, the number per unit area (since it's a region of the sky) is N = k / plx^5.

But wait, since plx is 1/d, then N = k * d^5.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a volume element. Typically, the number of stars in a volume depends on the density. But here, the question seems to relate N to parallax, not to volume.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a question about how the number of stars in a region (which is an area on the sky) varies with distance. For example, imagine looking at the sky and counting stars in a certain area. How does the count change as you look further away.

Wait, in reality, the number of stars you can see increases with distance up to a point because there are more stars in the larger volume, but beyond a certain distance, you can't resolve them or they become too faint. But in this question, it's given as a specific relation.

Wait, so the number of stars in a region of the sky (so same area) varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that becomes N = k * d^5.

But wait, that doesn't make sense in real terms. Because as d increases, the number of stars in a fixed area would generally increase, but not as d^5. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So Volume is (4/3)π d^3, so N ∝ d^3. But the given relation here is N ∝ d^5, which is different.

But the given relation is N varying as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So perhaps we're assuming a different kind of distribution of stars, not the standard Euclidean one.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit distance changes. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be the derivative of N with respect to d.

So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So that would mean the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. Because d is the same as r here, right? Because d is distance.

Wait, but the options include a ~r^4 option, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try with another approach.

Alternative approach: Let's model the number of stars as a function of distance. The question says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

So N = K * d^5, where K is some constant.

But the number of stars per unit distance is the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5 K d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So the answer would be option C, which is ~r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is related to distance (\( d \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This implies that the number of stars increases as the distance increases, following a \( d^5 \) dependence.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \) (since \( d \) and \( r \) represent the same quantity in this context). Among the given options, the correct choice is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
