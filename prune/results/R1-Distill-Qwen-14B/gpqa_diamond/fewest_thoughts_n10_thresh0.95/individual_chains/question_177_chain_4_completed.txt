Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their luminosities. Hmm. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

So the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. But wait, the question is about luminosities, so mass might not directly factor into that. Oh, right, maybe mass relates to luminosity through other properties like radius and temperature?

The problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That probably has to do with their temperatures. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is given by Wien's Law: λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Or wait, same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The stars are black bodies, so their spectra should peak at wavelengths governed by their temperatures. So using Wien's law, same peak wavelength means same temperature. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're comparing two stars, the constants and π and σ would cancel out. So, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.25 as the only choice. Let me check the options again. The options are A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23, B and C are 2.32 and 2.35. So A is 2.25, which would be the straightforward answer based on R and T.

But wait, did I miss something else? The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. How does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh, wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. It affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths were the same after accounting for this Doppler shift? Or was that already considered?

Wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So when we observe from Earth, the peak wavelengths have been shifted due to their velocities. So we need to correct for the Doppler shift to find the intrinsic temperatures.

Wait, that's an important point I might have missed. So let me think again.

The peak wavelengths we observe (λ_obs) are related to the intrinsic peak wavelength (λ_emit) by the Doppler formula. For a star moving towards us, λ_obs is shorter than λ_emit (blue shift), and moving away would make it longer (redshift).

The Doppler formula is λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, v_r is in units of the speed of light. Oh, wait, in km/s, and the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is a small fraction.

Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c ). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta is v/c. But let me get the exact formula right.

Wait, the correct Doppler shift for wavelength when moving directly away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ), where beta is v_r / c. But in our case, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is λ1_emit = λ1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. So its observed wavelength would be λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + (700/c)) / (1 - (700/c)) ), assuming it's moving away. But wait, wait—the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700, but it doesn't specify whether Star_2 is moving towards or away. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Hmm. Wait, radial velocity can be positive or negative, but in this case, it's given as 700 km/s. So if Star_1 is at rest, and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + (v/c)) [approximate for small v]. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact Doppler shift formula here.

Wait, let me think again. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ_obs is shorter.

In this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit, since its radial velocity is 0. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c ). But according to the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + (700)/c ). Wait, but wait, 700 km/s is the radial velocity of Star_2. But do we know if it's moving towards or away? The problem states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. If the velocity is positive, it's moving away, so λ_obs would be longer.

Wait, but the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, λ1 = λ1_emit. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + (v_r)/c ). But λ1 = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + (v_r2/c) )

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute that. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 /3e5 = 0.002333... So v_r2/c ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + (700/3e5) ≈ 1.002333.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 1.002333.

But wait, the peak wavelength λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_emit = (hc)/(5kT) (something like that, but the exact formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K. So λ_max ∝ 1/T.

So, λ1_emit = (b)/T1, λ2_emit = (b)/T2.

Wait, but from the observed wavelengths, we have:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c )

But since λ1_emit = (b)/T1 and λ2_emit = (b)/T2, substituting:

(b)/T1 = (b)/T2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

The b's cancel out. So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which rearranges to T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ) / 1.

Wait, that would suggest T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/3e5 ). Let's compute that. 700/3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

So (1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted, so the observed λ is longer. But since both observed λ are same, that implies that Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Therefore, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. Because λ ∝ 1/T. So if λ_emit2 is shorter, T2 is higher.

Wait, but according to the calculation above, T2 = T1 * 1.002333. So T2 is higher than T1.

But earlier, I thought that since the observed λ's are same, T1 and T2 must be same. But that was wrong because I didn't consider the Doppler shift. So now, with Doppler shift, T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if T2 is higher, then the luminosity calculation changes.

So let me restate:

We have L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

We also found that T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

v_r2 is 700 km/s, so v_r2/c = 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So let's plug into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( (1)^2 * (T1 * 1.002333)^4 )

= (2.25 * T1^4) / ( T1^4 * (1.002333)^4 )

The T1^4 terms cancel, so:

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4

Compute (1.002333)^4:

Let me compute that. Let's compute ln(1.002333) to approximate.

ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 ... for small x)

But perhaps a better approach is to compute (1.002333)^4 step by step.

First, compute (1.002333)^2.

1.002333 squared is approximately:

= (1 + 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.004671.

Now, square that to get (1.004671)^2:

= (1.004671)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.004671) + (0.004671)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009342 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.009364.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009364.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009364 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.009364) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, option A is 2.25.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but why did the Doppler shift affect this? Because I initially thought that the temperatures were same, leading to L1/L2=2.25, but the Doppler shift meant that T2 is a bit higher, making L2 a bit higher, so L1/L2 is less than 2.25. So the correct factor is a bit less than 2.25, around 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Peak Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), this implies that the intrinsic temperatures of the stars are related by the Doppler shift due to their radial velocities.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For Star_2, the intrinsic temperature \( T_2 \) is related to Star_1's temperature \( T_1 \) by:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx T_1 \sqrt{1.00467} \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]

Thus, \( T_2 \approx 1.00233 T_1 \).

### Luminosity Ratio:
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 \approx 1.00233 T_1 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 T_1^4}{T_1^4 (1.00233)^4} = \frac{2.25}{(1.00233)^4}
\]

Calculating \( (1.00233)^4 \):

\[
(1.00233)^4 \approx 1.00936
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00936} \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. The correct option is:
