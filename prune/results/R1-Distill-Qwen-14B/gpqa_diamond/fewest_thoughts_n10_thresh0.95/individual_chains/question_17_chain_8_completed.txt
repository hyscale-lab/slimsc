Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric means that the ratio is 1:1? So each Ca is paired with one EDTA molecule. And the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to bind the metal ion. The temperature is 25°C, which might affect the K value, but the K is given as 5x10^10. So, the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5e10.

The options are A) 2e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1e-2. So, I need to find [Ca²+].

I think this involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is formed as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- form. So the dissociation reaction would be:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The formation constant, Kf, is given. Wait, wait, the K given is K_Ca-EDTA. Oh, I think Kf is the formation constant. So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

But wait, in solution, the concentration of free Y^4- might be very low because EDTA is a strong chelator. But in this problem, we have the complex in solution, so we can model the dissociation.

So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let the concentration of CaY²− be 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of that breaks down into Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Let me set up an ICE table. Initial concentrations: [CaY²−] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [Y^4−] =0.

Change: Let x be the amount dissociated.

Then, at equilibrium:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably small compared to 0.02, but I might need to check that later).

[Ca²+] = x

[Y^4−] = x

So the Kf expression is:

Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}) )

Plugging in, Kf = (0.02)/(x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x: 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) ≈ 1.414e-6.5... Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, sqrt(2e-13) is sqrt(2) * 1e-6.5. Let me compute 2e-13. The square root of 2 is about 1.414. So 1.414 *1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 4.47e-7. Wait, but wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, yes. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 4.47e-7. Hmm, but none of the options match that exactly. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression. Alternatively, perhaps K is the dissociation constant, not the formation constant. Wait, no, the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. Formation constant is the equilibrium for the formation of the complex, so higher K means more complex formation. So, the K is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}).

So, the expression is correct. So 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5. Wait, wait, 2e-6.5 is 2/(1e6.5) → 1e6.5 is 3.16e6, so 2/3.16e6 ≈ 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. So x is about 6.3e-7 M. [Ca²+] is x, so that's the answer. So the correct option is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of calcium ions dissociated from the complex at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02 M)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \) M. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
