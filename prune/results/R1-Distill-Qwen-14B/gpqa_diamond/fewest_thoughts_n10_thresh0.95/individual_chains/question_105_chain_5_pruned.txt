Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots must be at 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. 

The problem says that when we look at the star's brightness over time, the spots cause variations because as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. This can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, blocking some light. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same change in brightness as these spots do?

So, the key is to compare the change in brightness (the dip) caused by the spots to the dip that would be caused by a planet. The main difference is that the planet would block light from a circular area, while the spots have a certain coverage and temperature.

Let me get the given data straight:

- Star radius Rstar = R_sun (but we might not need the exact value)
- Filling factor (f) = 20% = 0.2. But wait, the spots cover one hemisphere. So the filling factor is per hemisphere? Or is it the total area covered on the entire star? Hmm, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so each hemisphere has 20% coverage. So the total area covered on the star is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). But when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. So when the star shows the spotty hemisphere, we see 20% of that hemisphere covered. So the variation in brightness would come from the spots being blocked as the star rotates, but wait, no, the spots are cooler, so the brightness variation is due to the spots being less bright when they are in view.

Wait, the problem says that the observation is a periodic variation in brightness because of rotational modulation. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness to dip when the spots are facing us. But the star's brightness is lower when spots are visible because they are cooler.

So, the net effect is that when the star is showing the spotted side, the overall brightness is a bit lower. The amplitude of this dip would be the same as the dip caused by a planet transiting in front of the star.

So to find the radius of the planet that would cause the same dip, I need to compute the relative change in brightness (delta F) in both cases and set them equal.

First, let's compute the delta F from the star's spots.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0. When spots are present, the flux is lower.

Each spot has a temperature of Tspot = 5000K, and the surrounding area (non-spot) has T = 6000K. The filling factor f is 0.2, which is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots.

The flux from the star when the spots are visible would be F = F0 * (1 - f) * ( (T_spot / T_star)^4 ) + f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )? Wait, no, because the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the spots and the unspotted areas.

Wait, the star's total flux is given by integrating the flux over its surface. The flux per unit area is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * T_star^4 * (4 pi R_star^2) / (4 pi) ) = sigma * T_star^4 * R_star^2. Because the surface area is 4 pi R^2, but flux is per unit area, so integrating gives F0 = sigma T^4 * R^2.

When spots are present, the total flux is F = (unspotted area) * sigma T_star^4 + (spotted area) * sigma T_spot^4.

The unspotted area is (1 - f) * A, where A is the area of the hemisphere. Spotted area is f * A.

Wait, but wait, because when the star is showing one hemisphere, the area is 2 pi R^2 (since it's a hemisphere). So the total area of the star that's visible is 2 pi R^2. The spots cover f fraction of that, so spotted area is f * 2 pi R^2.

So, the flux from the star when the spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_star^4 + f * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4.

The flux without spots (F0) would be when f = 0, so F0 = 2 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4.

The change in flux is F - F0 = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ] = 2 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4 [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) - 1 ]

Simplify that:

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4 [ (1-f -1 ) + f (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T_star^4 [ -f (1 - T_spot^4 / T_star^4 ) ]

So the change in flux is delta F = F - F0 = - F0 * f ( 1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 )

So the fractional change in flux is delta F / F0 = - f ( 1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 )

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) would be this fractional change.

Wait, but in the problem, the star's variation is due to the spots. So the dip in brightness when the spots are facing us is delta F / F0 as above.

Now, for the planet transit case, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star. The dip is (Area of planet's disk) / (Area of star's disk) ) = (R_planet / R_star )^2.

Because when the planet transits, it blocks an area proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, so the flux drops by that fraction.

But wait, the problem states that the star is not covered by spots in this hypothetical exoplanet case, but the spots are present. Wait, no: wait, the question says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So in the exoplanet case, the star is not spotted, but the planet transits, causing a dip. So in that case, the dip is simply (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we need to set the dip from the spots equal to the dip from the planet.

So,

f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) = (R_planet / R_star )^2

Because the dip from the spots is f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )) and the dip from the planet is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

So,

R_planet / R_star = sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) )

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.2

T_spot = 5000 K

T_star = 6000 K

Compute 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

0.8333^4: Let's compute step by step.

0.8333^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

0.6944^2 = (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f (0.2) gives 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

Take square root: sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that's about 0.32. So R_planet / Rstar is approximately 0.32. But wait, that's the dip due to the planet. But wait, wait, the dip from the spots is a decrease in flux, so the dip is negative, which I have accounted for in the equation.

Wait, but the dip from the planet is (R_planet/Rstar)^2. So plugging in, we get (R_planet/Rstar)^2 = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.10355. So R_planet/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So option D is ~0.32. That seems to be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when the star has spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, but the star's brightness is lower. But when the star is spot-free (as in the planet case), the dip is when the planet blocks the flux. But in the spot case, the dip is a decrease in brightness, and the planet's dip is also a decrease. So the amplitude (the fractional change) is the same in both cases.

Wait, but in the spot case, the dip is a decrease because the spots are cooler, so their presence reduces the total flux. In the planet case, the dip is when the planet blocks some of the flux, so it's also a decrease. So the fractional dip is the same in both cases.

So the calculation should be correct.

Hmm, but let me think again. The fractional change when the spots are visible is delta F / F0 = -f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) as I had before.

The planet's fractional change is - (R_planet / R_star )^2.

We set these equal in magnitude, so:

f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )) = (R_planet / R_star )^2.

Which is what I did. So the answer is approximately 0.32, which is option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's spots, we compare the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios.

### Key Information:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Filling factor**: \( f = 0.2 \)

### Step 1: Fractional Change in Brightness Due to Spots
The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its surface area and temperature:
\[
F_0 \propto T_{\text{star}}^4 \cdot R_{\text{star}}^2
\]
When spots are present, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
\[
F \propto (1 - f) T_{\text{star}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]
The fractional change in flux is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]
Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
\]
First, calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{36} \approx 0.6944, \quad \left( \frac{25}{36} \right)^2 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -0.2 \left( 1 - 0.4823 \right) = -0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx -0.1035
\]

### Step 2: Fractional Change in Brightness Due to a Planet
For a planet transiting the star, the fractional change in brightness is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
The closest option to \( 0.3218 \) is **D) ~0.32**.

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately **0.32**.
