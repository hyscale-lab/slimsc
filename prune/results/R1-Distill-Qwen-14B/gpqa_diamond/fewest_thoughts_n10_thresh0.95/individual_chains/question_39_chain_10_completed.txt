Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Let me read the problem again.

So, we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find 'a'.

Wait a second, in quantum mechanics, the wave function squared gives the probability density, right? So the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1 because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%.

But wait, the wave function here seems a bit odd. Oh, wait, the wave function might have a real part and an imaginary part. Oh, right, because the wave function can be complex. But in the problem statement, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually written as a sum of real and imaginary parts. But if the wave function is complex, the probability density is the square of the absolute value, which is the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the probability density would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, but the problem says that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but the given function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) which is a real function. Wait, but in the solution, the wave function can't have a constant imaginary part because that would contribute to the probability density outside the region. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wave function. Maybe the given function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because the problem says that when they measure, they find particles only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside this interval.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i in the part of space where the particle can exist. So that part is between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But actually, the wave function given is a complex function, so the probability density isn't just the real part squared. It's (real part)^2 plus (imaginary part)^2. So the probability density is [ (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

But wait, because the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the square of the absolute value of the wave function is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because for any complex number z = z_real + i*z_imag, |z|^2 = z_real^2 + z_imag^2.

So the probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But when we integrate this from x=1 to x=3, it should be 1. So:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

∫₁³ (a²)/(1+x) dx + ∫₁³ (0.5)^2 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

The first integral: a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C.

Evaluated from 1 to 3:

= a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral: (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So integrating from 1 to 3:

0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the integral.

Wait, the probability density is |ψ|² = [a/(√(1+x))]^2 + [(-0.5)]^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral = ∫₁³ (a²/(1+x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx.

The first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2), as before.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the answer is option B.


To determine the value of \(a\), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\). The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\). Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the total probability must integrate to 1 over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating this from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. **Second integral**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

This is straightforward:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \implies a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
