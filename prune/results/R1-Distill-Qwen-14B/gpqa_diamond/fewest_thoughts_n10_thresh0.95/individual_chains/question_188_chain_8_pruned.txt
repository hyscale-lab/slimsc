Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. 

Interplanar distance... Oh yeah, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos(alpha)/a^2) ) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, for a cubic system, it's a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)), but rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees. 

Oh right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles alpha, beta, gamma (all same in rhombo) is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(gamma)) ) ). Since all angles are 30 degrees here, and the plane is (111), so h=k=l=1.

So plugging in the numbers: h=1, k=1, l=1. So the denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30) ). Let's compute that.

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.8660.

So 3 terms of cos30, each multiplied by 2*(1*1) so each term is 2 * 0.8660 *1*1*1. Wait no, wait wait. Let me look again at the formula. 

The expression inside the square root is: h² + k² + l² - 2*(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos gamma) )? Wait no, I think the formula is h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma). Oh wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me think again. For a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal or a general triclinic? No, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice with all a, b, c equal and all angles equal. So the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos gamma) )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Maybe it's more like this: for a general crystal system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos gamma ) ).

Wait, maybe that's the correct form. So in this case, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, and h=k=l=1, let me plug in:

Denominator inside sqrt: 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 )

Wait, that equals 3 - 2*(3 * cos30). Because each of the three terms is cos30, so 3 terms multiplied by 2*(1*1) each. So 3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2)).

Compute that: 3 - 2*3*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3.

Wait, because 2*(3*(√3/2)) is 3√3. So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3√3). Wait, but wait 3 - 3√3 is approximately 3 -5.196= -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative. Can't take square root of a negative number. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ). Because in a rhombohedral system, since all angles are the same, perhaps the formula simplifies. Let me think: in a cubic system, angles are 90, so cos terms are zero, but here the angles are 30. So for rhombohedral, the formula for d is a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), since all the angles are the same. So yeah, that makes sense.

So with h=k=l=1, it's 1+1+1=3. The second term is 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) cos30. So 2*(3) * (√3/2) = 3√3. So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3√3). Which is again 3(1 - √3), which is negative. Hmm, that can't be. What am I doing wrong here.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is actually a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) ). No, that can’t be right either, because for cubic, when cos α is zero, the denominator would be sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct. But with angles, the formula would involve cosines. Maybe I'm missing a sign.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is: d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - [2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos γ)] ). Wait, no, that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it another way.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) ), but I might have the sign wrong. Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but that would have a positive term, but that doesn't make sense for angles less than 90 degrees. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha } }

But since the angles are 30 degrees, cos30 is positive. So let's compute:

h=1, k=1, l=1. So the numerator is 1^2 +1^2 +1^2 =3.

The denominator: 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30 = 2*(3) * (√3/2) )= 3√3.

So the entire expression inside the square root is 3 -3√3. Which is approximately 3 -5.196 = -2.196, which is negative. That can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. So I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually a divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but that would be different. Let me see. For a cubic system (alpha=90), cos alpha is zero, so the formula becomes a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct. But if the angles are different, perhaps the formula includes a plus instead of minus. But wait, in the case of alpha=60 degrees, for example, cos60 is 0.5, and hkl=111, would that give a positive denominator?

Wait, let's try with a different approach. Maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the structure of the rhombohedral crystal. Alternatively, perhaps there's another formula that uses the reciprocal of the lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2) (cos α + cos β + cos γ) + (cos α cos β + cos α cos gamma + cos beta cos gamma) )/(a²)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and all angles equal, the formula simplifies.

Another thought: Perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ). But in this case, the denominator becomes 3 - 2*(3) * cos30. Wait, that's 3 -6*(√3/2) =3 - 3√3 ≈3 -5.196= -2.196. So negative again. That's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should reverse the sign. Let me think. Since the interplanar distance is a real number, the denominator inside the sqrt must be positive. So perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, let's compute that. For h=k=l=1, denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(√3/2))= sqrt(3 + 3√3). Let me compute that: 3√3 ≈5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196. Square root of 8.196 is about 2.864. So a is 10 Angstrom, so d=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstrom. But that's not one of the options. The options are all around 8-10. So this can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let me think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different because in rhombohedral systems, the Miller indices have some constraints.

Wait, another thought: In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by h^2 +k^2 +l^2 = ... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for d is a/(sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )). But in this case, the denominator is negative, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, it's 2*(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos gamma), but in the case of rhombo, all three angles are same, so perhaps it's 2*(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos alpha) = 2 cos alpha (hk + hl + kl). But that would make it 2 cos alpha (3) for h=1,k=1,l=1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*3 cos alpha. So 3 (1 - 2 cos alpha).

Wait, cos alpha is 0.866, so 2 cos alpha is about 1.732. So 1 - 1.732 = -0.732. Multiply by 3 gives -2.196. Again, negative. So no solution.

Hmm, this can't be right. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Which would give for h=k=l=1:

Denominator: 3 - 2 [ (1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 ) ] = 3 - 2*(3 * 0.866) =3 - 2*2.598=3 -5.196=-2.196. Again negative.

So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is different. Wait, I think I found a source that says the general formula for interplanar distance in a triclinic system (which rhombo is a special case of) is:

d^2 = a^2 (h² +k² +l²) − 2a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) / (h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - ( (h +k + l)^2 cos α ) / something )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of vectors. The lattice vectors are a, b, c.

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a, and angles between them are alpha. So the dot product between a and b is a² cos alpha, between a and c is a² cos alpha, and between b and c is a² cos alpha.

The interplanar distance for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a* )² + (k b* )² + (l c* )² )

Where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But since in rhombo, a = b = c = a0 (say), and the angles are all alpha, the reciprocal vectors can be found using:

a* = (1/a) * ( ... ) Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) [ 1, 0, 0 ] + (1/a) [ ... ] Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the reciprocal vectors. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the reciprocal vectors in a rhombohedral system.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) (1, 0, 0 )
b* = (1/a) ( cos alpha, sin alpha, 0 )
c* = (1/a) ( cos alpha, (cos alpha cos beta - cos gamma )/(sin alpha), sqrt(1 - (cos alpha cos beta - cos gamma )²/(sin² alpha) ) )

Wait, this is getting complicated, but since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, let's plug in.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the reciprocal basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² +k² +l²) ) / ( (h +k + l)^2 - 2 (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) (1 - cos alpha) ) )

Wait, that might not be correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula from the Structure of Crystals textbook. Oh wait, I'm making this up, but I'll try to think through.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 (1 + 2 cos alpha )^(3/2) ). Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha } }

But earlier calculation gives negative, which can't be. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, let's compute that for h=1, k=1, l=1.

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos30 ). Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 + 2*3*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196. Square root is about 2.864. So d = 10 / 2.864 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9-10. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm completely off here. Maybe I should think about this differently. Maybe the rhombohedral system can be treated as a special case of a cubic system with a distortion. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is a function of the angles but I'm not recalling the correct formula.

Wait, another thought. In a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the planes are not cubic, so the distance is a scaled version. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and use that to find the interplanar distance. The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α )^something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's try that. For h=1, k=1, l=1:

Denominator: sqrt( 3 + 2*(3)*(1 - cos30) )

cos30 is about 0.866, so 1 - cos30 ≈0.13397.

So 3 + 2*3*0.13397 =3 + 0.80382 ≈3.80382. Square root is about 1.95, so d=10/1.95≈5.13 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the vectors defining the crystal planes.

In a rhombohedral system, the plane (hkl) can be represented by vectors. The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the vector that is perpendicular to the plane and of length 1/d, scaled by the lattice parameter.

Wait, another approach: The reciprocal lattice vector for a plane (hkl) is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. The magnitude of this vector is 1/d, so d = 1 / |g|, where g is the reciprocal lattice vector.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be determined based on the direct lattice vectors. The direct lattice vectors are a, b, c, all equal in length, with angles alpha between each pair.

The reciprocal vectors a*, b*, c* are given by:

a* = (1/a) ( 1, 0, 0 )
b* = (1/a) ( cos α, sin α, 0 )
c* = (1/a) ( cos α, (cos α cos β - cos gamma) / sin α, sqrt(1 - [ (cos α cos β - cos gamma) / sin α ]^2 ) )

But since alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees, let's compute this.

First, compute cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660, sin30=0.5.

Compute the components of c*:

First component: cos α = 0.8660
Second component: (cos α cos β - cos gamma)/ sin alpha. Since beta and gamma are also 30 degrees:

cos alpha cos beta = 0.8660 * 0.8660 ≈0.75.

So (0.75 - 0.8660)/0.5 = ( -0.116 ) /0.5 ≈-0.232.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, beta is 30, gamma is 30. So cos beta = cos30, cos gamma=cos30.

So cos alpha cos beta = (sqrt(3)/2)^2=3/4=0.75.

So (0.75 -0.8660)= -0.116.

Divide by sin30=0.5 → -0.232.

The third component is sqrt(1 - (-0.232)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0538) = sqrt(0.9462)≈0.9727.

So c* ≈(0.8660, -0.232, 0.9727 ) / a.

So the reciprocal vectors are:

a* = (1/a, 0, 0 )
b* = (0.8660/a, 0.5/a, 0 )
c* = (0.8660/a, -0.232/a, 0.9727/a )

Now, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl)= (1,1,1) is g = h a* + k b* + l c*

So g = 1*a* + 1*b* +1*c*.

Compute each component:

x-component: 1*(1/a) + 1*(0.8660/a) +1*(0.8660/a) = [1 +0.866 +0.866 ] /a = (2.732)/a.

y-component: 1*0 + 1*(0.5/a) +1*(-0.232/a) = (0.5 -0.232)/a = 0.268/a.

z-component: 0 +0 + 1*(0.9727/a )= 0.9727/a.

So the reciprocal vector g has components (2.732/a, 0.268/a, 0.9727/a ).

The magnitude of g is |g| = sqrt( (2.732/a)^2 + (0.268/a)^2 + (0.9727/a)^2 )

Compute each term:

(2.732)^2 ≈7.464

(0.268)^2 ≈0.0718

(0.9727)^2 ≈0.946.

Sum: 7.464 +0.0718 +0.946 ≈8.4818.

Divide by a²: 8.4818 / a².

So |g|= sqrt(8.4818)/a ≈2.9126/a.

Since d = 1/|g|, d= a /2.9126.

Given that a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstrom.

So d=10 /2.9126 ≈3.436 Angstrom.

Wait, but the options are all around 9-10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal vector calculation.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. In the formula for the reciprocal lattice vector, a*, b*, c* are reciprocal vectors, so their magnitude isn't 1/a, but depends on other terms. Wait, perhaps the reciprocal vectors are not correct. Because in a cubic system, a* is 1/a, but in rhombo, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct reciprocal lattice vectors formula. The reciprocal vectors are defined as:

a* = (1/a) (1, 0, 0 )

b* = (1/a) ( cos α, sin α, 0 )

c* = (1/a) ( cos α, (cos α cos β - cos γ )/( sin α ), sqrt( 1 - [ (cos α cos β - cos gamma )/( sin alpha ) ]^2 ) )

Wait, but in our case, alpha = beta = gamma=30 degrees.

So compute the components:

cosα = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660, sinα=0.5.

Compute the second component of c*: ( cosα cos beta - cos gamma ) / sin alpha.

Since beta and gamma are 30, cos beta=cos gamma=0.8660.

So,

cos alpha cos beta =0.8660 *0.8660= 0.75.

So (0.75 - 0.8660)/0.5 = (-0.116)/0.5 = -0.232.

Third component of c*:

sqrt(1 - (-0.232)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0538) = sqrt(0.9462)=0.9727.

So the reciprocal vectors are:

a* = (1/a, 0, 0 )

b* = (0.8660/a, 0.5/a, 0 )

c* = (0.8660/a, -0.232/a, 0.9727/a )

Then the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is g = a* + b* + c*.

So,

x-component: (1 +0.8660 +0.8660 ) /a = (2.732)/a.

y-component: (0 +0.5 + (-0.232) ) /a = (0.268)/a.

z-component: (0 +0 +0.9727)/a = 0.9727/a.

Magnitude of g:

sqrt( (2.732/a)^2 + (0.268/a)^2 + (0.9727/a)^2 )

Compute each term:

2.732^2 ≈7.464.

0.268^2≈0.0718.

0.9727^2≈0.946.

Sum: 7.464 +0.0718 +0.946 ≈8.4818.

So |g|= sqrt(8.4818)/a ≈2.9126/a.

Thus, d=1/|g|=a/(2.9126) → 10/2.9126≈3.434 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the reciprocal vectors. Maybe I should have taken the reciprocal of the magnitude, not the vector.

Wait, wait. No, the reciprocal lattice vectors are part of the reciprocal space, so their magnitudes are reciprocal of d. So if |g|=2.9126/a, then d= a/2.9126 ≈3.434 Angstroms. But the options don't have this. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula for the reciprocal lattice vector is different. Perhaps the reciprocal vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) (1, 0, 0 )

b* = (1/a) ( cos α, sin α, 0 )

c* = (1/a) ( cos α, (cos α cos beta - cos gamma )/( sin alpha ), sqrt( 1 - [ (cos alpha cos beta - cos gamma )/( sin alpha ) ]^2 ) )

But maybe I should have used a different approach for the magnitude calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for d is (a) divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos alpha) ). Let me try that.

So for (111):

3 + 2*(3)*(1 - 0.866) →3 +6*(0.134)=3 + 0.804=3.804. sqrt(3.804)=1.9506. So d=10/1.9506≈5.129 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ), but theta is 60 degrees. Wait, why would that be? Because in rhombohedral, the angle between the vectors is 60 degrees? No, the given angle is 30 degrees. I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices. For a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane might correspond to a different spacing. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different because of the angles.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a formula online. Oh wait, I can't, but I'll try to think.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha} }

Wait, but in that case, for h=1, k=1, l=1, it would be sqrt(3 + 3*2*0.866)=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864, so d=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is different for rhombo. Maybe in rhombo, the reciprocal of the interplanar distance is given by sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) )? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit cell. Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter a is the interatomic distance, right? So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system, which might be given by a / sqrt(3(1 - cos30)).

Wait, compute that: sqrt(3*(1 - 0.866))=sqrt(3*0.134)=sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

So d=10 /0.634≈15.76 Angstrom. Not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a/(sqrt(3 (1 + cos30 ))). Let's compute: 3*(1+0.866)=3*1.866=5.598. sqrt(5.598)=2.366. So d=10/2.366≈4.225. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, if I take the reciprocal of 1.732 (which is sqrt(3)), 1.732≈sqrt(3). So 10 / 1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm missing is d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) )) * (some factor based on angles).

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated as a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l^2) + something).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and I should just think about the structure. In a cubic system, the (111) plane has d= a/sqrt(3). For a=10, that's about 5.77. But in a rhombohedral system with angles less than 90 degrees, the planes are closer or further apart?

Wait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is approximately 5.77 Angstroms. But the options are about 9 Angstroms. So perhaps the formula in this case is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the projected area or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) ) ), but for h=1, that would be sqrt(3 -6)=sqrt(-3), which is impossible.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should try to look for another approach, perhaps using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 (1 - 3 * (cos α )^2 + 2 cos^3 α )^(1/2) ). For alpha=30 degrees, let's compute that.

cos30=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So,

(1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.75)^(3/2) )

Wait, no, cos^3(30)= (0.866)^3 ≈0.6495.

So,

1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) =1 -2.25 +1.299= (1-2.25)= -1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈a^3 *0.221.

But I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is given by d= a / (sqrt(3) * sin(alpha/2) )

Wait, for alpha=30, sin(15)=0.2588.

So d=10/(sqrt(3)*0.2588)≈10/(1.732 *0.2588 )≈10/(0.448 )≈22.32. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Maybe the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstrom. But I have no idea how to get there. So perhaps I should make a guess. Wait, perhaps I should compute using another approach. Let me try to compute using the formula d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) )

Wait, for h=1, k=1, l=1: sqrt(3 +6)=sqrt(9)=3. So d=10/3≈3.333 Angstrom. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

Which would be sqrt(3 + 6)=3. So d=10/3≈3.333. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different and I should use the angle between the planes. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is a function of the angles in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, but earlier calculation gives sqrt(3 -6 *0.866)=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value of the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for alpha=30, gives:

sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864. So d=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstrom. Not matching options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I need to conclude that perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstrom, but
