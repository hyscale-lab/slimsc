Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator. Hmm, let's see. The operator is Ay, which is given as c times S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, but wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are involved in spin operators. Oh right, S is probably related to the Pauli matrices. But wait, each Pauli matrix is usually multiplied by ħ/2. Or wait, maybe not. Let's think: The spin operator S in the x, y, z directions are often given as S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But in this case, the given matrix S might be something else.

Wait, the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write S out:

S =
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, because the Pauli y matrix is usually written as σ_y = (0, -i; i, 0). So S must be equal to σ_y. So S = σ_y.

But wait, the operator Ay is given as c * S. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin angular momentum operator is usually (ħ/2) σ. Because ħ is h/(2π). So ħ/2 is h/(4π). Oh! So c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y. So this is the usual S_y operator, the y-component of spin.

So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Oh wait, but wait, the operator Ay is c * S, which is (h/(4π)) * S. Since S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1, because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y would have eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π))*(-1). So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That seems off because eigenvalues of Ay should be real numbers, not complex. So I'm confused.

Wait a second, wait. Wait, S is a matrix that's pure imaginary. Let me compute Ay:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So let's compute that. The entries would be:

First row: 0 and (-i)(h/(4π)).

Second row: i*(h/(4π)) and 0.

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with:

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Hmm, now, the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix like this can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) =0.

So the matrix Ay - λ I is:

[ -λ      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h)/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (i^2 h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Because (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) )= (-i²) h²/(16 π²) )= (h²)/(16 π²) ) because i^2 is -1.

So determinant: λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Take square roots: λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, so the eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

Wait, but looking back at the options, looking for which options have real eigenvalues.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh and real parts of ±h/(4π). That's not right because the eigenvalues are real. So the imaginary part should be zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not right either; they're not complex.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A is a spin component, any eigenstate of Ay would be an eigenstate of A² because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is the Casimir operator, and commutes with all components. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Well, Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So option C says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That sounds correct, I think.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. But the basis is probably the standard basis, but eigenfunctions can be different.

Wait, let's go back to the options.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and since Ay is a component, they commute, so yes, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². Because [Ay, A²] =0.

But they won't be eigenstates of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (maybe A_x?), so they don't commute. So yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct.

But let's think about the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay. Well, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so its basis is the standard basis. The eigenfunctions would be the eigenvectors of Ay, which are not necessarily the same as the standard basis, unless the matrix is diagonal in that basis. Since Ay isn't diagonal, its eigenvectors form a different basis. So option D is incorrect; the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator only if it's diagonal in that basis, which it's not. So D is wrong.

Looking again at option C: It's correct.

Now, the original question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So the possible correct options are C.

But wait, what about the eigenvalues—did I miscalculate?

Wait, the initial setup: Ay = c S, where c = h/(4π). And S is the Pauli matrix σ_y. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1, so eigenvalues of Ay are ± c. So λ = ± h/(4π).

So in the options, none of the options A or B have real eigenvalues. Wait, actually, option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 but the real parts are ±1. That implies the eigenvalues are complex numbers, which is not the case here because Ay is a Hermitian operator.

Wait, wait. Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Because the angular momentum operator should be Hermitian. Let me check.

The matrix Ay has elements:

[0, (-i h)/(4π) ]

[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

The conjugate transpose of Ay would be:

[ 0, (i h)/(4π) ]

[ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is not the same as Ay. Because Ay has (-i h)/(4π) in the top right, and (i h)/(4π) in the bottom left. So the conjugate transpose would have (i h)/(4π) in top right and (-i h)/(4π) in bottom left.

So unless (-i h)/(4π)= (i h)/(4π), which only happens if h is zero, which it's not, Ay is not Hermitian. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, because in reality, the spin operator S is Hermitian. Let me think: S is σ_y, which is Hermitian because σ_y† = σ_y.

Wait, σ_y is:

0  -i

i  0

The conjugate transpose would be:

0  i

- i 0

Which is the same as σ_y. So σ_y is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian.

Then c is a real constant, so c S is also Hermitian. Therefore, Ay must be Hermitian.

Hmm, but according to the matrix I wrote earlier, Ay isn't Hermitian. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recalculate.

Wait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

S^† would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ].

Which is the same as S, so S is Hermitian. Then Ay = c S is Hermitian if c is real. Since c = h/(4π), which is real, so Ay is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues must be real.

So earlier calculation holds: eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So looking at the options again:

Option A: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are purely real.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), and they are real.

So options A and B can't be correct. So the correct statements must be either C or D.

I think I was right earlier about option C being correct. Because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az.

So, the correct answer would be C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix. The matrix \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) into \( A_y = c \cdot S \), we get:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & -i \\ 
   i & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) is:
   \[
   A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
   -\lambda & \frac{-i h}{4\pi} \\ 
   \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The determinant is:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
   \]
   Solving this gives the eigenvalues:
   \[
   \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator and commutes with \( A_y \), but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** Claims the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), not necessarily the standard basis.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
