Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that this is a 2-dimensional metric, probably on some surface. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, wait—pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid or something. So it's a surface with a saddle shape.

Wait, but the metric here might represent a space with a specific curvature. Let me recall that the metric in 2D can be written in different forms. Oh, the standard metric for a space of constant curvature is usually something like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²) for polar coordinates, but here the metric is given in terms of x and y.

Wait, the given metric is in terms of dx² + dy², and the coefficient is a function of x² + y². So maybe it's in Euclidean coordinates or something. Let me think about what kind of geometry this would represent.

The general form for a metric with constant curvature in 2D is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 + k r²)^2 or something like that for positive curvature, or maybe a different form for negative. Wait, but here I have a metric that's scaled by 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the Gaussian curvature. For a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by some formula involving the derivatives of g. Let me remember that formula. I think it's K = -(1/(2 g)) * [ (dg/dx)(dg/dy) - (dg/dx)^2 - (dg/dy)^2 ) ] or something like that. Or maybe it's a different expression.

Alternatively, in 2D, for a metric ds^2 = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is -f''(r)/f(r). Wait, but this is for polar coordinates. Hmm. Maybe I should convert the given metric into polar coordinates to find the curvature.

Let me try that. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. The metric becomes ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in polar coordinates, it's ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So f(r) in this case is sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, but for a metric in polar coordinates, the general form is ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ², where B(r) = A(r) r² for flat space, but here B(r) would be A(r) r². Let's see what A(r) is.

So A(r) = 32/(4 - r²), and B(r) = 32 r²/(4 - r²). So the ratio B(r)/r² is (32 r²/(4-r²)) / r² = 32/(4 - r²) = A(r). So that's consistent.

Now, for a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature K is given by [sqrt(A B)]'' / sqrt(A B) + something? Wait, no, I think the formula for K is (1/(2 B)) [ (B')/r ) ]' - (B)/(2 r^2) ). Hmm, perhaps I should look up the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric. The formula I recall is K = -(1/(2 g)) [ ( (∂g/∂x)/g )' + ... ] but I'm a bit shaky on that.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the Ricci scalar in 2D, which is the same as the Gaussian curvature. The formula for K in terms of the metric components is:

K = -(1/(2 g)) [ (∂²g/(∂x²)) + (∂²g/(∂y²)) - 2 ∂²g/(∂x ∂y) ) ] / g ?

Wait, perhaps not. Another approach is to remember that for a metric g_{ij}, the Ricci scalar in 2D is R = (e1 (k1) + e2 (k2)) where k_i are the principal curvatures, but maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 g)) (∂_x (∂_y g) - ∂_x² g - ∂_y² g ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for a metric ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²) where g(r) is a function only of r. In that case, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - [ g''(r) / g(r) ] - [ (g'(r)/g(r))² ] + [ (g'(r)/ (r g(r)) ) ]

Wait, I think I might be mixing up terms. Let me check.

No, wait, for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K= -f''(r)/f(r) - (f'(r)/f(r))². Because for a metric f(r)² dr² + f(r)² r² dθ², the components are g_rr = f², g_θθ = f² r², and g_rθ=0.

The formula for K in 2D is:

K = (-1/(4 f²)) [ 2 (f²)' ' r + (f²)' (2/r) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Ricci scalar using the formula for 2D:

R = (1/(f)) [ (d² f)/(dr²) ) + (1/r) (df)/(dr) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the standard formula for curvature in polar coordinates.

Wait, I think for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ (B')/(2 A r) ) ] - [ (B)/(2 r²) ) ] - [ (A')/(2 A² r) ) ] 

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me find the Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor, then compute the Ricci scalar. But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric.

Given the metric ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), so in terms of f(r), f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, the general formula for a metric in polar coordinates, ds² = a(r) dr² + b(r) dθ², the curvature is given by:

K = [ (b')/(2 a r) ) ] - [ (b)/(2 r²) ) ]

Wait, I found this formula somewhere in my notes. So let me see: a(r) = 32/(4 - r²), and b(r) = a(r) r² = (32 r²)/(4 - r²).

So compute K:

K = [ (b')/(2 a r) ) ] - [ b/(2 r²) ]

First, find b'(r):

b(r) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)

So b'(r) = [ (64 r (4 - r²) ) + 32 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, let's compute that. Using the quotient rule: (numerator)' = (64 r (4 - r²))' 

Wait, wait, no, more accurately, b'(r) = [d/dr (32 r²)] * (4 - r²) + 32 r² * [d/dr (4 - r²)^-1 ]

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it as (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ) derivative:

b'(r) = [ (64 r) (4 - r²) ) - (32 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Simplify numerator:

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] 

= 64 r [ (4 - r²) + r² ]

= 64 r *4 = 256 r

So b'(r) = 256 r / (4 - r²)^2

Now, plug into K:

K = [ (256 r / (4 - r²)^2) ) / (2 a(r) r) ) ] - [ (32 r²/(4 - r²) ) / (2 r²) ) ]

Simplify each term.

First term: numerator is 256 r / (4 - r²)^2, denominator is 2 a(r) r.

a(r)=32/(4 - r²), so 2 a(r) r = 64 r/(4 - r²).

So first term: [ (256 r ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]  / [ (64 r )/(4 - r²) ) ] = [256 r / (4-r²)^2 ] * [ (4 - r²)/(64 r) ) ] = (256 / (64)) ) * (1/(4-r²)) ) = 4/(4 - r²)

Second term: [32 r²/(4 - r²) ] / (2 r²) ) = [32 / (4 - r²) ] / 2 = 16/(4 - r²)

So K = [4/(4 - r²)] - [16/(4 - r²)] = (4 -16)/(4 - r²) ) = (-12)/(4 - r²) )

Hmm, so K = -12/(4 - r²) )

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of b'(r). Let me recompute it.

b(r) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)

Let's compute the derivative using the quotient rule:

b'(r) = [ (64 r)(4 - r²) - (32 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

Factor 64 r:

= 64 r [ (4 - r²) + r² ] / (4 - r²)^2

= 64 r *4 / (4 - r²)^2

= 256 r / (4 - r²)^2

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the first term in K:

(256 r / (4 - r²)^2) / (2 a(r) r )

a(r) is 32/(4 - r²), so 2 a(r) r = 64 r / (4 - r²).

So the denominator is 64 r/(4 - r²).

So [256 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] / [64 r/(4 - r²)] = [256 / (4 - r²)^2 ] * [ (4 - r²) /64 ) ] 

The r cancels out, and (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator:

= (256 / 64 ) * 1/(4 - r²) ) 

256 /64 =4, so 4/(4 - r²).

Second term:

b/(2 r²) = [32 r²/(4 - r²)] / (2 r²) ) = (32/(4 - r²)) / 2 = 16/(4 - r²)

So K = (4/(4 - r²)) - (16/(4 - r²)) = (-12)/(4 - r²) )

Hmm, so K is negative, which makes sense for a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in the metric given, the denominator is 4 - x^2 - y^2, which translates to 4 - r^2 in polar coordinates. So r^2 <4, so r<2. So the maximum r is 2.

Hmm, but pseudosphere has infinite area. Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think. A pseudosphere has finite volume in 3D, but in 2D, the area might be infinite. Because as you go out, the geometry is hyperbolic, and the area element integrates to infinity.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere in 2D is actually finite. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, in 2D, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But a pseudosphere is like a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it's a compact surface with finite area. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the 2D pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature and has finite area. So for example, the area is 4π a^2, where a is a parameter, like the curvature radius.

Wait, but in this problem, the radius is given as r=2. Wait, but the radius in the metric is related to the curvature. Let me think.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, but in polar coordinates, it's ds²= [32/(4-r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the curvature K is given as K = -12/(4 - r^2).

Wait, but that's varying with r. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because a pseudosphere should have constant negative curvature. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing K.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for K. Let me double-check the formula for the Gaussian curvature.

In 2D, for a metric ds² = e^{2φ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is -e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')² ].

Wait, in our case, the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So e^{2φ(r)} = 32/(4 - r²). So 2φ(r) = ln(32/(4 - r²)).

So φ(r) = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Compute φ'(r) = [ (1/2) * ( ( -2 r )/(4 - r²) ) * (32/(4 - r²)) )^{-1} } ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute φ'(r).

Wait, e^{2φ} =32/(4 - r^2).

So 2φ= ln(32) - ln(4 - r^2)

So φ= (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r^2)

So φ'(r) = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2 r) )/(4 - r^2) ) ] 

= (1/2) [ 2 r/(4 - r^2) ) ] 

= r/(4 - r^2)

Then φ''(r) = [ (4 - r^2) * 1 - r*(-2r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2 

= [ (4 - r^2 + 2 r² ) ] / (4 - r^2)^2 

= (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2

So now, K = -e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')^2 ]

Compute e^{-2φ} = e^{- ln(32/(4 - r^2))} = (4 - r^2)/32 * e^{0} } = (4 - r^2)/32.

Wait, because e^{ln(a)}=a. So 32/(4 - r^2) is e^{2φ}, so e^{-2φ} = (4 - r^2)/32.

Now, φ'' + (φ')^2 = [ (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ] + [ r²/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= [4 + r^2 + r^2 ] / (4 - r^2)^2 

= (4 + 2 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2

So K = - e^{-2φ} * [ (4 + 2 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

Substituting e^{-2φ} = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [ (4 + 2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= - [ (4 + 2 r²) ] / [32 (4 - r²) ) ]

= - (2 (2 + r²) ) / [32 (4 - r²) ) ]

= - (2 + r²) / [16 (4 - r²) ) ]

Hmm, this is still position-dependent, which contradicts the expectation that a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So perhaps the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere, but something else.

Wait, but the question states that it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, perhaps the radius here refers to the curvature radius. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the radius a by K= -1/a². So if K is -1/4, then a=2.

But wait, according to our calculation, K is varying with r, which suggests that the metric isn't one of constant curvature. That can't be right because a pseudosphere is a surface of constant curvature.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because the given metric is supposed to be a pseudosphere. Or perhaps I got the metric wrong.

Wait, looking back at the original metric: ds²=32/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, it's 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So for r=0, the coefficient is 8, and as r approaches 2, the coefficient goes to infinity. So the geometry is singular at r=2.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is non-singular. So perhaps the question is not about a pseudosphere, but about a hyperbolic space? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic space in 2D, which has constant negative curvature. But in that case, the metric would have a form like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - k r²) ) or something similar, where k is positive (negative curvature), but perhaps scaled.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the metric is of a space with negative curvature, but not necessarily a pseudosphere. The question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?"

Wait, but if the metric is given, perhaps it's not a pseudosphere but something else. Because in our calculation, the curvature K is position-dependent, which contradicts the constant curvature of a pseudosphere.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus less on curvature and more on the area.

The area of a surface given by a metric can be found by integrating the area element over the entire surface.

The area element in this metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal in x and y, the determinant is just g_xx * g_yy = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the metric is:

g_{xx} = 32/(4 - r²)

g_{yy} = 32/(4 - r²)

So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy - g_xy². Since g_xy is zero, determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2.

So the area element is sqrt(det) dx dy = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area element becomes (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral over all space of the area element.

The domain of integration is where 4 - r² >0 => r^2 <4 => r<2.

So the integral is from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π.

So A = ∫∫ (32 r / (4 - r²)) dr dθ.

Integrate θ first: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0 to 2 [32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute this integral.

Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

Substituting:

∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) ) = ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u = ∫ [ -16 du ] / u = -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to 2:

At r=2, u=0; but wait, when r=2, denominator becomes 4 -4=0, so the integral approaches -16 ln 0, which tends to infinity. But wait, the integral from 0 to 2 is:

-16 [ ln(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(0) approaches -infty.

At r=0: ln(4)= ln4.

So the integral becomes:

-16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16 [ -infty - ln4 ] = positive infinity.

So the area A = 2π * (infinity) = infinity.

So the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric, and the question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area, we first convert the metric into polar coordinates, where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\). The metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in this metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, \(\det(g) = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element simplifies to:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The domain of integration is determined by the condition \(4 - r^2 > 0\), which implies \(r < 2\). Therefore, the total area \(A\) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Now, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \int \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = -16 \int \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral evaluates to:

\[
-16 \ln|u| + C = -16 \ln|4 - r^2| + C.
\]

Now, evaluate from \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\):

\[
-16 \ln|4 - r^2| \Big|_0^2 = -16 \ln(0) + 16 \ln(4).
\]

As \(r \to 2\), \(4 - r^2 \to 0\), and \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\). Thus, the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This result indicates that the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite. Among the given options:

- **A)** \(0\) is incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B)** \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\) and **C)** \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\) are incorrect, as they are not valid expressions for the area.
- **D)** \(+\infty\) is correct, as shown by the calculation.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Answer: D
