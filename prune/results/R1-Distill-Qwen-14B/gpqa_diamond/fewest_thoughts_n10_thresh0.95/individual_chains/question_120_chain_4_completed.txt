Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it's a multiple-choice question. Let me try to think it through.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the same number of stars in any given volume, right? And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to the power of 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. Oh right, that's the formula: distance (d) = 1/plx. So as plx increases, distance decreases, meaning the star is closer.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. So I'm looking for the number density as a function of plx. Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to that volume.

But wait, how does parallax relate to the volume? Let me think. If we consider a spherical shell at a certain distance d, the thickness of that shell in terms of distance would relate to a range in parallax. Let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. What distance range does that correspond to?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The change in distance dd would be the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that: dd/dplx = -d/(plx^2). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for a small change in plx, dplx, the change in distance is about dd ≈ -d/(plx)^2 * dplx. Since plx is small (parallax is usually in fractions of an arcsecond), maybe positive delta plx is a decrease in distance. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the volume.

The number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. Let's imagine a thin shell between d and d + dd. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. Because it's a thin shell, the volume is the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd).

But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 4πd² dd. But we need to express this in terms of parallax, plx. Since d = 1/plx, then d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is the change in distance. Wait, but how does dd relate to dplx? Let me think: plx = 1/d. So if plx increases by a small amount dplx, then d decreases. The differential relationship is d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → taking derivative, dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So for a small change in plx, dplx, the change in distance dd is approximately - (d^2) dplx. Since plx is positive, and increasing plx means decreasing d, but we can take the absolute value for the volume.

The volume of the shell (dV) is 4πd² dd. Substituting dd from above, dV = 4π d² (d^2) dplx. Because dd = (1/(plx^2)) dplx, but since plx is 1/d, plx^2 is 1/d². So dd = (d²) * dplx.

Wait, let me substitute d as 1/plx. So d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx²). So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (d^2) * dplx. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.

Wait, dV = 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = (d²) * dplx, which is (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

dd is the change in d. So dd = (d²) dplx? No, wait, I think I messed that up. Let me do it properly.

From plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides:

dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the change in d is proportional to the negative of the change in plx divided by plx squared.

So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the thickness of the shell in distance is dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx.

But for the volume, which is positive, we take the absolute value, so dV = 4π d² |dd|.

Substituting d = 1/plx and |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

dV =4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ?

Wait, no. Wait, d² is (1/plx)^2, and |dd| is (1/plx^2) dplx.

So,

dV =4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that would make dV proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. Hmm, does that make sense?

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express it.

dV = 4π d² * dd.

But dd is (d²) dplx → Wait, no. Wait, the relation is:

dd = -(1/plx²) dplx.

But since plx =1/d, then plx² = 1/d². So,

dd = -d² * dplx.

So, dV = 4π d² * (d² dplx) ?

Wait, that can't be right because then dV would be proportional to d^4, which is (1/plx)^4, because d =1/plx.

Wait, but that seems off. Let me think about the transforms again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by expressing the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. The number of stars would be the volume of the shell between d and d+dd, multiplied by the number density.

Since the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant. Let's say n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec). Then the number of stars in the shell is n * dV.

But I'm to find the number per unit plx, which would be dN/dplx. So, dN = n * dV.

So, dV in terms of plx is 4π d² |dd|.

But d =1/plx, so d² =1/(plx)^2.

And |dd| is the absolute value of dd, which from earlier is (1/plx^2) dplx.

So,

dV =4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx =4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is n * 4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but that would mean the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. That's option A.

But wait, I'm not confident because another approach I've heard of might give a different result. Let me think differently.

Another approach: the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the shell at distance d =1/plx with thickness dd = (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

The volume of that shell is 4π d² dd.

Which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx =4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think about the physical meaning. If I imagine a higher plx (closer stars), the volume per unit plx is smaller? Because at lower distances (higher plx), the shell's volume is smaller. So the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx increases, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the differential: n(parallax) dplx = number of stars between plx and plx +dplx.

So, n(plx) dplx = (number density) * dV.

Which is n * 4π d² dd.

But since d =1/plx, and dd = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, n(plx) dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Which gives n(plx) = 4π n (1/plx^4).

So n(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. That's option A.

But wait, another way to think about it: in terms of solid angles. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. The volume in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx, leading to the same conclusion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard before that the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but I'm not sure if that's the same as this question.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of flux or something else, but no, the question is about the number per unit range of plx.

Wait, another way: if the stars are uniformly distributed, then the density is constant. The number in a volume is density multiplied by volume.

So, for a given plx, the distance is d=1/plx. The volume between d and d+d delta is 4pi d^2 delta d.

But delta d = (d^2) delta plx. Because from plx to plx + delta plx, the delta d is -d² delta plx.

So volume is 4pi d^2 * d² delta plx.

Which is 4pi (d^4) delta plx.

But d=1/plx → d^4 = (1/plx)^4.

So volume is 4pi / (plx^4) delta plx.

Number of stars is density * volume → so number per delta plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

So the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting the same answer each time. So I think the correct answer is A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I recall that the number of stars in a given volume depends on distance cubed, but maybe that's when considering the count in a certain direction, but this is a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substituting the terms. Let me check again.

dV =4pi d^2 dd.

But dd is (d^2) delta plx, because dd = d^2 delta plx. Since delta plx= delta (1/d) = (-1/d²) delta d → delta d= -d² delta plx.

So,

dV =4pi d^2 * (d^2 delta plx) )=4pi d^4 delta plx.

But d=1/plx → d^4=1/(plx^4).

So,

dV =4pi (1/plx^4) delta plx.

Thus, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 per unit plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.

Wait, another angle: if I imagine a unit increase in plx, how does the volume change? At higher plx, which is lower distance, the volume per unit plx is larger, so more stars would be found per unit plx. Wait, but according to our calculation, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases, which would mean that closer stars (higher plx) are actually having fewer stars per unit plx. That doesn't make sense because at higher plx (closer stars), the volume of the shell is smaller, so the number of stars would be fewer, but if you have a fixed density, the number in a unit plx range would be lower. But if you have a fixed number density, but the volume per unit plx decreases, then the count would decrease.

Wait, wait, higher plx (closer) → more stars, right? Because you can see more stars nearby. But according to the calculation, the number per plx unit is going down. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Because for a given plx, the shell's volume is 4pi d² dd. But the dd for a given dplx is smaller as d increases. Wait, no, if plx is higher, d is smaller, so dd becomes larger. Because if plx is small, like 1 parsec, then a small change in plx would correspond to a larger change in d. Let me think: for plx=1, d=1. So plx increases by 0.1, to 1.1. Then d becomes 1/1.1 ≈0.909, so dd is about 0.091. So for a small delta plx, the delta d is roughly (1/(plx^2)) delta plx. But when plx is small, delta d is larger. So at closer distances (larger plx), the same delta plx corresponds to a larger delta d, making the shell's volume larger. But wait, because the shell's radius is larger, but the delta d is larger. So the shell's volume could be larger, but the number of stars per unit plx would depend on how the volume scales with plx.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me take an example. Suppose plx = 0.5, d=2. For a delta plx of 0.1, the new plx is 0.6, new d=1.666..., so delta d is about 0.333. So the volume is 4pi*(2)^2 * 0.333 ≈4pi*4 *0.333≈5.333 pi.

Now, if plx is 10, d=0.1. delta plx=0.1 → new plx=10.1, d=1/(10.1)=~0.0990099. delta d= ~0.00099. So the volume is 4pi*(0.1)^2 *0.00099≈4pi *0.01 *0.00099≈~0.0000396 pi.

So for the same delta plx, when plx is larger (close), the volume is much smaller. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So at larger plx, the same delta plx gives a much smaller volume, leading to fewer stars per unit plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases. But at lower plx (farther away), the same delta plx captures more volume, so more stars per unit plx. So the function would be 1/plx^4, which falls off rapidly as plx increases.

So the correct answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we assume the stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance in parsecs. For a small change in parallax, \(d\text{plx}\), the corresponding change in distance, \(d\text{d}\), is given by:

\[
d\text{d} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(d\text{d}\) is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 d\text{d}.
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(d\text{d} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the number of stars in the shell is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(d\text{plx}\)) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\text{plx}\) increases, and the relationship is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\).
