Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE is assumed, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 (assuming the lower level population is the same as star_2's?), but wait, maybe it's more precise to compare the ratios between the two stars. Let's think.

Wait, actually, the ratio for each star would be (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper/g_lower) are the same for both stars, because it's the same element (iron) and same energy levels. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower depends only on the exponential term for each star.

So for star_1, let's say the ratio is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). For star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think it means that the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2. So n1_upper/n2_upper = 2? Or is it (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower)? I think the latter, because each star's ratio is R1 = n1_upper/n1_lower, R2 = n2_upper/n2_lower. So the observed is R1 = 2 * R2. Because the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Or wait, maybe the question states that the excited state population is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Suppose that the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Then n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

But wait, each star's own ratio is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower, R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower. But unless we know how the lower levels compare, it's a bit tricky. But perhaps the question is more straightforward. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of excitation is given as the ratio of their populations. So for a specific energy level, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2, for the same element. But wait, the same element's ground state might also be different. Hmm, maybe it's better to model the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, but in the problem, perhaps the ratio of the excitation is given as (n_upper/n_lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me write that down.

Take natural logs of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Wait, let's factor out the ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Let me make that equation:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) → (ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So:

(ΔE * (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but in the options, we're supposed to find an equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but in our equation, it's (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the options don't have any ΔE or k terms. So perhaps the options assume that the energy difference ΔE is the same, and perhaps some other terms are considered, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think again. The ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2.

Alternatively, the ratio of the excitation is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Because the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So R1 = 2 R2.

So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So 2 R2 = R1 → 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)) = (-ΔE/(k T1)).

Rearranging:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) ]

Which is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because 1/T1 - 1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / (T1 T2) )

Hmm, but the options don't have any ΔE or k. So perhaps that's the way it is, but the options don't include those terms. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: the excitation ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the populations is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So in star_1, the ratio is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Now, we're told that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So I think this refers to the ratio R1 = 2 R2.

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which is equivalent to:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But again, the options don't mention ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is looking for a relation between T1 and T2 based on the above equation, without including the energy term. Wait, but that's not possible unless ΔE/(k) is a given value, but the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me calculate what ΔE/(k) is.

The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k. So ΔE = k.

So if ΔE = k, then ΔE/(k) = 1.

So the equation becomes:

1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

Let me double-check. If ΔE = k, then our derived equation simplifies to option D.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct option is D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (denoted as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \)) based on the observed excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. In star_1, the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level is twice as much as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

In LTE, the population ratio of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For simplicity, the statistical weights are assumed to be the same for both stars, so the ratio of excitation depends only on the exponential term.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excitation are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
