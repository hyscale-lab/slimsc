Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to a hypothetical exoplanet in terms of the brightness variation they cause.

Alright, let me read the question again. The star has the same radius as the Sun, which is our host star. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, it causes periodic brightness changes. The situation mimics an exoplanet transit, so the question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness amplitude. Without the spots, I suppose.

So, the main idea is that the spots cause a dip in brightness when they face us, similar to a planet blocking the star's light. But in this case, the spots are causing the variation, but if a planet were doing it, what would its size have to be?

I remember that the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) depends on the area of the blocking object relative to the star's surface. For a planet transiting a star, the depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. But wait, in this case, it's not just one transit but a rotational modulation. So the star's brightness varies as spots rotate into and out of view.

But the problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, the effect is similar, but caused by spots instead. The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Wait, but the problem says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". Oh wait, no, it's the opposite. The spots are causing the variation, but we need to find the exoplanet radius that would produce the same signal as what the spots are doing. So, the amplitude caused by the spots is equal to that caused by the planet.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as: if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots is equal to the amplitude from a planet transit.

So I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the variation from a planet, then solve for Rp.

First, let's think about the brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's total brightness without any spots is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, so the total brightness dips when those spots face us.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is covered in spots. But each spot is cooler, at 5000 K (since the temperature difference is 1000 K). Wait, the problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. Oh wait, but the question says the spots have a temp difference of 1000 K. So I think it's T_spot = Teff - 1000 K? Because the star's Teff is 6000 K, so the spots are 5000 K. Because the spots are cooler, they emit less light.

So, the total flux when the star is unspotted is F0 = σTeff^4. But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * σT_spot^4.

Wait, the filling factor f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So, if the spots cover f=0.2 of the surface, then the total flux when the spots are facing us is F = F0*(1-f) + f*σT_spot^4. So the change in flux is ΔF = F - F0. That would be ΔF = F0*(1-f) + f*σT_spot^4 - F0 = F0*(1-f -1 ) + f*σT_spot^4 = - F0 *f + f*σT_spot^4 = f*(σT_spot^4 - F0).

Wait, but that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. The star's flux without any spots is F0 = 4πR²σTeff^4 / (4π) ) = σTeff^4, but wait, no, actually, the total luminosity is 4πR²σTeff^4. When a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots, the total flux would be L = (1 - f)* L0 + f * L_spot, where L0 is the luminosity per unit area for the rest of the star, and L_spot is the luminosity per unit area of the spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the flux change relative to the star's total flux. So when the spots are visible, part of the star is emitting less flux. The change in flux (ΔF) would be the difference between the spotted and unspotted flux.

So, the unspotted flux is F0 = σTeff^4. The spotted flux is F = (1-f)F0 + f * σT_spot^4. So the change in flux is ΔF = F - F0 = (1-f)F0 + f σT_spot^4 - F0 = -f F0 + f σT_spot^4 = f (σT_spot^4 - F0).

Then, the fractional change in flux (ΔF/F0) is [f (σT_spot^4 - F0)] / F0 = f ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) -1 )

Wait, but F0 = σ T_eff^4, so when you compute (σ T_spot^4) / F0 = T_spot^4 / Teff^4.

So the fractional change is f ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 )

Wait, but wait, since T_spot is lower than Teff, the term (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) is less than 1, so (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 is negative. Therefore, ΔF is negative, meaning the flux decreases when spots are visible. So the fractional change is negative, but the amplitude is the absolute value.

But wait, when the star is rotating, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. So the maximum dip in flux would be when the maximum area of spots is visible. But in this case, the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Since the star is rotating and we see one hemisphere, the maximum spot coverage is f=20%, but wait, no. The star has one hemisphere with spots, but when it's facing us, only part of that hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, the question says "only one hemisphere is spotty." So, the entire hemisphere is covered in spots, so when the star rotates so that this hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's away, we don't.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So a hemisphere is 50% of the surface. So if the hemisphere is fully covered in spots (filling factor for that hemisphere is 100%), but the total filling factor for the entire star is 20%. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the star's radius is same as Sun. One hemisphere (so half the surface) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20% of the star's total surface. So, the entire star's surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere (2πR²) has spots covering 20% of the entire surface. So spots cover 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8π R². So each hemisphere has 0.8π R² of spots. But since the star has two hemispheres, but only one is spotty, the other is unspotty.

Wait, no. Wait, the star has radius same as Sun. One hemisphere (so half) is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So, the total area covered by spots is 20% of the star's surface. So, the star's surface area is 4πR². 20% is 0.2 *4πR² = 0.8 π R². Since it's on one hemisphere, that's the entire surface of that hemisphere is spots? Wait, because one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20% of the star's entire surface. So, the other hemisphere is completely unspotted.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the visible hemisphere. Or is it 20% of the entire star?

Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's area. So, the area covered is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the spots on that hemisphere are 0.4 π R².

Now, when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots will block some light. But wait, the problem says that the spots are cooler, so when they face us, the brightness decreases because the spots are emitting less.

Wait, no. The spots are dark, so when they face us, the observed flux decreases. So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible. So the area of the spots facing us is 0.4 π R².

So the total flux from the star when the spots are fully visible is:

F = ( (Area_unspotted) * F_unspotted ) + (Area_spots * F_spots )

Area_unspotted = (Area of hemisphere) - (Area_spots) ) = (2π R²) - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

F_unspotted per unit area is σ Teff^4 (since that's the star's effective temperature).

F_spots per unit area is σ (Teff - 1000 K)^4 = σ (5000 K)^4.

But wait, the T_spot is Teff - 1000 K, so 5000 K.

So, the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without any spots (i.e., if the entire star was unspotted) is F0 = 4 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the fractional change ΔF/F0 would be (F - F0) / F0.

Let me compute F:

F = (1.6 π R² σ (6e3)^4 ) + (0.4 π R² σ (5e3)^4 )

F0 = 4 π R² σ (6e3)^4.

So,

F = [1.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] * π R² σ.

Divide F by F0:

F/F0 = [1.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] / (4*(6e3)^4 )

Let me compute each term.

Let me compute each term in terms of (6e3)^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So,

1.6 * 6000^4 = 1.6 * 1296e12 = 2073.6e12.

0.4 *5000^4 = 0.4 * 625e12 = 250e12.

So,

F = (2073.6e12 + 250e12) * π R² σ = 2323.6e12 * π R² σ.

F0 = 4 * 1296e12 * π R² σ = 5184e12 * π R² σ.

So F/F0 = 2323.6e12 / 5184e12 = 2323.6 / 5184.

Let me compute that.

2323.6 divided by 5184.

Hmm, 2323.6 / 5184 ≈ 0.4477.

So F is about 44.77% of F0? Wait, no, wait: F is the flux when spots are visible, but F0 is the total flux without any spots. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = 0.4477 * F0. So the dip is F0 - F = F0 (1 - 0.4477) = F0 * 0.5523.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when the star is fully unspotted, F0 is the flux. When the spots are visible, F is lower. So the fractional dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - (F/F0) = 1 - 0.4477 = 0.5523, or 55.23%.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if you have a big area of cooler spots, the dip should be significant, but 55% seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in F.

Wait, no. The F calculation: when the spots are visible, the star's flux is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area. The unspotted area is 1.6 π R², and the spotted is 0.4 π R². The factor is correct.

Wait, but let me think about it again. So the unspotted hemisphere (2 π R²) has 0.4 π R² covered by spots, so the unspotted area is 2 π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R². The spots are 0.4 π R².

So, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the star's flux is:

(1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The F0 is (4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

So, F/F0 is [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / [4*(6000^4)].

Let me compute this ratio numerically.

Compute numerator:

1.6*(6000^4) = 1.6 * (6^4 * 1e12) = 1.6 * 1296e12 = 2073.6e12.

0.4*(5000^4) = 0.4 * (5^4 * 1e12) = 0.4 * 625e12 = 250e12.

Total numerator: 2073.6e12 + 250e12 = 2323.6e12.

Denominator: 4 * 6000^4 = 4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So F/F0 = 2323.6e12 / 5184e12 = 2323.6 / 5184 ≈ 0.4477.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is about 44.77% of F0? That can't be right because the star's other hemisphere is also emitting. Wait, no. Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is on the far side and doesn't contribute to the flux we receive. So, when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere can face us, and the flux is F as calculated. When it's not facing us, the flux jumps back to F0.

Wait, wait, no. No, no. When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the unspotty hemisphere is facing us, and the flux is F0 again. So the dip is when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

So the dip amplitude is (F0 - F)/F0 = (1 - 0.4477) = 0.5523, about a 55% dip. That's a huge dip, but let's see.

Wait, but that can't be correct because 55% dip would require a very large spot coverage. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the flux calculation is not correct because the star's total flux is the sum of all surfaces. But when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Another approach is to calculate the fractional change in flux when the spots are in view.

The flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π) ) = σ Teff^4 * R². Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the flux is proportional to the sum of the areas times their respective fluxes.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. The change in flux when a spot is present is the difference between the unspotted flux and the spotted flux.

The flux from the unspotted star is F0 = (Area of star) * (σ Teff^4 ) / (4π * distance^2 ), but since we're dealing with relative changes, the distance doesn't matter.

The flux when spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (σ T_spot^4 / σ Teff^4 )

Wait, but that's assuming the entire surface is covered, which it's not. Alternatively, the approach I took earlier was correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² of spots is visible. But the star's surface is a sphere, so when a hemisphere is facing us, only the front half is visible. So, the spots on that hemisphere would block our view of the underlying star, but the star's other hemisphere (which is unspotty) is on the far side.

Wait, no. No, the star is a sphere. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we can see all of it. So, the spots covering 0.4 π R² (i.e., 20% of the star's surface) are in view. So the flux is calculated correctly as F = (1.6 π R²) * (σ Teff^4) + (0.4 π R²) * (σ T_spot^4). So my earlier calculation was correct.

But then the fractional dip is 55%, which is a big dip. So the question is: what exoplanet radius Rp would cause the same dip, which would be (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Because the dip from a planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the fractional dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So, if the dip from the spots is 55%, then the planet's dip would need to be 55%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.5523 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.5523) ≈ 0.743. But wait, but the options don't have anything near 0.7. The options are 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39. So that can't be right. That suggests I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but wait a minute. The brightness variation due to the spots isn't just when the spots are all visible. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into view over time. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot coverage is visible, which for a star with a single hemisphere covered, that would be when that hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is 55%, which is a big dip, but that's what we're seeing.

But if the exoplanet's dip is 55%, then Rp would be sqrt(0.55) * Rstar. Which is about 0.74 Rstar. So if the star's radius is R_sun, then Rp is about 0.74 R_sun. But that's way larger than any planet, let alone an exoplanet. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the temperature difference is causing the spots to be brighter or darker. Wait, the spots are cooler, so they are darker. So when they are in view, the flux decreases.

Wait, but perhaps the filling factor is only 20% for the hemisphere that's facing us when the spots are present. Or perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, but only half of the star's surface is visible at any time.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling factor. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. Since the star has two hemispheres, each hemisphere has 0.1 of the star's surface covered by spots. So, when the star is viewed from Earth, the maximum area of spots that can be seen is 0.2 of the star's surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots covering 0.2 of the star's surface are visible.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the maximum dip would be when all 0.2 of the star's surface (spots) is visible. So the calculation would be:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * ( (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

So f is 0.2.

So fractional dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) )

Because F = (1-f) F0 + f F_spot.

So (F0 - F) = F0 - [ (1-f) F0 + f F_spot ] = F0 - (1-f) F0 - f F_spot = f ( F0 - F_spot )

So (F0 - F)/F0 = f ( F0 - F_spot ) / F0 = f ( 1 - (F_spot / F0 ) )

F_spot is σ T_spot^4.

So F_spot / F0 = (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

So fractional dip is f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Ah, this seems better. So the formula is:

ΔF/F0 = f [ 1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 ]

So with f = 0.2, T_spot = 5000 K, Teff = 6000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

So ΔF/F0 ≈ 0.1035, or 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's more reasonable. So the dip is about 10.35% when the spots are fully visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is ~10.35%.

Now, for an exoplanet to produce the same amplitude, the dip should be the same. The dip from a planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

So,

(Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So Rp is approximately 0.32 times the star's radius.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the brightness dip caused by the spots and equate it to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 20\% = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta F / F_0 \)) when the spots are visible is given by:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.4823 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035
     \]
   - The fractional brightness dip is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - For a planet transiting the star, the fractional brightness dip is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Equate this to the brightness dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.

ANSWER: D
