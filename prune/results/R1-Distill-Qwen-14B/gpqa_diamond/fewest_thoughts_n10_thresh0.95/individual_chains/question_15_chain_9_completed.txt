Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, so they're similar in size, but their orbital periods and the host stars' properties are different. Let me break this down.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orbital distance. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, maybe? Or is it something else? Hmm. I think I might be mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, the transit probability formula I vaguely recall is P = (R_star / a) * (something else), where R_star is the radius of the star, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, no, that's the formula for the duration of the transit. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the probability.

I think the transit probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area relative to the star's disk. So the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else). Wait, no, maybe it's (R_planet / R_star) * (R_star / a) to get the chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. Alternatively, I think the approximate formula for the probability that a planet transits is (R_*/a) * (some term), but I'm not exactly sure. Another thought: the probability is highest when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us, but since the planets are detected via the radial velocity method, which doesn't require edge-on, but the probability is related to how likely the inclination is right for a transit.

Wait, the transit method's probability depends on the size of the planet and star, and the semi-major axis. The formula I think is P = (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / a), but I'm not confident. Or maybe it's more precise to think in terms of the impact parameter. Oh, wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block as seen from Earth, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_* / a) * (something). Wait, a more accurate approach: the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, that term is negligible. So approximately, P ≈ (R_* / a).

Wait, but actually, I think the transit probability P is given by (R_* / a) * (R_* / a) * something else. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look for the factors that affect the probability.

Wait, the probability is proportional to (R_*)/(a) multiplied by (R_*)/(R_p), but in reality, the exact formula is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + (R_p/R_* )) ), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, the R_p term is negligible. So maybe the probability is approximately (R_*)/(a), but wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path would cross the line of sight from Earth. It's actually based on the geometry. The probability that the planet's orbital plane is at the right inclination (edge-on) is (R_* / a) * (something else). Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) where b is the impact parameter, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability of a transit is about the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P ≈ (R_*/a). But that's the simplified version, right?

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is P = (R_* / a) * ( (R_* + R_p) / a )^(1/2) / (something?), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the factors that affect the probability without getting into the exact formula.

So, both planets have the same mass, but we are concerned with their transit probabilities. The key factors will be their orbital periods and the sizes of their stars.

Wait, the orbital period is given. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if P1 is the period of Planet_1, P2 = 3 P1.

Since both have circular orbits, the semi-major axis 'a' can be found using Kepler's third law. Remember that Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + m_p)) a³. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, it's approximated as P² = (4π²/(G M_*)) a³.

So, a is proportional to (P² M_*)^(1/3).

So let me compute a for each planet.

But wait, the problem gives the host star's mass. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.

So,

For Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2_star.

Wait, no, wait: the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2. So M1_star = 2 * M2_star.

And both have the same radius. So R1_star = R2_star = R.

Also, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no, the question says: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's period is P/3.

Now, using Kepler's third law, a = [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1:

a1 = [ (G * M1 * P1²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Similarly, a2 = [ (G * M2 * P2²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2, substituting:

a1 = [ (G * (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)
= [ (G M2 P2² (2) (1/9) ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) * (G M2 P2²/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) * [ (G M2 P2²/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3)
But [ (G M2 P2²/(4 π²)) ) ]^(1/3) is exactly a2.

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Wait, what is (2/9)^(1/3)? 2 is 8^(1/3) is 2, but 9 is 8.1? Wait, 9 is 3^2, so cube root of (2/(3²)) = cube_root(2)/cube_root(9) = cube_root(2)/(3^(2/3)).

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to compute the ratio a1 / a2.

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) ) = 2^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)) )

Alternatively, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08, so the ratio is approximately 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. That makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star, so it's closer in.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_star / a). Because, as I thought earlier, P ≈ (R/a) (but I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed with that assumption for the sake of this problem.)

Wait, but I should think about what the transit probability formula actually is. The correct formula for the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_* / a) * ( (R_p + R_*) / R_* ) ), but R_p is much smaller than R_*, so it's approximately (R_* / a).

Wait, alternatively, the transit probability is roughly (R*/a) * (1 + R_p / R_* ), but since R_p<<R_*, it's approximately (R*/a).

Wait, but another source says the probability is given by (R_* + R_p)/a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_*/a) * ( (R_*)/(a) ), but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a)² * (some factor). Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, I found that the probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit (from the perspective of Earth). So the probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2.

Wait, if that's the case, then the probability P is approximately (R_*/a)^2.

Because the area is π R_*², and the area of the planet's orbit (which is a circle with radius a) is π a². So the probability would be (R_*/a)^2. But wait, that's the fraction of the orbit where a transit would occur, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability might be (R_*/(a)) * (something else), but perhaps the correct approach is to use (R_*/a) as the probability.

Wait, let me think again. When the planet's orbit is edge-on, we can observe the transit. The condition for a transit is that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this is approximately (R_*/a), because that's the ratio of the star's size to the distance the planet is from us. So the chance that the planet's position during transit is within the line of sight is proportional to (R_*/a).

Alternatively, the formula I've seen is P ≈ (R_*/a) * ( (R_*) / (a) ) )—no, that's a square. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me perhaps look up the correct formula (but since I can't, I have to proceed with what I think is right).

Assuming the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) × (R_p / R_* ), but since R_p is much smaller, perhaps it's just (R_p / a). But no, that would make the probability smaller as a increases. Hmm, wait, maybe it's (R_* / a), because if a is smaller, the star appears larger, so higher probability.

Given that, the probability P is proportional to (R_* / a).

Now, since both stars have the same radius, R_1 = R_2 = R.

So, for each planet, P1 and P2, their probabilities are (R/a1) and (R/a2).

But since a1 = 0.606 a2, then P1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.65 * P2.

Wait, because if a1 is smaller than a2, then R/a1 is larger than R/a2, so P1 is higher.

Wait, so P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2).

Since a1 is about 0.606 a2, so a2 is larger than a1 by 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65 times. So R/(a1) is 1.65 times R/(a2).

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/(a1)) / (R/(a2)) ) = a2/(a1) ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, so the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which seems higher than our calculation.

Wait, but wait a minute—I think I might have made a mistake in the a1/a2 ratio.

Let me recalculate a1 and a2 using the correct Kepler's third law. Let me write it properly.

Kepler's third law: (P^2 * G M_*) / (4 π²) = a^3.

So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But for our purposes, we can consider it as a ~ (M_* P² )^(1/3).

So for Planet_1:

M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2) * (P2² / 3² ) )^(1/3)

= (2 * (P2²/9) * M2 )^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 )

Which is (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) )

9^(1/3) = (3^2)^(1/3) = 3^(2/3) ≈ 2.08.

2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

So a1/a2 ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So when I compute P1 and P2, which are R/(a1) and R/(a2) respectively.

So P1 = R / (0.606 a2) = (1 / 0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2).

Which is 1.65 times P2.

So the probability of transit for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers would choose Planet_1 because it's more probable to transit.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: 2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transit probability formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are inversely proportional to a, but perhaps including other factors.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / (a) multiplied by (1 + (R_* / a)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is ( (R_* + R_p) / a )^2.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a) * (R_p / R_*) ) * ... Hmm, no, I think I should stick with the earlier calculation.

Wait, other possibility: the transit probability is actually (R_* / a) * (some function of the impact parameter), but perhaps for a uniform distribution of impact parameters, the probability is (R_* / a) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (R_*/a) ) = (R_*/a)^2.

Wait, but that would make the probability proportional to (R_*/a)^2, which would change the ratio.

Let me see:

If P is proportional to (R_*/a)^2, then P1/P2 = (a2/ a1)^2.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. Squared is 2.72. So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

Wait, that's what option D states: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Hmm, so which is correct? Does the transit probability scale with (R_*/a) or (R_*/a)^2?

I think I need to clarify the correct formula for the transit probability.

Upon reflection, I think the correct transit probability is given by:

P = (R_* / a) * (R_* / a) ) * (something else?), or perhaps it's (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_* )) ), but again R_p is much smaller than R_*, so perhaps it's (R_*/a).

Wait, no—another approach. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the circle you're looking at (the planet's orbit from Earth's perspective). The area of the star is π R_*^2, the area of the orbit is π a^2. So the probability would be (R_* / a)^2. Because the area ratio is (R_*^2)/(a^2) = (R_* /a )^2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability is (R_* / a)^2.

So, in that case, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2.

Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R, so the probability for each planet is (R/a1)^2 and (R/a2)^2.

So, the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

Earlier, we found that a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So Planet_1's probability is about 2.72 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers would prefer Planet_1. Looking at the options, option D says 2.7 times, which matches this.

So earlier, when I thought the probability was proportional to (R/a), I got a 1.65 ratio, but if it's (R/a)^2, it's 2.7 times.

Which is correct?

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight. The relative size of the star from Earth's perspective is R/a. So the chance that a planet transits is the area of the star divided by the area of the orbit. The area of the star is π R^2, the area of the orbit (as seen edge-on) is π a^2. So the probability is (R/a)^2.

Ah, yes! So indeed, the probability is (R/a)^2.

So in this case, since Planet_1's a is smaller, (R/a) is larger, so (R/a)^2 is larger.

So, considering that, P1 = (R/a1)^2 and P2 = (R/a2)^2.

We have a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a1 = 0.606 a2 --> a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 = approximately 2.72.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2.

Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability, and the correct option is D: ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the probability was (R/a), I thought the ratio was 1.65, but now with (R/a)^2, it's 2.7.

So what's the correct approach?

Yes, the transit probability is indeed (R/a)^2. Because the area of the star is π R^2, and the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth is π a^2. So the probability is the ratio of these areas, which is (R/a)^2.

So, the correct ratio is (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.7.

So the correct answer is option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to the square of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance: 

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

Here, \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2 = R\)), the probability depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_* \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2: \(M_1 = 2M_2\).
- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\).

Substituting these values:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Calculating \(\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}\):
\[
\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While Planet_1 is preferred, the probability ratio is not 1.65.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 2.7.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a transit probability approximately 2.7 times higher than Planet_2.

**Answer: D**
