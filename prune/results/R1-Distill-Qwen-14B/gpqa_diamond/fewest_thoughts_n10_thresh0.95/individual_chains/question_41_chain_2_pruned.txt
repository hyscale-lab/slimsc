Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass, which is itself moving. The glass has an index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to recall some basic physics about the speed of light in different media and how motion of the medium affects it.

I remember that when light travels through a medium with refractive index n, its speed slows down to v = c/n. So in the glass, the speed of light would normally be 1/n because c is 1 here.

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

I'm a bit fuzzy on how relative velocities add up here. Oh right, I think it's about relative velocity addition, but wait—that's usually in the context of special relativity. Wait, but velocities are involved here. So perhaps I should consider the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, but the velocity of light in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, say at velocity u, how does that affect the observed speed of light in that medium from the lab frame?

Wait, another approach: maybe we can think of the speed of light in the glass as seen from the lab. So from the lab's frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (and the light is too, same direction). So the question is, what's the speed of the light as measured in the lab frame.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving, so we have to consider the velocity of the light in the glass's frame and then transform it to the lab frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n. Let's denote this as v_g = 1/n.

Now, since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when you're moving from one frame to another. So in this case, the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = v_g = 1/n. So to find u' in the lab frame (which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass frame), we plug into the formula.

Wait, no, the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame? Or is the glass moving at v relative to the lab? I think it's the latter. So the lab frame sees the glass moving at v.

Wait, let's make it clearer. Let me set the lab frame as S, and the glass frame as S'. S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, in the same direction as the light.

In S', the light's velocity is u’ = v_g = 1/n.

We want to find the velocity u of the light in S (lab frame), using the Lorentz transformation.

The formula is u = [u’ + v] / [1 + (u’ v)/c²]

Since c=1, this simplifies to u = (u’ + v) / (1 + u’ v).

Substituting u’ = 1/n,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Hmm, let's factor that. Let's factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So when you divide them, the n's cancel out. So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the signs. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction
