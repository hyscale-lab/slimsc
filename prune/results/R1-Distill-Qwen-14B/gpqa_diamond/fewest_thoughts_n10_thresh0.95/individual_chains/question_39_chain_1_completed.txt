Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function given certain conditions.

Alright, the wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics are supposed to be normalized. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

Wait, but the wave function has an imaginary component here. Oh right, because of the '-0.5i' term. So I need to compute the absolute square of this function. Let's write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). So the absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), which is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts are conjugates, their product is (0.5)^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. ψ(x) is a real part plus an imaginary part. So ψ = A + iB, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is -0.5. Then ψ* is A - iB. So ψ*ψ is (A^2 + B^2). Because when you multiply (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + iAB - iAB - i² B² = A² + B² (since i² is -1, so -i² is +1). So yeah, |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1. Because the wave function must be normalized.

Let me write that integral as:

Integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

I can split this into two separate integrals:

a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 3-1=2. So 0.25 *2=0.5.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is roughly 0.5/0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a squared is about 0.721, which means a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.721). Hmm, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85 because 0.85² is 0.7225. So sqrt(0.721) is a bit less, maybe around 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's likely the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Did I get the setup right?

Wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when I take the absolute square, it's [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (i0.5)^2 is (i)^2 (0.5)^2. But wait, no, the absolute square is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So yes, correct.

So the integral setup is correct. Then the calculations: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213.

a= sqrt(0.7213) ≈ sqrt(0.7225) = 0.85. So the answer is 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

   So, the first term becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 3 - 1 = 2
   \]

   So, the second term becomes:
   \[
   0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5
   \]

Combining the two terms, the normalization condition is:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of "a" is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
