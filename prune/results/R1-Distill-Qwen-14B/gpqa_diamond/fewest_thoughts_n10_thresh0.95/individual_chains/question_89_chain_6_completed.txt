Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves some reaction steps and NMR analysis. I'll take it step by step.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, pretty rigid. 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. 

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with strong bases, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are separated by one carbon. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but let me think. Oh wait, when you have two bromines on non-adjacent carbons, heating with a strong base can lead to elimination as well, but maybe it's a different pathway. Or perhaps it's more of an E2 elimination.

Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the structure is such that when both bromides are removed, an alkene forms. But wait, let's think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an OCH2 group. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H) which might be the adamantane ring's protons. 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another set of protons, maybe from an ether or adjacent to oxygen.

The IR spectrum has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), like an ester or ketone. So product 1 might be an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone? Wait, no. If the product has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an elimination product. Wait, when dihalides undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But the carbonyl suggests something else. Oh, maybe the base is causing an elimination but in a different manner. Alternatively, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution and elimination.

Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide is being converted into a glycol. But that would involve adding water, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, but with two bromides, perhaps leading to a ring-opening or forming a double bond within the adamantane structure.

Wait, the presence of a carbonyl suggests that maybe elimination isn't the only thing happening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an epoxide, but that doesn't fit. Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with strong bases, sometimes they can form ketones if the structure allows for elimination in a way that forms a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. It's a four-fused cyclohexane rings, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite ends of the structure.

Heating with KOH could cause the two bromides to eliminate, but since they're not adjacent, perhaps each bromide is eliminated separately. But if each Br leaves, you would get two E2 eliminations, but that's not possible because each elimination would require a hydrogen on a neighboring carbon. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond, but with two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur, leading to a conjugated diene? But then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't make sense with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an ether. Wait, the NMR has an OCH2 group. So maybe the product is an epoxide. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, if the 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two dehydrohalogenation reactions, each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group? But that would give a diol, but then where's the carbonyl? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the elimination of HBr from each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that can undergo elimination to form a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure.

In adamantane, each carbon is part of the diamondoid structure. So if two adjacent carbons (but not vicinal, since 1 and 3 are separated by one carbon) have Br, perhaps when they lose HBr, the adjacent carbons form double bonds or carbonyls.

Wait another approach: the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something like an epoxide, which is often a solid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let me think about the NMR. The peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H suggests a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. So perhaps an ether, like an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a strained ring, they could be higher. Alternatively, if it's an OCH2 group, maybe it's part of an ester or an ether.

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl (IR at 1720), perhaps it's an ester or ketone. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let me think, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide with an adjacent carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing the 1,3-dibromoadamantane to eliminate both Br atoms and form a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, and elimination forms a ketone. So when two Brs are eliminated, each adjacent to bridgeheads, perhaps the structure forms two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. The IR wouldn't show a carbonyl in that case. So maybe I'm wrong about what the product is.

Wait, the IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, probably an ester or ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Maybe through a double elimination, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require two eliminations to form two carbonyls, but that's not possible because each elimination would form a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that leads to the formation of a ketone via elimination. For example, if each Br is on a tertiary carbon, and elimination leads to a carbonyl. But wait, in adamantane, the carbons are all bridgehead carbons, which are typically quaternary. So each Br is on a bridgehead, which is a quaternary carbon. Elimination from a quaternary carbon? That doesn't make sense because E2 requires a hydrogen on a beta carbon, but if the carbon is quaternary, there's no H to abstract. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine on two non-adjacent bridgeheads. So each Br is on a bridgehead carbon.

If each bridgehead has a Br, then elimination would require H's on adjacent carbons. But bridgehead carbons are quaternary, so no H's attached. So elimination via E2 isn't possible. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Perhaps a substitution reaction. But with KOH, a strong base, substitution is less likely unless it's SN2, but for bridgehead substitution, which is difficult because the structure is rigid and the backside attack is hindered.

Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides undergo elimination, but given the structure, maybe forming a bridgehead double bond? But I don't think that's feasible in adamantane.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms an oxide. If KOH removes HBr from each bridgehead, perhaps forming an oxide bridge. But then how would that look?

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but how would that happen? An epoxide would require the formation of an oxygen bridge between the two carbons. But with KOH, which is a base, perhaps it's not the right reagent.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the next reaction to get more clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, product 1's structure: based on the NMR and IR, it probably has a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a ketone or ester, and then treated with Al(iPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, maybe it's undergoing an acylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 could be a diol. Because sometimes, dihalides can be hydrolyzed to diols. But if that's the case, the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl. So I'm back to thinking that product 1 has a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide with an adjacent carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the reaction with Al isopropoxide is a Friedel-Crafts, but since adamantane is already a polycyclic structure, perhaps it's being functionalized.

Alternatively, I might have to think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, then treated with dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them and forming carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the series of reactions is as follows:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH forms an epoxide (product 1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then, how would KOH form an epoxide? Usually, epoxide formation is via treatment with a base and an oxidizing agent, like H2O2 in basic conditions. But KOH alone might not form an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a double bond, but then what about the IR carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the IR and NMR together.

Product 1's IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O). NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H, maybe OCH2). The other peaks are probably the adamantane ring protons.

So, product 1 is likely an ester or a ketone. But with OCH2, maybe it's an ether. Wait, OCH2 could be part of an epoxide, but in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is part of an ester group, like R-O-CO-O-R. No, that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a glycol ester? Hmm.

Wait, another angle: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH might undergo elimination to form a cyclic ether via an E2 mechanism. But again, I'm not sure how that would form with the given NMR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe the product is an allyl-type structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure how that would form from elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, replacing Br with OH groups, but then the IR would show broad O-H peaks, which aren't mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an ether. For example, if each Br is replaced by an OR group. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak for C-O, but it does show a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but again, that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm... Maybe I should think about the second reaction.

Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylated product. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure, which is electron-deficient, so maybe it undergoes some alkylation or acylation.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is used to open it. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetylated adamantane. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 3 indicates a coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen. So perhaps the structure of product 3 is a diol or has some alkenes or carbonyl groups that cause the protons to couple in a particular way.

But let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a carbonyl group, possibly a ketone or ester)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (heated with Al isopropoxide), which has a double bond.
3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis, which breaks the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, step 2 must involve the formation of a double bond. How does product 1, which has a carbonyl, lead to product 2 with a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide?

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Maybe product 1 is a carbonyl compound, and Al isopropoxide is used to form an enol ether or facilitate some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, which is already highly substituted, maybe it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or forming a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is causing it to lose water and form an alkene via an E1 or E2 mechanism, forming product 2 as an alkene.

Wait, that makes sense. So let's go back.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1, which is a diol (1,3-diol), perhaps? Wait, but earlier I thought that elimination would form an alkene, but maybe substitution occurs here.

Wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes two SN2 substitutions, but at bridgehead positions, which are not feasible for SN2 because of the structure. So elimination is more likely.

Wait, but if the molecule can't eliminate (because bridgehead H's are unavailable), maybe it undergoes substitution via an SN1 mechanism? But SN1 requires a stable carbocation, which bridgehead carbons can't form easily. So I'm back to being stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is not acting on the dibromide but perhaps deprotonating something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone. If the 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would require two substitutions, which seems unlikely. But perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation for each Br, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, and elimination forms a carbonyl. For example, each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, would form a carbonyl group. So the product would be a diketone.

The NMR would then show the carbonyl as the IR peak. The 4.79 ppm peak (2H) would be from something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group, as in an ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, with no OCH2 group. But the NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which might be an OCH2 group, perhaps part of an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a gem-dialkoxide, which upon workup gives a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, and the NMR shows that. Let me think about that again.

Epoxide protons typically appear around 3-4 ppm, but in a strained ring, maybe higher. The 4.79 ppm peak could be part of the epoxide. But then the IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which isn't present in an epoxide. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonyl with an adjacent epoxide. That is, an epoxide connected to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if KOH is causing some kind of saponification. But that would require ester groups to begin with, which the starting material doesn't have.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach the problem differently. Let's think about the entire process.

After ozonolysis, product 3's NMR shows a certain coupling pattern. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is likely to be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl group. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded and show specific coupling patterns.

But wait, ozonolysis of a symmetric double bond would give a single product, but if the double bond is asymmetric, it might give different products.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, leading to a complex coupling pattern.

Alternatively, if the double bond in product 2 is part of a ring, ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Let's say product 2 has a double bond in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break that, leading to two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have two carbonyls, and the hydrogens next to them would couple with neighboring Hs.

The coupling pattern would depend on the number of neighboring Hs. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, it might split into a triplet. But if it's adjacent to two different sets, perhaps more complex splitting.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is likely near the carbonyl. So, perhaps each of these protons is next to a CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis step. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The product would then have two new carbonyl groups. The hydrogens adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded and would show specific coupling.

Suppose in product 2, the double bond is between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would cleave to form two carbonyls, each attached to a CH2 group. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have their protons split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would be the ones attached directly to the carbonyl. Wait, no, because the carbonyl is adjacent to the CH2. Let me think.

Alternatively, if the double bond in product 2 is between two CH groups, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls attached to CH groups. Then, those CH groups would have their protons split by neighboring Hs.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Deshielded implies near electronegative groups like oxygen or carbonyl. So perhaps these protons are next to carbonyl groups.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, each end has a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is R-CO-R', and each R has some protons.

If the structure is something like CH2-CO-CH2-, but that's a simple case. Alternatively, if the structure has more complex branching.

Wait, considering the initial structure and the reactions, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or a diepoxide. 

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond, which is cleaved into carbonyls.

Assuming product 2 has a trans double bond, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups on either end. The coupling in the NMR would depend on the structure.

If each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, the protons on those CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl and would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl would have two protons. Those protons would be split by neighboring Hs. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the coupling could be a triplet, as each proton is next to two equivalent protons.

But wait, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 next to CO would have each H coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would give a triplet.

But the question says, "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)". So perhaps the most deshielded is the one closest to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure after ozonolysis leads to protons that are coupled with more than two neighbors.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond, but wait, product 2 has only one double bond, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 has two carbonyl groups, each attached to some CH2 groups or other structures.

If the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2, then the protons on the first CH2 (next to CO) would couple with the next CH2's protons.

In that case, each H on the CH2 adjacent to CO would see two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH2 next to CO is adjacent to another CH2, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, which would split into a triplet.

But wait, in that scenario, each H on the first CH2 would have coupling with two H on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H. So perhaps that H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and it's coupled to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But the options include triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis leads to each H being coupled with two sets of Hs. For example, if each CH2 is between two different sets of Hs, that could lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the H is adjacent to two different types of Hs. For example, if the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-..., then each H on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2 and perhaps another coupling elsewhere.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. 

Wait, let's think about the initial steps again. Maybe product 1 is a diepoxide. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, and Al isopropoxide facilitates elimination to form a double bond, making product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, making product 3 a diketone or similar.

If product 2 is an alkene in a position that, upon ozonolysis, forms two carbonyls, then product 3 would have those groups. The most deshielded Hs would be adjacent to those carbonyls.

Assuming each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, the Hs on those CH2s would be deshielded. Each H would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So in product 3, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet. Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet, so that's the likely answer.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests an OCH₂ group. The other peaks correspond to the adamantane ring protons.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is likely a ketone or an ester with a carbonyl group and an OCH₂ group.

2. **Reaction with Al(iPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(iPr)₃), a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the formation of a double bond in product 2.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it contains a double bond that will be cleaved in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby protons.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and is coupled with protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is split into a triplet due to coupling with the two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - Therefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
