Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity and metrics. Hmm, the question provides a metric and asks for the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, I need to think about what a pseudosphere is in this context. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic sphere.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only involving dx and dy. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the denominator must be positive because the metric is under a square root or something, so the area would be integrated over where the denominator is positive. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. That means we're dealing with a region inside a circle of radius 2, right? Because sqrt(x² + y²) < 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which is more like a hyperbolic plane's "sphere") can be different. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the metric given is for a hyperbolic space?

Let me think. The given metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

This looks a bit like the metric for the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk has a metric given by (ds)^2 = [4 / (1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular coordinate. But wait, in the given metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So maybe if I make a substitution u = x/(2), v = y/(2), then x² + y² = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4(u² + v²). So the denominator becomes 4(1 - (u² + v²)). Then the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4(1 - (u² + v²)))] ( (2 du)^2 + (2 dv)^2 )
Wait, no. Wait, x = 2u, y = 2v, so dx = 2 du, dy = 2 dv. So dx² + dy² = 4 (du² + dv²). So substituting into the metric:

ds² = [32/(4 - (4u² +4v²))] * 4 (du² + dv²)
= [32/(4(1 - (u² + v²)))] * 4 (du² + dv²)
= [32/(4(1 - (u² + v²)))]*4 (du² + dv²)
= [8/(1 - (u² + v²))] (du² + dv²)

Wait, that's [8/(1 - (u² + v²))](du² + dv²). Hmm, but the standard Poincaré disk metric is [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), which is different. So maybe the given metric isn't exactly the standard Poincaré model. Or perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps it's a conformally flat metric. Conformally flat means it's just a scaling of the Euclidean metric. So the line element is conformally equivalent to the flat metric. So the area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy.

The metric tensor is diagonal with components [32/(4 - x² - y²), 32/(4 - x² - y²)]. So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². The area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, no: the metric is diag(A, A), so determinant is A^2. So sqrt(det g) is A, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the metric is written as ds² = A (dx² + dy²), where A is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor g has components g_xx = A, g_yy = A, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. The determinant of g is then A*A - 0 = A². So the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is A dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. Since g_xy =0, it's sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy = sqrt(A^2) dx dy = A dx dy.

So area is the integral of A dx dy over the region where A is positive, which is where 4 - x² - y² >0, so x² + y² <4.

So the area would be the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, maybe the pseudosphere here refers to a surface in this metric. Or perhaps it's a 2D surface embedded in this space with constant curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe it's about the area of the region x² + y² <4 in this metric.

Wait, but pseudospheres in 2D? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is more like an abstract concept, but perhaps it's a surface with constant negative curvature. The given metric is a hyperbolic metric, perhaps.

Wait, the area of the entire space (i.e., where x² + y² <4) in this metric. So the area would be ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, over x² + y² <4.

To compute this, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that.

So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Compute this:

First, take out the constants: 32 * ∫θ ∫r [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr dθ.

The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, so it's 2π. So Area = 32 * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution: let u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (u=4 to 0) [ ( - du/2 ) / u ] = ∫ (0 to4) [ (du/2) / u ] = (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

But ∫(1/u) du from 0 to4 is ln u evaluated from 0 to4, which is ln4 - ln0. Wait, ln0 is negative infinity. That means the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check.

The integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to2.

Let u=4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral is ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ 1/u ] (-du/2 ) → ∫ (from u=4 to 0) [ - (1/u)(du/2) ] → ∫ (from 4 to0) (-1/(2u)) du.

Which is the same as ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/(2u)) du.

So ∫ (1/(2u)) du from 0 to4 is (1/2)(ln u) evaluated from 0 to4. As u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches -infinity, so the integral becomes (1/2)( ln4 - (-infty) ) → infinity.

So the area is 32 * 2π * (infinite) → infinite.

So the area is infinite. But wait, the options given are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the area is infinite, so option D.

Wait, but why? Because for a hyperbolic plane, the area is indeed infinite. Like, in hyperbolic geometry, the entire plane has infinite area. So the given metric is perhaps a representation of hyperbolic 2D space, and the area within radius 2 would be the entire
