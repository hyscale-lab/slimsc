Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. The key thing is that these operators are supposed to be invariant under the same symmetries as the SM. So whatever symmetries the SM has, SMEFT must respect too, right?

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SM is Lorentz invariant. SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars. Because if the operators weren't Lorentz scalars, they'd break Lorentz symmetry, which the SM respects. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT must too. Wait, but in SMEFT, do all terms automatically respect Poincare? Because the field theory framework generally enforces Poincare invariance. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait a second. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, but when you add higher-dimension operators, do they automatically respect Poincare? I think yes, because the operators are written in terms of the SM fields, which themselves are Poincare invariant. So the higher-dimension terms are built from SM fields and their derivatives, which are Poincare invariant. So Poincare is respected.

3. CP symmetry: The SM doesn't have a CP symmetry necessarily at the fundamental level. In fact, CP violation exists in the SM (like in the CKM matrix). So SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP symmetry. Wait, but wait. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry isn't a part of the SM, then SMEFT doesn't need to preserve it. So operators in SMEFT might or might not respect CP, depending on the operator, but the point is that they don't have to. So not all SMEFT operators must respect CP. So option 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT symmetry. So any effective theory that extends the SM must also respect CPT. Because if the SM respects CPT, and the SMEFT is just adding higher-dimension terms built from SM fields, then the entire theory must respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

So putting it together, which of the options must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz: yes.

2. Poincare: yes.

3. CP: no.

4. CPT: yes.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4.

Option D says 1,3,4.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Does Poincare symmetry include Lorentz? Because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But in the question, it's asking which symmetries must be respected. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or just Poincare, which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the question lists them as separate options. So the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry. Because both are part of the SM's symmetry. So yes, both 1 and 2 are required.

So the answer includes 1,2,4. So option C is correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that incorporates higher-dimensional operators while maintaining the same symmetries as the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincar√©
