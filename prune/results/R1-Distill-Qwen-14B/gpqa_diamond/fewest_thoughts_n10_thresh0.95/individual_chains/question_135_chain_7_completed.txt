Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, the notation might be a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So the interaction term is proportional to ψ̄_f (y) times X(y) times ψ_f(y), I think. Because the other term is (ν + X(y)), but I'm not sure what ν represents here. Maybe it's a constant or another field? Or perhaps it's a typo, maybe it's a mass term?

Wait, the problem is about the decay of the boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So I'm trying to find which fermion pairs it can decay into.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would carry away some energy, and the rest mass must be sufficient. So for a decay X → f f̄, the condition is m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

But wait, which fermions are available? The fermions that X can interact with. The given Lagrangian has ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So the interaction term is L = ... X ψ̄ ψ, so X couples to fermions f.

Looking at the interaction term, I think the coupling is to all the fermion types present in the Standard Model, unless specified otherwise. But perhaps the problem is more about the allowed decays based on mass.

Wait, the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2m_f ≤ m_X =6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV).

Let me list the fermion masses approximately:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV
Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, so for each fermion f, m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's check each possible fermion:

- e: yes, 0.0005 GeV → 2m_e is ~0.001 GeV <6 GeV.
- μ: 0.105 → 2m ~0.21 <6 → yes.
- τ: 1.777 → 2*1.777=3.554 GeV. Oh wait, 3.554 is less than 6 GeV? No, 3.554 is less than 6. So yes, τ can be produced.

Wait wait, wait a second. Because m_X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f must be ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV. So let me recalculate:

X can decay into f f̄ if m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV?

e: yes.
μ: yes, since 0.105 <3.
τ: 1.777 <3 → yes.
u: 0.0035 <3 → yes.
d: 0.005 → yes.
s: 0.095 → yes.
c: 1.27 <3 → yes.
b: 4.1 >3 → no.
t: way too heavy.

So the possible fermions f are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and the quark pairs: uū, dđ, sš, cč.

Wait, but wait about the quarks. The problem is about allowed decays, but in reality, for quarks, you can't have free quarks; they have to be in hadrons. But in the context of this problem, since the Lagrangian is given, perhaps it's assuming that X can couple to quarks, and in the decay X → q q̄, but since quarks are confined, perhaps the decay is into a pair of quarks, but in reality, it would hadronize into jets. But for the purpose of this question, perhaps we're only concerned about the kinematics, not whether the decay products are observed as free particles.

So the allowed fermion pairs are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b, s, etc. Wait, option A includes b. But the mass of b is about 4.1 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So 2m_b would be 8.2 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄. So option A includes b which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So the fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom and top. So B's decay products are correct. Because all these fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait the options:

Option A: includes b and s, u, d, tau, e+. So A is X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, e+ e-. But since m_b is 4.1 GeV, 2*4.1=8.2>6, so this decay is not kinematically allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. All these fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV, so their 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So B is possible.

But wait, what about the top quark? Oh, it's not in any of the options, so no problem. So the correct allowed decays are those in B.

Wait, but looking again, the options:

Option B says "c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e". So that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom quark.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( X \to f \bar{f} \)), the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. This ensures that the energy required to produce the fermion-antifermion pair is available.

### Step 1: Identify fermion masses
The approximate masses of Standard Model fermions are:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Step 2: Determine allowed fermions
For \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). From the list above:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \): All have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so these decays are allowed.
- \( b, t \): Both have \( m_f > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so these decays are not allowed.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b = 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \). All these fermions have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^{+} \tau^{-}, \mu^{+} \mu^{-}, e^{+} e^{-} \), as listed in **Option B**.
