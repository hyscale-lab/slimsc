Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, the Kf is given as 5e10.

The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So if the complex is dissociating, how much Ca²+ will be present?

But wait, the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, without considering any dissociation, all the Ca would be tied up in the complex. But because the Kf is so large, the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be small. But wait, no, actually, Kf is the formation constant, which is the tendency to form the complex. A large Kf means the complex is favored, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) is not favored. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, no, that's not right. Kf is the equilibrium for formation, so a large Kf (like 5e10) means that the complex is highly favored. So the majority of the Ca is in the complex form. Therefore, the free Ca²+ concentration should be very low.

But how do I calculate it?

I think the formula involves the dissociation of the complex. Let me write the dissociation equation:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So the dissociation constant, Kd, would be the reciprocal of Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the dissociation as the reverse of the formation.

So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-; Kf = 5e10.

The reverse reaction is the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2- → Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, given that Kd is very small (2e-11), x would be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plug into the Kd expression:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, no. Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = (2 * 2) * 1e-13 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, since 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 would be around 6.32e-7. Hmm, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 4e-13 under the square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me make sure I haven't made a mistake in any step. Let me go through again.

- The problem states that [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. So initial concentration is 0.02 M.

- The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

- Let x be the amount dissociated.

- Therefore, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, [complex] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

- Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

- Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 2e-13 * 2? Wait wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

Wait, 2e-11 * 2e-2 = (2 * 2) * 1e-13 = 4e-13.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 exponent is in between.

Alternatively, 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) → because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Which matches option C: 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at 25°C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) that dissociates from the complex. At equilibrium:
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\),
- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M).

Substituting into the expression for \( K_d \):

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[CaEDTA^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
