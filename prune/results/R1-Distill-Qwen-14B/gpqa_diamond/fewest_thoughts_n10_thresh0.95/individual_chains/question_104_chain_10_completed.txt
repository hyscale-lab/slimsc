Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, both stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each star has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So their masses are about the same, and the stars are identical. The planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The question gives me the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for each star. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, what do these shifts mean again?

Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star (which relates to the period via Kepler's laws).

Wait, but Kepler's third law might come into play here. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like v = (2π G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) * c ) ), but I might be mixing up some parts. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) ... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Because the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune-sized planets), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K ≈ (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But since in this problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of the velocities would depend on the cube root of the inverse of their orbital periods. Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), right? So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 / M_p1) * ... but since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, the ratio simplifies to K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait no, let's write the equation correctly. Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)), and if M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. If K1 is for planet 1, then K1 = constant * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = constant * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = [ (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So rearranging, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

So the question is, K is given as the shift for each star. Wait, the problem says planet #1's spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's is 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

Wait, but wait, the shift is inversely proportional to the period. Because K1 is smaller than K2, which would imply that P2 is smaller than P1? Or wait, no.

Wait, because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so if K1 < K2, that would mean that P1 > P2.

Wait, let me plug in numbers. Let me write the ratio:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Given K1=5, K2=7 → 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364 → P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question asks "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?" So it's the ratio P2/P1. So from above, it's approximately 0.364 times.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the ratio correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that a larger K implies a shorter period. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so higher K → shorter P.

So planet 2 has a higher K (7) than planet 1 (5), meaning planet 2 has a shorter period. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1, so the question is how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1, which is 0.364 as I got.

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.36, meaning planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but the question is "How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is shorter, so it's not longer. Hmm, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

The question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1." So P2 is longer? But according to the calculation, P2 is shorter. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, maybe I inverted the ratio. Let me re-examine.

We have:

K1 = 5, K2=7.

But K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no: Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So when K1 < K2 → (P2/P1)^(1/3 ) < 1 → P2 < P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So if someone were to ask how many times longer planet #2's period is than planet #1's, the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is actually shorter. But the question is phrased as "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1." So if it's 0.36 times, that would mean it's 36% of the period of planet #1. So it's shorter, but the question is about how many times longer.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for P2 / P1, regardless of whether it's shorter or longer. Because the options are given as A) ~0.36, which would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2 pi G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Assuming that sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum detectability, and probably assumed here), and M_p is same for both, then K ∝ 1 / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Because M_star is same for both stars, so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So rearranged, P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, no: K1 = C / P1^(1/3 )

K2 = C / P2^(1/3 )

Divide K1 by K2: (C / P1^(1/3 )) / (C / P2^(1/3 )) ) = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So then, (K1/K2 )^3 = ( P2 / P1 )

So, P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, meaning it's orbiting faster.

But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, so it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So if you were to say how much longer is P2 than P1, it's 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. But the options include 0.36 as option A. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the velocity shift differently. Because the shift in wavelength is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect. So the velocity is proportional to the shift. So if planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms and planet #2 has 7, then the velocities are in the same ratio, 5:7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So back to the earlier calculation: K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈0.364.

So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, so the correct option is A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the data provided. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have similar masses to Neptune. The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of the spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The periodic shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the masses of the planets and stars are the same for both systems, the ratio of the velocities \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) depends only on the orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter, not longer, than planet #1's. However, the question specifically asks "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" Based on the calculation, the ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) is approximately 0.36, which matches option A.

Answer: A
