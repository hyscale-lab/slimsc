Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're composed of a quark and an antiquark. But the question is about the mean decay distance. I think I need to figure out how far X, this meson, will travel before it decays.

The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so the answer has to be a length.

Wait, decay distance... I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The formula for the mean lifetime τ is ℏ divided by the width Γ. Oh right, because Γ is the total decay rate, and τ is the inverse of the decay rate.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ here is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving eV·seconds, so I'll need to convert units properly.

Once I have the mean lifetime, I can find how far the particle travels before decaying by multiplying the velocity times the lifetime. Oh, right, the mean decay distance L is c * τ, but wait, maybe I should think about relativistic effects because the particle is produced with high energy. So I should account for the particle's speed, probably using its gamma factor.

Wait, alternatively, I think another approach is to compute the particle's lifetime in its rest frame and then use time dilation to find the lifetime in the lab frame. Then, using velocity, compute the distance. Or perhaps I can compute the particle's lifetime as τ = ħ/(Γ c^2) when using proper units. Hmm, I might be mixing up some formulas.

Wait, let's clarify. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But the units have to work out. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, let's make sure of the units.

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really short, but particles with short lifetimes decay quickly.

But wait, no, I think I might have missed a factor because the formula is actually τ = ħ c / (m Γ) or something like that. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the decay width Γ is given in energy units, and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, that's correct. So with Γ in GeV, ħ in GeV·s, τ will be in seconds.

So calculating τ: τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's a very small time. But how does this relate to the decay distance?

The decay distance L is v * τ. But the particle is moving at some speed. However, when the particle is produced, its energy is given as 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass (1.2 GeV). So this is a relativistic particle. So we need to find its velocity and then multiply by τ to get L.

Wait, but the particle's lifetime in its rest frame is τ_0 = ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ_0, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So L = v * γ τ_0.

Wait, but v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So perhaps L ≈ c * γ τ_0.

Wait, let's structure this properly.

First, calculate τ_0, the proper lifetime: τ_0 = ħ / Γ. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, calculate the Lorentz factor γ for the particle. The energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV.

The relativistic energy is E = γ m c². Solving for γ: γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV (which is GeV/c²?), wait, no, actually, in units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals γ m (in GeV/c²) multiplied by c², so perhaps more accurately, E = γ m c². But when E and m are in the same units (GeV), but m is in GeV/c², so E (GeV) = γ m (GeV/c²) * c², which simplifies to E = γ m. So, γ = E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is 6.6667.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ_0. So τ = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.3712e-23 seconds.

Wait, but then the distance L is the velocity times τ. Assuming v is approximately c, since gamma is about 6.6667, which is high, so v is very close to c. So L ≈ c * τ.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.3712e-23 s ≈ 4.1136e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, maybe my approximations are a bit rough.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the calculation. Let's do it more precisely.

Calculating τ_0:

6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Then γ is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/(3/5) )= 8 *5/3 = 40/3 ≈ 13.3333? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 8/(6/5) )= 8 *5/6 = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667. So yes, about 6.6666667.

Wait, but wait, when I calculate gamma as E/(m c²), but when E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So when E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c², so gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV/c² * c²) )= 8/(1.2) = 6.6666667.

Right, so gamma is 6.6666667.

So τ = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute that.

6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 * 2.056875e-24) + (0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24).

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-24.

Adding them gives 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.37125e-23 + 0.1234125e-23 → no, wait, 1.234125e-23 is 12.34125e-24. Adding 1.37125e-24 gives 13.7125e-24, which is 1.37125e-23 s.

So tau is ~1.37125e-23 s.

Then L = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * 1.37125e-23 s.

3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 3 * 1.37125e-15 = 4.11375e-15 meters.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So my calculation is 4.11375e-15, which is close to option B, but slightly higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should have been more precise with ħ. Let me check the exact value of ħ in GeV·s. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's better to use a more precise value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I was supposed to calculate the decay length using the formula L = c * (tau_0) * (gamma) * (v), but since v is very close to c, maybe it's approximated as L = c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, let me think again. The mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. The distance is v * tau_lab = v * gamma tau_0. But v is approximately c, so L ≈ c gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean path is L = c * (tau_0) * (gamma) * (v/c) )? No, because v is approximately c, so that term is 1. Hmm, maybe I should just proceed with the calculations using precise numbers.

Let me recalculate:

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Tau_0 = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma factor is E/(m c²), but let's compute E and m in terms of GeV and GeV/c².

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) )= 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.6666666667 * 2.056875 = approximately 1.37125.

So 12.34125 +1.37125 = 13.7125 → 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

L = c * tau_lab.

c is 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So L = 2.99792458e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.99792458e8 by 1.37125e-23.

2.99792458e8 × 1.37125e-23 = (2.99792458 × 1.37125) × 1e-15.

Compute 2.99792458 * 1.37125:

Approximately, 2.998 * 1.371 ≈

Let me compute 3 * 1.371 = 4.113.

But since it's 2.998 * 1.37125, perhaps it's approximately 4.11.

So 4.11e-15 meters.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

So my calculation is about 4.11e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) and option C (5.0223e-15 m). But 4.11 is closer to 4.06 than to 5.02.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the mean decay length is more accurately given by

L = (c * tau_0) * (gamma) * (v/c) )

Wait, but v is beta c, so v/c = beta. So L = c * tau_0 * gamma beta.

Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), and beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Hmm, but for gamma=6.6667, beta is sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) → wait, 1/gamma^2 is (3/20)^2? No, wait, 1/gamma is 0.15 (since 6.6667 is 20/3, so 1/gamma is 3/20=0.15).

So 1/gamma^2 is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

So, gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ (6.6667) * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5847.

Wait, but earlier I approximated gamma * beta as gamma, since beta is close to 1. But perhaps the precise calculation would use gamma * beta.

So, then L = c * tau_0 * gamma * beta.

Tau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s * 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 6.6667 * 0.9887 = approximately 6.5847.

Then, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (3 *2.056875) * 1e-16 m = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by 6.5847: 6.170625e-16 m * 6.5847 ≈ 4.0655e-15 m.

Ah, that's exactly option B. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay width is related to the proper mean lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by the formula:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Substituting \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we account for relativistic time dilation. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The lifetime in the lab frame is then:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is the product of the particle's velocity and its lifetime in the lab frame. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its velocity \( v \) is approximately equal to the speed of light \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

To refine the calculation, we consider the exact relativistic relation \( L = c \cdot \tau_0 \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta \), where \( \beta = v/c \). For \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), so:

\[
\gamma \cdot \beta \approx 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 = 6.5847.
\]

Thus:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau_0 \cdot \gamma \cdot \beta = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.5847 = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the closest match is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
