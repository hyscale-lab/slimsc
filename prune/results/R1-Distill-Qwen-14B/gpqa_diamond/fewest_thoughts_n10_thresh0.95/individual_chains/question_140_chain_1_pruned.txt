Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature. 

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, and when calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes, we have to sum them.

Let me think about what X could be. Since it's used in organic chemistry, maybe it's something like a strong base or a metal that reacts with acids. Wait, and it reacts violently with a liquid. Oh, metals reacting with acids produce hydrogen gas. So Y could be an acid, like sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. 

When a metal reacts with an acid, it produces hydrogen gas (W), right? So gas W is H2. But wait, the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. H2 has each hydrogen with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the molecule is H2, which is two atoms. Each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, natural hydrogen is mostly H-1 (protium), which has 0 neutrons. But if X has a heavier isotope, perhaps the acid is reacting with a metal that has an isotope, like maybe deuterium? Hmm, but H2 would have H atoms with 1 proton each, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons if it's H. But the problem says W has same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in total. Let's think: if W is H2, each H has 1 proton. So total protons are 2. Neutrons? Each H is H-1, so 0 neutrons. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if W is something else, like NH3? Wait, no, that's a gas but not produced from metals and acids. Maybe CO2? No, that's produced in different reactions.

Wait another angle: the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think possible diatomic molecules. Let's think about possible gases. H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit. O2: 16 each, so 32 total protons and neutrons. But each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each, so same number. Oh, that fits. So W could be O2? Wait, but when a metal reacts with an acid, what gas is released? Typically, H2 is produced. So that doesn't make sense. Unless the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and acid, which releases CO2. But the product when a carbonate reacts is CO2 and H2O. So gas W would be CO2. But CO2 has 22 protons (12 from C, 16*2 from O) and 22 neutrons? Wait, the molecule's total. Let me calculate: CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Each O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, same number. So W is CO2. But wait, the reaction with Y, which is a liquid. So if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate? Or maybe X is a metal carbonate?

Wait, but the problem says X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, to produce gas W and precipitate G. If X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas and the corresponding salt. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. So G would be CaSO4, but that's soluble in water. Hmm, but precipitate suggests it's insoluble. Maybe Y is a weak acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Or maybe another solid, perhaps ammonium nitrate? Wait, when ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, it absorbs heat. Hmm, no, melting point is different.

Wait, if B is a solid that's formed when G is heated. So when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives calcium oxide and CO2. But CaO's melting point is higher than 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, if when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K, which is 4°C. So B is solid at that temperature. Maybe B is something like water? But that melts at 273 K. Or maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is an oxide.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is way higher. Let me think of another approach. The product of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something. Wait, but when a keto acid reacts with a base, it could form a salt. So maybe X is a base, like NaOH or KOH. Because when a keto acid (like (CH3)2COOH) reacts with a base, it forms a salt. The product would have two oxygen atoms. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a metal like sodium. Let's think about sodium reacting with an acid. For example, sodium (X) reacts with H2O (Y as water?), producing H2 gas (W), and forming NaOH (G as precipitate?), but no, NaOH is soluble. Or perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is sodium metal.

Wait, when sodium reacts with H2SO4, it produces H2 gas, sodium sulfate, and water. Sodium sulfate is soluble, so it wouldn't form a precipitate. So maybe Y is a different acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a chloride solution, but then the product would be a different salt.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate. Suppose X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). If Y is a liquid acid, like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2 gas, and water. The precipitate would be Na2SO4, but that's soluble in water. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's a different carbonate and acid combination.

Wait, perhaps Y is water, and X is a carbonate. Wait, but then heating the carbonate would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. So if G is the metal carbonate, heating it gives B, which is the metal oxide. The melting point of B is around 4°C.

Wait, what metal oxide has a melting point near 4°C? That doesn't make much sense because most metal oxides have higher melting points. Maybe B is not the oxide but something else. Hmm.

Let me think about the product of X and a keto acid having two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. When it reacts with a keto acid, which has a structure like R-CO-OH, the reaction would produce a salt like R-CO-O-Na+ and water. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2COOH, the salt would be (CH3)2COO^- Na^+. That product has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate ion. So that fits.

So X could be NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, used as a reagent in organic chemistry. That makes sense. Now, the reaction of NaOH with a keto acid would form a salt with two oxygen atoms (the carboxylate group). 

Now, going back to the initial reaction: X (NaOH) reacts violently with Y (maybe an acid or another liquid). Oh wait, no, NaOH is a base. Wait, but the question says X reacts with liquid Y. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, but that would produce water and a salt. Alternatively, Y could be something else. Wait, but the initial reaction produces gas W. If X is NaOH, what would it react with to produce a gas? Maybe Y is an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not NaOH but something else. Let me think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, which is a molecule with equal protons and neutrons. So W could be O2, but how? If X is a metal, and Y is water, maybe it's a redox reaction. Wait, metals like sodium reacting with water produce H2 gas. So W would be H2. But then, earlier calculation shows that H2 doesn't have equal protons and neutrons. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons in H2 is 2, total neutrons is 0. So that's not equal. Hmm.

Wait, but if X has a heavier isotope, like deuterium. So maybe the gas is HD? No, that's not a common gas. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else. Let me think again about W. The molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's list possible molecules.

Another possibility is NH3, but that's a triatomic molecule. Wait, but the problem says it's a molecule, so maybe any molecule. Wait, if W is NH3, each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (but actually, natural N has more neutrons). Wait, but the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let's calculate. NH3: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (assuming isotope N-14), H has 1 and 0. So total protons: 7 + 3*1=10. Neutrons: 7 + 3*0=7. Not equal. Hmm.

Another possibility: CO. CO has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and one O (8 each). So protons: 6+8=14. Neutrons: 6+8=14. Oh, that's equal! So W could be CO. But wait, when would CO be released? If X is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CO2, not CO. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is CH4. Protons: 6 (C) + 4*(1 H) =10. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 4*0 =6. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is something else. Let me think of H2O. Protons: 2. Neutrons: 1. No. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is O2. O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8). So total protons and neutrons are 16 each. So that fits. So W is O2. But how is O2 produced? Maybe from the decomposition of a peroxide. But wait, in what reaction would O2 be produced? Maybe an acid reacting with a peroxide, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a strong acid, but producing O2. But that usually requires a strong oxidizing agent, like concentrated H2SO4 with a metal. For example, Cu + concentrated H2SO4 → CuSO4 + SO2 + H2O (but that's SO2, not O2). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed. Then, when G is heated, B is released. And B's melting point is about 277 K, which is 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? No, wait, NH4Cl's melting point is higher. Maybe something like water ice? But water's melting point is 273 K. 277 is a bit higher, so perhaps another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at 4°C but melts around that, like some organic compound.

But perhaps it's simpler. Let's think about the product when a metal carbonate is heated. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. The CaO would be the precipitate. But CaO has a high melting point. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal and Y is water, but that's not likely.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product is a salt, like RCOO-M (where M is the cation from X). So, if the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid, the salt would have the structure (CH3)2COO-M. That salt has two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate group. So X must be a base that provides a cation, like NaOH (providing Na+). So X is NaOH.

So, X is NaOH. Now, let's go back to the initial reaction: NaOH reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing gas W, and forms precipitate G. What reacts with NaOH violently? Maybe an acid like H2SO4, but that would produce water and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a chloride solution, but then the reaction would be NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O. No precipitate.

Wait, maybe Y is a salt solution that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of FeCl3, then NaOH would react to form Fe(OH)3 precipitate. But would that produce a gas? Probably not. Alternatively, Y could be a nitrate solution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. Wait, but then the reaction would produce CO2. So, X is NaOH, Y is a carbonate solution, and the reaction produces CO2 (gas W), and the precipitate would be a sodium salt, but that's soluble. Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, maybe Y is a hydroxide? Or perhaps Y is another base. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, like sodium, and Y is water. Sodium reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. So the reaction would be 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So gas W is H2. But earlier we saw that H2's protons and neutrons don't match, but maybe considering isotopes. If X has a heavier isotope, perhaps the reaction involves deuterium. So if the water (Y) has D instead of H, then the gas would be HD. But HD is not a common gas, and I don't know how that affects the problem.

Wait, but the problem states that W is a gas whose molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. If W is H2, each H is H-1 (1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. That's not equal. So that can't be. So maybe it's not H2.

If X is sodium, and Y is something else, like a carboxylic acid. Sodium reacts with a carboxylic acid to produce the corresponding carboxylate salt and CO2 gas. So, 2 Na + 2 HCOR → 2 NaCOR + CO2↑. No, wait, that would release CO2, which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, as previously calculated. So W is CO2. That fits the condition of the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.

So then, X is sodium metal (Na), Y is a carboxylic acid (like CH3COOH), the reaction produces CO2 (gas W) and the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid (G). But sodium salts of carboxylic acids are generally soluble, so G wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, unless the acid is something else. Maybe Y is a sulfate solution, but then the reaction would form Na2SO4, which is soluble. Not precipitate.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a sulfide, but that would produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 2* (16+0) = 32? No, wait, H2S has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and 1 S (16 p, 16 n). So total p = 18, n =16. Not equal.

Wait, but earlier with CO2, the total p and n are equal. So perhaps W is CO2, and the reaction is between X (a carbonate) and Y (an acid, like H2SO4). So X is CaCO3, Y is H2SO4. Then, reaction: CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. But CaSO4 is only slightly soluble, so it would form a precipitate. Then G is CaSO4, which upon heating would decompose into CaSO4·2H2O or something else. Wait, CaSO4 doesn't decompose upon heating to release B. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal and Y is water, but that produced H2, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So if X is a base like KOH, the product would be the conjugate base of the keto acid, which has a carboxylate group with two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O's.

So, X is KOH. Then, when KOH reacts with a keto acid like acetoacetic acid, it would form the sodium or potassium salt, which has two oxygen atoms in the structure.

Now, back to the initial reaction: KOH reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W and precipitate G. Let's think what Y could be. If Y is a carbonate or another acid, but again, not sure. Wait, if Y is a solution of Al(NO3)3, then KOH would react to form Al(OH)3 precipitate. But what gas would be released? None, probably. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a sulfide. Then, KOH and a sulfide would produce H2S gas. But as before, H2S doesn't meet the condition.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, KOH + Na2CO3 → K2CO3 + NaOH. No, that doesn't produce a precipitate or gas. Alternatively, if Y is H2SO4, then KOH and H2SO4 would produce K2SO4 and water. But K2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between KOH and an acid that produces a gas. For example, if Y is a solution of HCl, but that just produces KCl and water. No gas. Alternatively, if Y is a solution of H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point of about 4°C. So G is something that decomposes upon heating to form B. Let's think about possible compounds. If G is a carbonate, heating would produce CO2 and the oxide. But then B would be the oxide, which has a higher melting point.

Wait, maybe G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The product Na2CO3 is a solid, but its melting point is higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, heating copper hydroxide produces CuO and water. But CuO's melting point is much higher than 277 K.

Wait, another thought: what if G is a carbonate and B is CO2? But CO2 is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like NH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, when a hydrate is heated, it loses water. But that would produce a different solid, not necessarily something with a melting point around 4°C.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above 0°C. So B could be a solid that's close to melting, like a solid that's just below its melting point. Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Wait, no, I'm not sure about its melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point, like a simple inorganic compound. Maybe something like sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is high. Wait, what about something like glucose? No, glucose melts at higher temperatures.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let's try another approach: identifying what X is.

We know X is a substance that reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W (with equal protons and neutrons in its molecule) and a precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Earlier, I thought W might be CO2, which fits the protons and neutrons condition. So perhaps the reaction is between X (a carbonate) and Y (an acid). Then, G would be the corresponding sulfate if Y is H2SO4, for example.

Wait, let's take X as calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Y is H2SO4. The reaction is:

CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

CaSO4 is a precipitate (but it's sparingly soluble, so maybe it precipitates). Then G is CaSO4. Upon heating, CaSO4 doesn't decompose to release a gas. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and Y is H2SO4:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

Na2SO4 is soluble, so G wouldn't precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different acid. Like HCl. Then, X could be a sulfide, but that would release H2S, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a metal. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base like NaOH, then the product would be a carboxylate salt, which has two O in the COO- group. That fits.

So, X is NaOH. Y is a carboxylic acid. Then, the reaction between NaOH and the carboxylic acid would produce the sodium salt and water. But that doesn't produce a precipitate, unless the acid is something else.

Wait, perhaps Y is a sulfide solution. NaOH + H2S → Na2S + H2O. No gas is produced, just a solution. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a metal that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Al(NO3)3, then NaOH would react to form Al(OH)3 precipitate. But what gas is released? None, so that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's
