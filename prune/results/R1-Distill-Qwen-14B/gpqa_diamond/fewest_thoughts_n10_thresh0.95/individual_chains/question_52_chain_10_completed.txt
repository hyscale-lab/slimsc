Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, astronomy isn't my strongest subject, but I'll give it a go.

So the question is about a star's photosphere and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The key here is probably the change in temperature affecting the excitation of these energy levels.

Alright, let's parse the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the presence of spots lower the effective temperature? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall brightness decreases. Hence, the effective temperature goes down.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) goes down when Teff drops. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—comparing when there are no spots (T=6000 K) to when there are (T=5500 K). So the factor is (no spots ratio) divided by (spots ratio). Since the ratio decreases, that factor will be greater than 1.

In LTE (local thermal equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, since we're dealing with two levels, let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present, meaning T decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. Let me think: E_i and E_j are the energies of the two levels. Let's say level 1 is lower than level 2, so E1 < E2. So E_i - E_j is (E1 - E2) = negative. Plugging into the Boltzmann factor: exp( -(E1-E2)/(kT) ) = exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) increases, making the exponential larger. Wait, wait, no. Wait, E2-E1 is positive, and when T is lower, denominator kT is smaller, so the whole fraction (E2-E1)/(kT) is bigger. So exp of a larger positive number is bigger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, wait: if E_i is level 1 and E_j is level 2, and E_i < E_j, then E_i - E_j = negative. So the exponent is (E_i - E_j)/(kT) = negative. So n_i/n_j = (g_i / g_j) * e^[(E_j - E_i)/(kT)].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize. Let's define:

Level 1: energy E1.

Level 2: energy E2 > E1.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} )?

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So, if E_i < E_j, then E_i - E_j is negative. So -(E_i - E_j) is positive. So the exponential is positive. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let me write:

n_i /n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i is higher than E_j, then E_i - E_j is positive, so the exponent is negative, so the ratio is smaller. But if E_i is lower than E_j, then the exponent becomes positive, so the ratio is larger. So higher energy levels have lower populations.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is going down. Which means when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Let me see.

When T is 6000 K (no spots), the ratio is higher. When T drops to 5500 K (spots), the ratio decreases.

So, the ratio R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Wait, no, because E2 is higher than E1.

Wait, let's say we're looking at level 1 and level 2. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So, for the ratio n1/n2,

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which simplifies to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} )

Wait, no. Wait, -(E1 - E2) is E2 -E1. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is the term. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait no, that can't be right because when T is higher, the exponential term would be larger.

Wait, wait: Let me pick numbers to see. Suppose E2 - E1 = delta E, which is positive.

Then, R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * e^{ (delta E) / (k T) }

So, when temperature T increases, the exponent becomes smaller (since T is in denominator), so the exponential term is smaller. So R decreases as T increases.

Wait, but the problem says when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. But according to our calculation, when T decreases, the exponent increases, so R increases. But that's the opposite of what the problem says.

Wait, so maybe I inverted the levels. Perhaps level 1 is higher energy than level 2. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2. So, if the ratio decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when T decreases), that suggests that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.

So, according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * e^{ -(E1 - E2)/(k T) }

Suppose E1 > E2. Then E1 - E2 is positive. So -(E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative. So R would be (g1/g2) * e^{-x}, where x is positive.

So as T increases, the denominator (k T) increases, so x = (E1 - E2)/(k T) decreases. So e^{-x} increases. So R increases as T increases. Which matches the problem statement: when T is higher (no spots), R is higher. When T drops (spots), R drops. So that makes sense.

So the energy level of level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

So the ratio is R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

We can write delta E = E1 - E2 = positive.

So R = (g1/g2) * e^{ - delta E/(k T) }

We're looking for R when T is 6000 K versus when T is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes from 6000 to 5500, R decreases. Because 5500 is lower, so R goes down.

So, the question is, what's the factor by which R changes when T is 6000 K compared to when it's 5500 K.

So, the factor is R_high / R_low = [ (g1/g2) e^{- delta E/(k T_high) } ] / [ (g1/g2) e^{- delta E/(k T_low) } ] = e^{ [ - delta E/(k T_high ) + delta E/(k T_low ) ] } 

Simplify the exponent: delta E/(k) [ 1/(T_low) - 1/(T_high) ]

So, the factor is exp [ (delta E / k) (1/(T_low) - 1/(T_high)) ]

But we don't know delta E. However, we do have the wavelength of the transition between these two levels, which is approximately 1448 Angstroms. So this wavelength corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels.

We can calculate delta E using the relation E = hc / lambda.

Yes, because the energy of a photon is given by E = hc / lambda. So delta E = hc / lambda.

So, let's compute delta E.

Constants:
h = Planck's constant = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s
lambda = 1448 Angstroms = 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

So delta E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So delta E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, since E = hc/lambda, so 1448 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet range. Hmm, but wait, 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm, which is UV.

But regardless, let's compute delta E in Joules.

Wait, but wait. Another approach is to compute delta E in terms of k*T, since we're dealing with exponents involving k*T.

Because the exponent is (delta E)/(k T), so perhaps it's easier to compute that ratio.

Let me compute (delta E) / (k T) for both temperatures.

K is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, delta E / (k T) = [ (hc)/(lambda k) ) ] / T = (h c)/(lambda k T )

So, let's compute that for T_high = 6000 K and T_low = 5500 K.

Compute (h c) / (lambda k) first.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So (h c) / (lambda k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1448 * 1.38e-33 = approx 1448 * 1.38 = let's compute that.

1448 * 1 is 1448.

1448 * 0.38 = approx 1448 * 0.4 = 579.2, but less a bit. Let's compute 1448 * 0.38 = 1448 * (38/100) = (1448 * 38)/100.

1448 * 38: 1448 * 30 = 43440, 1448 *8=11584. Total 43440 +11584=55024. So 55024/100=550.24.

So 1448 * 1.38 ≈ 1448 + 550.24 = 1998.24.

Wait, actually, the denominator is 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = (1448 * 1.38) * 1e-33 = 1998.24e-33 = 1.99824e-30 J·m.

So, numerator is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Denominator is 1.99824e-30 J·m.

So (h c)/(lambda k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) = approx 1e5 (1e5 is 100,000).

So approximately 1e5.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 1.99824e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.99824) * 1e5.

1.9878 / 1.99824 ≈ 0.995.

So 0.995e5 = 99500.

So approximately 1e5.

So (h c)/(lambda k) ≈ 1e5.

So (h c)/(lambda k T) = (1e5) / T.

So for T_high = 6000 K, this is 1e5 / 6000 ≈ 16.6667.

For T_low =5500 K, 1e5 /5500 ≈ 18.1818.

So, delta E/(k T) = 1e5 / T.

So, the exponent in the ratio factor is:

(delta E/k) (1/(T_low) - 1/(T_high)) ) = (1e5) ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

Multiply by 1e5: 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

So, exponent is about 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151.

Compute e^1.5151: since e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.4 is about 4.055.

Wait, let me think. Let's compute e^1.5151.

We can approximate: e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

1.5151 is 1.5 + 0.0151. So e^0.0151 ≈ 1 + 0.0151 + (0.0151^2)/2 ≈ 1.0151 + (0.000228) ≈ 1.015328.

So e^1.5151 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.0151 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.015328 ≈ 4.55.

Wait, but wait, 1.5151 is approximately 1.515. Let me compute e^1.515.

Another approach: using a calculator-like approach.

We know that:

ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504077.

ln(4.6)≈1.526064.

So 1.515 is between 1.504 and 1.526.

Compute:

1.515 is 0.011 above 1.504.

The difference between ln(4.6) and ln(4.5) is ~0.022 over an increase of 0.0932 (from 4.5 to 4.6).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to interpolate.

The value 1.515 is between ln(4.5)=1.504 and ln(4.6)=1.526.

The distance between 1.504 and 1.526 is 0.022.

1.515 is 0.011 above 1.504. So 0.011/0.022 = 0.5. So halfway between 4.5 and 4.6.

So e^1.515 ≈ ~4.55, which is (4.5 +4.6)/2 = 4.55.

Wait, but that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, using a calculator:

e^1.5151 ≈ e^(1.5 + 0.0151) = e^1.5 * e^0.0151.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.0151: using the Taylor series, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2.

x=0.0151.

x²= (0.0151)^2 = approx 0.000228.

So e^0.0151 ≈ 1 + 0.0151 + 0.000228/2 ≈ 1.0151 + 0.000114 ≈ 1.015214.

So e^1.5151 ≈4.4817 * 1.015214 ≈4.4817 * 1.015.

Compute 4.4817 * 1.015:

4.4817 * 1 =4.4817.

4.4817 * 0.015=0.0672255.

Total: 4.4817 + 0.0672255 ≈4.5489.

So approximately 4.55.

So the factor is about 4.55. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the factor is R_high / R_low = e^1.515 ≈4.55.

So when the star has no spots, the ratio is 4.55 times higher than when it has spots.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5, so the answer is C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation in the context of local thermal equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the energies of the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the energy level of the numerator (\(E_1\)) is higher than the denominator (\(E_2\)).

The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light, the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Substituting the constants:
- \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\),

we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio of populations depends on the temperature through the term \(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{T=6000 K}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{T=5500 K}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{low}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{high}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(T_{\text{high}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_{\text{low}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k}\), we compute:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{(1448 \times 10^{-10})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \approx 1.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{low}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{high}}}\right) = (1.0 \times 10^5) \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right).
\]

Calculating the difference in reciprocals:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \text{so } \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent is:

\[
(1.0 \times 10^5)(0.00001515) \approx 1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is **4.5**, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
