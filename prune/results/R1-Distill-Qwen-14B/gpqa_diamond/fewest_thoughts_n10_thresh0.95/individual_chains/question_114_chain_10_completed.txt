Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to give a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, so I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, there's a specific reaction involved. Oh wait, the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid helps to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic so the nitrile can attack.

So for the first reaction, NaCN is the nitrile source. The reagent A must be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, option A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option C uses NaHSO3 as A. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, like from H2SO4 or HCl. But NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. Hmm, but I think for the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is typically a proton source. So maybe H3O+ is the right catalyst here.

Then the second reaction. The product is a carboxylic acid. The starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, wait. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, but with some substituents. Oh, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when it reacts with water (B is H2O, according to the question), under what conditions would a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. 

For nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, I think using H2O with an acid catalyst is needed. Like HCl or H2SO4. But wait, there's also another possibility: if you have a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent, maybe it's undergoing some kind of oxidation or further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is part of the structure that's involved in the hydrolysis.

Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) at the end becomes a COOH group. So it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But the starting nitrile has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the CN? Wait, but that might complicate things because the structure 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would have OH and CN on the same carbon. Wait, that's possible, but I'm not sure how that affects the hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the starting material, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. When that undergoes hydrolysis, perhaps under acidic or basic conditions, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So for the second step, the reagent B is H2O, but what else is needed?

Wait, no, the second reaction's reagent B is H2O but what's the other component? I think the options suggest that B is either HCl or something else. Wait, looking at the options, choice A says B is HCl. Option B says B is CH3COOH. Oh wait, no, the question says the second reaction uses B (H2O) as a reagent. Wait, perhaps I misread that. Let me check the question again.

Ah, no, the second reaction is the product of the first reaction with B. So the second reaction's reagents are the hydroxynitrile and B. Wait, wait, the question says that the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) â†’ 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So B is H2O but under what conditions?

Wait, perhaps the reagent is an acid. Because hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires either acid or base. If it's in acidic conditions, then H2O with HCl or another acid would be used. Alternatively, maybe it's a base, but I think for the formation of a carboxylic acid from nitrile, acidic conditions are better. So the second step uses H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl.

So looking at the options, in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like from H2SO4, which is a typical catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Wait, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option B is A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

For the second reaction, B (the reagent) is H2O plus something. So for the nitrile to carboxylic acid, the reagent would be H2O with an acid. So if the second reaction's reagent B is HCl, that fits. So looking at option A, B is HCl.

Alternatively, option B says B is CH3COOH. But I think for hydrolysis to the acid, you need a strong acid, so HCl would be better.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and for the second, B is HCl (option A).

So the correct option would be option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again. If A is NaHSO3, that's a source of H+ and sulfite. Does that work as a catalyst for cyanohydrin formation? I think the usual catalyst is a strong acid like H2SO4, which would give H3O+ as the proton source. So perhaps NaHSO3 is a milder acid, but I'm not sure if that's sufficient. I think H3O+ is more likely.

So the correct answer should be option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the nitrile to attack. Among the options, H3O+ is a strong acid and a typical catalyst for this reaction, making it the suitable choice for reagent A.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, acidic conditions are preferred. HCl is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for this hydrolysis, making it the suitable choice for reagent B.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. While H3O+ is correct for the first reaction, CH3COOH is a weaker acid and less effective for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid and less suitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH. Both reagents are less suitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
