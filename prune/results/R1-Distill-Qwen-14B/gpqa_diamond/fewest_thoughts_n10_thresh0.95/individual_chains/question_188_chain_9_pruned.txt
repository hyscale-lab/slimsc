Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, and all angles are 30 degrees. Oh wait, but the interatomic distance might be the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a simple cubic structure. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral structure, it's a bit more complicated. Wait, actually, in a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in other structures, like face-centered or body-centered, it's different. But since the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstrom, I think that must be the lattice parameter 'a' here. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is just the edge length, but in more complex structures, maybe it's not. Wait, but maybe for a rhombohedral, each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron, so the distance between nearest neighbors is 'a' times something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in the rhombohedral case. Because in a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral, if it's a primitive cell (only atoms at corners), then the nearest neighbor would still be along the edge, so a is the distance. So I think a is 10 Angstrom here.

The formula for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos β + kl cos γ + lh cos α) )). Wait, or is it another formula? I'm trying to recall. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma + lh \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, but wait, the angles in a rhombohedral are all equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here. So substituting, the denominator becomes sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos(30) - 2kl cos(30) - 2lh cos(30) ).

So the question is about the (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting h, k, l as 1,1,1, let's compute the denominator:

Denominator = sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2[ (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ] )

Compute that:

Inside the sqrt, 3 - 2[ cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ].

Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 - 2 * 3 * (sqrt(3)/2) → 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator is sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that:

3 - 3*sqrt(3) = 3 (1 - sqrt(3)).

Wait, no, 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196. Oh wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real, which doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + kl \cos\alpha + lh \cos\beta) } }

Wait, maybe I mixed up the angles. Because in the general case, the angles correspond to the angles between axes, but I think the formula uses the angle between a and b as γ, and between a and c as β, etc. Maybe I should clarify. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps for rhombohedral, since all angles
