Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, unlike a pure state, which is a single ket vector, a density matrix is a statistical mixture of states.

Wait, what's the difference between a pure state and a mixed state again? Oh right, a pure state has a density matrix with trace squared equal to 1, while a mixed state has a trace squared less than 1. Because for a pure state |psi><psi|, the trace is 1, and the square is also 1. But for a mixed state, the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors, so the square of the trace (which is the same as the trace of the square) would be less than 1.

So looking at the given rho: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Each of these is a projector, and the coefficients are 1/2 each. That makes sense for a mixed state because 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, so it's a valid density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh, wait, I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, for a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, the density matrix is |psi><psi|, and the Bloch vector is expressed as (x, y, z), where z is the expectation value of the Pauli Z operator, and x, y are related to the other Pauli matrices.

But wait, what about mixed states? How are they represented on the Bloch sphere? I think for mixed states, the density matrix can be written as a convex combination of projectors, and their Bloch vectors would also contribute accordingly. Alternatively, maybe the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components.

Let me recall the general form of a single-qubit density matrix. A general density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. This applies when the state is a pure state on the Bloch sphere, but wait, no—wait, that form is for a pure state. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, actually, for a general qubit state, whether pure or mixed, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector whose magnitude is ≤ 1 (for mixed states, it's less than 1, for pure it's exactly 1).

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The pure state |psi> can be written as a vector on the Bloch sphere. Then, the density matrix for a pure state is |psi><psi|, which can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. For mixed states, rho is a statistical mixture, so perhaps it's a combination of such terms.

Alternatively, maybe any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. So let's expand rho to see.

The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that.

First, |0> is [1; 0], |1> is [0; 1]. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then rho is (1/2) I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, wait, I think I've made a mistake here. Because if I add |0><0| and |1><1|, that's the identity matrix. So rho = (I)/2. So rho is (1/2) * I.

But wait, what does that mean? That would imply that the density matrix is a completely mixed state. Because for a pure state, rho squared equals rho. Let me check: rho squared is (I/2)^2 = I^2/4 = I/4. But rho is I/2, so rho squared is (I/2)^2 = I/4, which is not equal to rho. So yes, rho is a mixed state.

Now, the Bloch vector representation: in general, any single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2. So:

rho = (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2

But in our case, rho is (I)/2. So plugging that in:

I/2 = (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z

Hmm, that implies that each component r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero because sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are the Pauli matrices, which are linearly independent. So the only solution is r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

Wait, but that would mean the Bloch vector is at the origin. Which makes sense, because a completely mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere. Because for a pure state, the Bloch vector has length 1, and the further you get from the origin (but still within the sphere), the more mixed the state is? Or wait, no, the mixed state is represented with the vector inside the sphere, and the pure states lie on the surface. So a completely mixed state would be at the center, the origin.

So the point r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix is (I)/2. When written in terms of the Pauli matrices, all the coefficients (r_x, r_y, r_z) must be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). So the geometric position is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state, as the density matrix is a statistical mixture of the computational basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability.

For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (\(r_x, r_y, r_z\)) must all be zero. This implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

A completely mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by the origin. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix \(\rho\) in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
