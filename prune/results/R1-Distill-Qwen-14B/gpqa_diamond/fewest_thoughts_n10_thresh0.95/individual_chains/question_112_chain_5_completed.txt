Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha>. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin states can be represented as vectors, and the z-component usually has eigenvalues of ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for spin-up and spin-down, respectively.

The first part of the problem asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that matrix must be 2x2 because we have two eigenstates (up and down). So the matrix would look like this:

[0   ħ/2]
[ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, that's a matrix where all diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. But wait, matrices are usually represented with elements A_ij where i is the row and j the column. So for a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the matrix is:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait a second, is the operator Hermitian? Because quantum mechanical observables must be Hermitian. Let me check. The given matrix elements: for i=1, j=2, A_12=ħ/2, and A_21=ħ/2. So the matrix is symmetric, meaning it's Hermitian if the elements are real. Since ħ is real, the matrix is Hermitian. So this operator is a valid observable.

Now, I recall that the eigenvalues of such a matrix for a 2x2 case can be found using the characteristic equation. The trace is zero (since diagonal elements are 0), and the determinant is (0)(0) - (ħ/2)^2 = -(ħ^2)/4. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4, so λ = ± ħ/2. Wait, that's interesting because the eigenvalues are the same as the spin-z eigenvalues. Hmm, but the matrix is different, so it's a different operator, perhaps related to spin-x or something else.

Wait, the Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which multiplied by ħ/2 would give a matrix similar to A. Because our A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenvalues are ±1 for Pauli X, so scaled by ħ/2, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, same as spin-z.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), perhaps? Or wait, I might have to double-check the exact expressions.

Wait, no. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2). Wait, for spin-1/2 systems, |up> might be |0> and |down> |1>, but I think it's more accurate that the eigenstates of X are the superpositions of |up> and |down> such that X|+x> = |+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

So, in any case, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, and the question is asking for the probability of measuring the electron in each of these states when the state is |alpha>.

Wait, but |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But wait, the normalization factor is missing. So first, I need to normalize |alpha> to find the actual state vector.

So first step: find the normalization constant to make |alpha> a unit vector.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> to find the normalization factor.

The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the state is a column vector. Let me represent |up> as [1; 0] and |down> as [0; 1].

So the vector |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T. Then <alpha|alpha> = (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Let's compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 + i) = (1)(2) + (1)(i) - i(2) -i(i) = 2 + i - 2i - (i²). Since i² = -1, so this becomes 2 -i +1 = 3 -i? Wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

Wait, (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. So (1-i)(2+i) = (1)(2) + (1)(i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(i) = 2 +i -2i -i². i² is -1, so minus (-1) becomes +1. So 2 + (i-2i) +1 → 2 -i +1 = 3 - i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 -i) = (2)(1) + (2)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 2 -2i + i -i². Again, i² is -1, so -i² is +1. So 2 -i +1 = 3 - i.

So <alpha|alpha> = (3 -i) + (3 -i) = 6 - 2i. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no, because |alpha> is proportional to the given vector. So the inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Wait, no, that's the same as (1-i)(2+i) multiplied by 1, plus (2+i)(1-i) multiplied by 1. Wait, but actually, the inner product is the conjugate transpose times the vector. So for |alpha> being [a; b], <alpha|alpha> = a* a + b* b. So a =1+i, b=2-i.

So a* is (1 -i), b* is (2 +i).

So <alpha|alpha> = (1 -i)(1 + i) + (2 +i)(2 -i).

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(1 +i) = 1*(1) +1*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i) = 1 +i -i -i². i² =-1, so 1 +0i +1 = 2.

(2+i)(2−i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So <alpha|alpha> = 2 +5 =7.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>. We need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with a 2x2 system, it's easier to find the expansion coefficients.

Let me recall that the eigenstates of the operator A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, I think that's correct. Because X acting on |+x> gives |+x> multiplied by 1 (in terms of the Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but our operator A is (ħ/2) X, so the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) and -(ħ/2).

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

The coefficients c_+ and c_- are the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, respectively.

So let's compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) → the bra is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] |alpha> → (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ].

But |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> / sqrt(7).

So <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So c_+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2).

Combine numerator terms: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So c_+ = (3/sqrt(7)) / sqrt(2) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So c_- = [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ] / sqrt(2) → [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2).

Compute numerator: (1+i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

So the coefficients are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. The probabilities are the square of the magnitudes of these coefficients. Let's compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

|c_+|^2 = (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

|c_-|^2 = [ (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14) ] * [ (-1 -2i)/sqrt(14) ) ] → [ ( (-1)(-1) ) + ( (-1)(-2i) ) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i) ) ] all divided by 14.

Wait, actually, to compute |c_-|^2, it's ( (-1 + 2i) ) ( (-1 - 2i) ) divided by 14.

The product is (-1)^2 + (2i)^2 + cross terms. Wait, but more accurately:

(-1 + 2i)(-1 -2i) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i)
= 1 + 2i - 2i -4i²
i² = -1, so -4i² = 4.
So 1 + 0i +4 =5.

So |c_-|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. But 0.6429 + 0.3571 = 1, which makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, the probabilities are in the first two parts of each option. Let me see the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → 0.64+0.36=1. So that's about 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571. But option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close but not exact.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

c_+ is [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7*2) → [3] / sqrt(14), so |c_+|^2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

c_- is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → [ (1+i -2 +i) ]= (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14). So the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4 =5 → 5/14 ≈0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 64.29% and 35.71%.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities, which is about 64% and 36%. Close, but not exact. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which is off. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which seems opposite. Option B has 0.54 and 0.46.

Wait, I'm getting 9/14 and 5/14, which is about 0.6429 and 0.3571. So perhaps the exact values are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's the closest match.

But wait, let's make sure because perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the operator A is being confused with the spin-x operator, and the eigenstates are different. But I think the approach was correct.

Now, the second part of the question asks for the average value of operator A.

The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, let's compute this.

Alternatively, since we have the state |alpha> in the basis of |up> and |down>, and the operator A in matrix form, we can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, the expectation value of A would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of X.

The expectation value of X in state |alpha> can be found using the formula <X> = <alpha| X |alpha>.

Alternatively, since X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and the expectation value is the sum of probabilities times their eigenvalues.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So, the average value would be (probability of + eigenstate * ħ/2) + (probability of - eigenstate * (-ħ/2)).

From the earlier calculation, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) /14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = (2 ħ)/(14) ) → ħ/7.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that again.

(9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 → (4 * ħ/2 ) /14 → (2 ħ) /14 → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average value ħ/7. So if the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7, that would match option A.

But wait, let me recompute the average value using the matrix approach to confirm.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute A |alpha> first:

A |alpha> = [ ( (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (ħ/2) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of |alpha> dotted with this vector.

So <alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Dot product:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2 (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2 (1 +i)/sqrt(7) )

Factor out ħ/(2 *7):

= [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] * ħ/(2*7)

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2(i) +i(1) +i(i) → 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding them together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is (2) * ħ/(14) )= ħ/7.

So that's correct.

Now, the probabilities were approximately 0.643 (9/14) and 0.357 (5/14), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's a match.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The state is not normalized, so we compute the normalization factor by calculating \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \). 

The inner product is:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix is Hermitian, and its eigenstates are \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \) matrix, given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap coefficients \( c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing the results with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \) (rounded from \( 0.643 \) and \( 0.357 \)) and the average value \( \hbar/7 \) match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
