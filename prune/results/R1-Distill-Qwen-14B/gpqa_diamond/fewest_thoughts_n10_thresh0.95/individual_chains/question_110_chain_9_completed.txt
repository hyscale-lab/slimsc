--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, wait. Let me read that again. It says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, wait, brighter than 17? Or is it fainter? Because higher magnitude numbers mean fainter. Oh wait, no, no. Apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, that means its magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17. So, the ESPRESSO can observe stars with V_apparent <17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V_apparent <16 mag. Because it says brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must have V apparent magnitude less than 16 for HIRES, and less than 17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17, meaning apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. So, if something is more bright (lower magnitude), it's acceptable. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars where V_apparent <17. HIRES can observe stars where V_apparent <16.

So, any star that is detected by both would need to have V_apparent less than 16 (since that's the stricter condition for both). Because if a star is brighter than 16 (V_apparent <16), then it's detectable by both because HIRES requires less than 16, and ESPRESSO allows up to 17.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait. No, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the question says which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both instruments. So, the star must satisfy both conditions: it must be brighter than the limit of each.

Wait, no. The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than what each instrument can observe. So, for both instruments, the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than their maximum. So, for each instrument, the star must meet their respective limits. So, for HIRES, the star's apparent V must be less than 16. For ESPRESSO, less than 17.

Therefore, to be detected by both, the star must have V_apparent <16, because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, no. Wait. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then it's within the limit of HIRES (which can go up to 16). But for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, it's also within the limit. So, a star with V_apparent <16 will be detectable by both. If a star is between 16 and 17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So, the star needs to be brighter than 16 (V <16) to be detected by both.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So, the star must be detectable by both. So, the star must have V_apparent <16 (since HIRES can only go up to 16, and ESPRESSO up to 17). So, only stars with V_apparent <16 will be detected by both.

Now, let's look at the stars.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, located at 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is M. So apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: m = 15.5 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

So V_apparent is 15.5 <16, so it's detectable by both. Because 15.5 is less than 16.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. So that's 16.5, which is higher than 16. So, it's not detectable by HIRES (which can only go up to 16). So Star2 can be observed by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 <17) but not by HIRES.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, there's more. Star3 has E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. The note says that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So, extinction (A_v) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed V magnitude is the intrinsic (apparent?) plus extinction? Wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. So the star's light is dimmed; so the observed apparent magnitude m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. The star's intrinsic (or absolute) magnitude is M. The apparent magnitude without extinction is m0. Then, with extinction, m_observed = m0 + A_v.

So, in the case of Star3, what is the apparent V magnitude?

Wait, the star's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude? Wait, no. The information says: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So, wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (corrected) magnitude, or the intrinsic. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the observed (i.e., after extinction) magnitude. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and extinction adds to it. Hmm, this needs to be clarified.

Wait, let me think again. The way the question is phrased: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 mag is the observed (i.e., after extinction) magnitude. So, the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v. So, m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, that would make the star brighter. Or perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the observed is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the extinction-corrected value, so the observed magnitude would be higher.

Wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong. Let me think more carefully.

In reality, when a star's light passes through interstellar dust, it gets absorbed and scattered, making the star appear fainter and redder. The apparent magnitude increases (becomes larger) due to extinction. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m0, then the observed apparent magnitude m = m0 + A_v.

So, if the question gives the star's apparent V mag as 15.5, that's after extinction. So then m_observed = 15.5. But wait, the question gives the star's apparent V magnitude without considering extinction, or with? Hmm, the way it's written, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (m), and the intrinsic (before extinction) is m_intrinsic = m - A_v.

Wait, but the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, and the star's actual brightness is m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and the observed is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me make this clear. Let me think about what the question is giving. Star3's data: apparent V magnitude is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5. But the actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude without extinction is lower (since extinction makes it appear fainter). So, m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

So m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, but that's not the way the question is phrased. The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." Hmm, maybe the apparent magnitude given is the actual m, including extinction. So, the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both? Wait, but wait. Because if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16, then it's within both instruments' capabilities. But wait, wait. But wait, if the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, that's acceptable for both. So, then Star3 would be detectable by both.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the given 15.5 mag includes extinction or not. Because the E(B-V) is given, so the extinction A_v is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So, if the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, then the observed magnitude would be 15.5 +1.86 =17.36. That's above 17, so ESPRESSO could observe it (since it's up to 17), but HIRES can't.

Alternatively, if the given 15.5 is the observed magnitude (after extinction), then the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. So the star is even brighter than 15.5, which is definitely <16, so detectable by both.

Hmm. So this depends on whether Star3's apparent magnitude is given as observed or intrinsic. The way the question is written, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". Hmm. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the observed (i.e., m_observed) magnitude, including extinction. So then, the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be lower, but that's not necessary for our calculation, because what matters is the observed magnitude. Because when considering whether the instrument can detect the star, you use the observed magnitude.

Wait, but wait. If the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, then it's less than 16. So detectable by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction). Then the observed (m) would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit (brighter than 17? No, because 17.36 is greater than 17, so it's fainter. So ESPRESSO can't observe it. So Star3 would not be detectable by either.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The key is, for each star, what is their apparent V magnitude as observed (i.e., after extinction). Because the instrument's limit is based on the observed apparent magnitude.

So, for each star, I need to compute their actual observed V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then see if it is below 16 (for HIRES) and below 17 (for ESPRESSO).

Let me process each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag M =15.5, distance d=10 pc.

Apparent magnitude m = M +5 log10(d/10) → 15.5 +5*log10(1) =15.5 → m=15.5.

No mention of extinction, so E(B-V)=0, A_v=0. So observed m=15.5.

Thus, since 15.5 <16, detectable by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag =16.5. No info on extinction, so E(B-V)=0. So m=16.5.

So 16.5>16, so detectable by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 <17) but not by HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_v=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So observed m = m_intrinsic + A_v? Wait, no. Wait, m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (m_intrinsic) =15.5, then m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36. That's above 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. But if the given 15.5 is the observed (after extinction), then m_observed=15.5, and m_intrinsic=15.5-1.86=13.64. But in either case, the observed m is 15.5 or 17.36.

Wait, but the question specifies the apparent V magnitude as 15.5. So perhaps the observed m is 15.5. Because the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5". So extinction would have already been accounted for. Or wait, no. Because if the star is behind dust, the apparent magnitude would be dimmer (higher number) than the intrinsic.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", does that include the extinction (dust) or not? In astronomy, when the term "apparent magnitude" is used without mention of extinction, it usually refers to the observed magnitude, which already includes extinction. But sometimes, it's considered the intrinsic magnitude. So this is a point of confusion here.

But looking at Star3's description: it's located at 15 pc, so the distance is given, and the apparent magnitude is given. Also, E(B-V) is given, which suggests that extinction is a factor. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (i.e., without extinction), and the observed would be higher.

So, for Star3: m_intrinsic =15.5. Then, the observed m =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but that can't be. Because that would make the observed m=17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So Star3 would not be detected by either.

But that doesn't make sense because Star3 is located at 15 pc, which is closer than Star1's 10 pc. Wait, no, 15 pc is farther than 10 pc. So perhaps it's brighter in absolute terms but dimmer in apparent.

Alternatively, perhaps I've got the wrong approach. Let's re-approach each star.

For each star, compute their observed apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then see if it is below 16 (for HIRES) and below 17 (for ESPRESSO). Only stars that meet both will be detectable by both.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 + 0 =15.5.

Assuming no extinction (since E(B-V) not given), so observed m=15.5. So m <16: detectable by both. So Star1 is possible.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=0 (since not given). So observed m=16.5. 16.5>16, so detectable by ESPRESSO (16.5<17), but not by HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15pc. So first compute m_intrinsic. Wait, no. Let's compute the observed m: m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, but I think in this case, the given m is the observed (apparent) magnitude. So we have to correct for extinction. So, the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_v.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the star is reddened, the observed m is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, but without knowing whether the given m is intrinsic or observed, this is a problem. The question gives m=15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the given m is the observed (without extinction), so the intrinsic would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and the observed is m_obs = m + A_v.

Hmm. Let me think of an example. Suppose a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude of 15.5, and A_v=1.86. Then the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is above 17, so only detectable by HIRES if it's below 16. 17.36>17, so not detectable by ESPRESSO either.

Alternatively, if the given m is the observed (15.5), then the intrinsic m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But then, since the observed m is 15.5, which is less than 16, detectable by both. So Star3 would be detectable by both.

But wait, how can that be? Because the star is at 15 pc, which is farther than Star1's 10 pc. So if the observed m is 15.5, that's dimmer than Star1's observed m of 15.5 as well. Hmm, but Star3 has more extinction.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Another approach: for each star, compute their observed m (apparent V mag) after extinction, and see if it's <16 for both.

Let me do that.

Star1: No extinction, so m=15.5. So <16: detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5, no extinction. So 16.5>16: detectable by ESPRESSO (16.5<17), but not by HIRES.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, the given m is 15.5. So, either the observed m is 15.5, and the extinction is 1.86, so the intrinsic m is 13.64. Or the given m is the intrinsic, and the observed is 15.5+1.86=17.36.

But the question says that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So that's the observed m. So, the observed m is 15.5, which is <16. So detectable by both. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but extinction would make the apparent magnitude larger (fainter), not smaller. So if the observed m is 15.5, which is lower than the intrinsic (without extinction), that can't be right. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed m is higher than the intrinsic. So if the observed m is 15.5, the intrinsic must be less than 15.5. So the given m must be the observed. So, in that case, Star3 has an observed m of 15.5, which is under both instruments' limits. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, no. Wait, if the star's light is absorbed, then the observed m is higher. So if the observed m is 15.5, then without extinction, it would have been lower (brighter). So in this case, the extinction doesn't affect the detectability. Because the observed m is what matters for the instrument's detection limits.

So, for Star3, if the observed m is 15.5, which is <16, then it's detectable by both. So Star3 is a candidate.

Star4: Absolute V mag M=15.5, distance d=10 pc. E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute the apparent magnitude:

m = M +5 log10(d/10) →15.5 + 0 =15.5.

Now, compute the extinction A_v =3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So, the observed m = m + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, no: if the apparent magnitude without extinction is m_intrinsic=15.5, then the observed m is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

But wait, that would be the case if the given M is the intrinsic magnitude. Because M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without extinction. So, the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude at 10 pc is M=15.5. So, with extinction, the observed apparent magnitude at 10 pc would be M_obs = M + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

But wait, the star is located at 10 pc, so the actual apparent magnitude would be m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_v. Because the distance modulus gives the apparent magnitude without extinction, then adding the extinction gives the observed.

So m_observed =15.5 + (5 log10(10/10)=0) ) +1.24 =16.74.

So 16.74>16, so detectable by ESPRESSO (since 16.74<17), but not by HIRES. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute V mag M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5) →16.5 +5*(-0.3010)≈16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

No extinction given, so A_v=0. So observed m=15.0.

15.0 is less than 16, so detectable by both. So Star5 is a candidate.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, no. Wait, let's recap:

Star1: m_observed=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star3: m_observed=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star5: m_observed≈15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, but what about Star5's apparent m? Let me recalculate.

M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) →16.5 +5 log10(0.5) →16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So yes, m=15.0, which is <16.

So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, so which options have these stars?

Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is 16.74>16. So only Star5 is okay. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both have m <16. So that's possible.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 has m=16.5 (can't be detected by HIRES). So C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is okay, but Star4's m=16.74>16. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both have m<16.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So option B would have both Star3 and Star5 detectable by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is <16, so detectable by both. Star5's m_observed is 15.0, which is also <16.

So option B would be correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star3's extinction.

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_v=1.86.

So, the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36? Or is it 15.5 as observed, with A_v=1.86, which would mean the intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, this is the confusion again.

If the given apparent magnitude of Star3 is the observed (after extinction), then m_obs=15.5, which is <16. So detectable by both. But if the given m is the intrinsic, then the observed m=15.5+1.86=17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's limit.

But the question states that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So the given m is the observed, so the extinction is already accounted for. So m_obs=15.5 <16 → detectable by both.

Similarly, Star5 has no extinction, so m=15.0 <16.

So, the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where all three are correct. The options are:

A) 4 and5

B) 3 and5

C)2 and3

D)1 and4

So, the correct option is B) Star3 and Star5.

But wait, what about Star1?

Star1's m_obs=15.5, which is <16 → detectable by both. So why isn't it included in the options? Because the options don't have an option that includes Star1 and Star5.

Wait, the options are looking for which pair can be detected with both instruments. So Star1 is detectable by both, but in the options, D is Star1 and Star4. Star4's m_obs=16.74, which is not detectable by HIRES. So D is incorrect.

So, the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't have an option with all three.

Wait, but the question is which pair can be detected with both instruments. So perhaps the only pair is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but why isn't Star1 included in any option? Let me look again.

The options are:

A) 4 and5 → no, 4 can't.

B)3 and5 → both can.

C)2 and3 → 2 can't.

D)1 and4 →4 can't.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
  \]  
- No extinction mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5$.  
- Since $15.5 < 16$, this star is detectable by both instruments.

#### **Star2**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$  
- No extinction mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 16.5$.  
- Since $16.5 > 16$, this star is detectable by ESPRESSO (as $16.5 < 17$) but not by HIRES.  
- Therefore, this star is **not** detectable by both instruments.

#### **Star3**  
- Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$  
- Total absorption in the V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]  
- The question specifies the apparent V magnitude as $15.5$, which is the observed magnitude (already accounting for extinction).  
- Since $15.5 < 16$, this star is detectable by both instruments.

#### **Star4**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
- Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
  \]  
- Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$  
- Total absorption in the V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
- Observed magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- Since $16.74 > 16$, this star is detectable by ESPRESSO (as $16.74 < 17$) but not by HIRES.  
- Therefore, this star is **not** detectable by both instruments.

#### **Star5**  
- Absolute V magnitude: $M = 16.5$  
- Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
- Apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
  \]  
- No extinction mentioned, so $m_{\text{observed}} = 15.0$.  
- Since $15.0 < 16$, this star is detectable by both instruments.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected with both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
