Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I need to find the energy when the speed is 0.96c. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So natural lithium has different isotopes, but if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 neutrons would be Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. Got it.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. To find the energy, I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), relativistic effects are definitely important here.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². Where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

First, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Hmm, the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its components. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and the neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². But wait, when you combine them into a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy, so the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but for heavy ions like this, the mass can be calculated using the atomic mass. Alternatively, maybe I can get the mass of the Li-6 nucleus from known data. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01753 amu (atomic mass units). Oh wait, but I need it in GeV/c². I remember that 1 amu is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c².

So calculating Li-6's mass: 6.01753 amu * 0.9315 GeV/c²/amu. Let me calculate that. 6 * 0.9315 is about 5.589, and 0.01753 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.0163. So total is about 5.605 GeV/c². Wait, let me do exact calculation.

6.01753 * 0.9315 = let's compute this step by step.

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589
0.01753 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01632
So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.01632 = 5.60532 GeV/c². So m ≈ 5.60532 GeV/c².

Wait, but I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can find the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) times the number, but since it's a nucleus, using the exact mass via the atomic mass is more accurate.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So I need to find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. Correct. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

So the energy E is gamma * m * c². But since m is already in GeV/c², and c² is in units where c=1 when using GeV and such, maybe I can just multiply gamma by m.

Wait, m is 5.60532 GeV/c², so E = gamma * m c². Since m c² is in GeV (because (GeV/c²)*c² → GeV). So E = gamma * m c² → 3.5714 * 5.60532 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 *5.60532.

First, 3 *5.60532 is 16.81596.

0.5714 *5.60532 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.60532 = 2.80266 and 0.0714 *5.60532≈0.4015. So total is 2.80266 +0.4015 ≈ 3.20416.

So 16.81596 + 3.20416 ≈ 20.02012 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.02 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, let me check the mass of Li-6 again. The exact value might be more precise. Because 6.01753 amu multiplied by 0.931494 GeV/amu (I think the exact conversion is about 0.931494 GeV per amu).

So 6.01753 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute this:

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964

0.01753 * 0.931494: 0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494; 0.00753 *0.931494 is approximately 0.007029. So total is 0.00931494 + 0.007029 ≈ 0.0163439.

Adding to 5.588964 → 5.588964 + 0.0163439 = 5.605308 GeV/c².

So m is approximately 5.605308 GeV/c².

Gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.605308.

Calculating that:

Compute 3 *5.605308 = 16.815924

0.57142857 *5.605308: Let's break it down.

0.5 *5.605308 = 2.802654

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, which is about 0.07142857.

0.07142857 *5.605308 ≈ let's compute.

5.605308 *0.07 ≈ 0.39237156

5.605308 *0.001
