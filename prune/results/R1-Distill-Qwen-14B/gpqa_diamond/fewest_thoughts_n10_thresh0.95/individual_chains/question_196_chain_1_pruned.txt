Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects things.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't just use that straightforward formula.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The energy in relativity isn't just kinetic; it includes rest mass energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. So at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position, it's all kinetic.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA². But the kinetic energy can't be just (1/2)mv² because of the gamma factor. Relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA² + mc² (since the rest energy is part of the total), and at maximum speed, the potential is zero and the kinetic is (γ-1)mc².

Wait, no, wait. At maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, that's not right because in reality, the oscillator's energy is always the sum of KE and PE. Wait, no. In a harmonic oscillator, the energy is conserved. So at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so KE is zero, and all energy is PE: (1/2)kA². But in relativistic terms, I'm not sure if the potential energy is the same as in the classical case. Hmm, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so that's the same as the classical case. So the potential energy would be the integral of F, which is (1/2)kx², same as before.

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Wait, but in the classical case, the total energy is just (1/2)kA², which is all potential at x=A. But in relativity, the total energy is mc² plus the potential energy? Or is mc² part of the system's total energy?

Wait, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the classical potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA². But relativistically, kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So we set (γ -1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Solving for γ: (γ -1) = (k A²)/(2 mc²). So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we have:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let’s call it alpha: alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

Which can be rewritten as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v² = c² * [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But wait, let me think if I can approximate anything. Because if k A² is small compared to m c², then alpha is small, so perhaps we can expand terms. But the question doesn't specify that, so I think the answer must be exact.

But looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ). Hmm, perhaps I didn't go the right way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: The energy of the oscillator at any point is E = (1/2) k A² + mc². Because the maximum potential is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is mc². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, no, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, E is just (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is mc², which is constant. So the kinetic energy at x=0 would be (1/2)kA², which in the non-relativistic case is correct. But relativistically, KE is (γ-1) mc². So,

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is what I had before.

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + alpha.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

Let me solve for v.

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

v^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

But 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1/(1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) ≈ 1 - 2 alpha when alpha is small, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ] / denominator.

So numerator is 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So, v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so substituting:

v^2 = c^2 * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Simplify numerator:

2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes:

(k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = [ (4 m c²)(k A²) + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out (k A²/(2 m c²)) from numerator and denominator.

Let me factor alpha:

Numerator: (alpha) [ 2 + alpha ].

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so:

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)))^2.

Simplify numerator:

(k A^2/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c²))) = [k A^2/(2 m c²) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c²) ) ].

Wait, maybe I should just plug in the expression in terms of alpha and see if it matches any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )).

Wait, that would be sqrt( [1 + 1/(1 - beta)] ), where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, not sure. Let's compute v as we got it.

We have,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Which is,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

Expanding (1+alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So numerator is 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which can be written as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm. Let me see if that expression can be rewritten in a way that matches the options.

Wait, looking at option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )).

Let me compute that option's v^2.

Option B: v^2 = c^2 [ 1 + 1/(1 - alpha') ] where alpha' is (k A^2) / (2 m c^2).

Wait, alpha in my previous notation is the same as alpha' because alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - alpha')).

Wait, so v_max is c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - alpha')).

So:

v^2 = c² [ 1 + 1/(1 - alpha') ] = c² [ (1 - alpha' + 1 ) / (1 - alpha') ) ].

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 - alpha') = [ (1 - alpha') + 1 ] / (1 - alpha') ) = (2 - alpha') / (1 - alpha').

Hmm, but that doesn't match the expression I have for v^2.

Wait, let's compute my expression:

v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2 ) = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha).

But perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, let me write [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] as [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ].

Not sure. Maybe I'll compute each option's v^2 and see which one matches.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m )) )).

Wait, but in our problem, the term is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), not over 2m.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: [1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m)) ]^(1/2) * c.

Wait, the denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2m)), which is without c^2. That doesn't seem right dimensionally. Because k has units of N/m, which is kg/s². So k A² has units kg (since A is meters). 2m is kg, so (k A²)/(2m) is unitless. So that's okay. Hmm.

But in our expression, alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which has units (kg s^-2 m^2 ) / ( kg m^2/s² ) ) → (kg m²/s² ) / (kg m²/s² ) → unitless. So that makes sense.

But the term in option A is (k A^2)/(2 m ), which is (kg m²/s² ) / ( kg ) → m²/s². Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no: k has units N/m = kg/s². A² is m^2. So (k A^2) has units kg/s² * m^2 = kg m²/s². Divided by 2m, which is kg, gives (kg m²/s² ) / ( kg ) ) = m²/s². So the denominator in option A's sqrt would have units (1 - (m²/s²)), which is unitless, but that doesn't make sense because 1 is dimensionless and (m²/s²) is not. So perhaps option A has a mistake.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))).

So, the term inside is 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - x) = [ (1 -x) +1 ]/(1 -x) ) = (2 -x)/(1 -x).

So v_max = c sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Comparing with my expression, which is v^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2, where alpha = x = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let's compute (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Expand denominator: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

(2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 ) = [alpha (2 + alpha)] / ( (1 + alpha)^2 ).

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me take the expression in option B: v^2 = c^2 * (2 - x )/(1 - x ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2 = c² (2 - x) / (1 - x ) .

Compare with my expression:

v² = c² (2 x + x²) / (1 + x )^2.

So unless (2 - x)/(1 - x) equals (2x + x²)/(1 + x)^2, they are not the same.

Let me plug in x = alpha.

(2 - x)/(1 - x) = [2 - x]/[1 -x ].

(2x + x²)/(1 + x )^2 = [x(2 + x)]/(1 + x)^2.

Hmm, not the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the energy approach.

Alternative approach: The total energy in the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

So,

E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)k A².

But relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc².

So,

(γ-1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c²).

Thus,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c²).

Which is,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))².

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))² ].

Hmm, that's the same as before. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + x )² ] ), where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ).

Yes! That's exactly what I have.

Wait, let me check option D.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 ).

Which matches exactly.

But wait, in my calculation earlier, I thought option B was matching. But perhaps I messed up.

Wait, in my calculation, I computed v² as c² [1
