Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium, right? So, natural Lithium has different isotopes. Li-6 has 3 neutrons, so maybe X is Li-6? Or perhaps Li-7? Wait, no, 3 neutrons would make it Li-6 because Lithium has 3 protons normally. So the atomic number is 3, and 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals mass number 6, so X is Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which is a heavy ion. We need to find the energy of the RHIC when it's accelerated to 0.96c. Wait, no, the question is about the energy of the collider, which relates to the kinetic energy of the ions, I guess. Oh, right, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often a big part of the total energy, especially at high speeds.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy would be gamma m c², but the question is about the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes people refer to the total energy, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Because the speed is given, so we can find gamma, then compute the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps they mean the total energy, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The problem says 'energy of the RHIC'—RHIC is an accelerator, so it imparts kinetic energy to the ions. So I think the question is about the kinetic energy.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Use gamma to find the kinetic energy.

First, the rest mass of Li-6. The mass number A is 6, and the atomic number Z is 3 (since it's Li). So the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the total rest mass of the nucleus is (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass). Wait, but wait—actually, the binding energy is considered in the mass, but for heavy ions, the rest mass can be approximated as the sum of individual nucleon masses. But I think for the purpose of this problem, we can just add the individual masses.

So let's compute the rest mass m:

m = 3 * m_p + 3 * m_n.

m_p = 938.272 MeV/c²,
m_n = 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, wait, no. That's not right. Because the nucleus is Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the sum is 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n).

So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait, that's a lot. Let me check the actual mass of Li-6. Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy. But the problem probably expects us to use the sum of the individual masses, so I'll proceed with that.

So m = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, no. Wait, wait, 3*(m_p + m_n) gives that, but another approach: each proton is 938.272, each neutron 939.565, so:

m = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565)
= 3*(938.272 + 939.565)
= 3*(1877.837)
= 5633.511 MeV/c².

But wait, I remember that the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 amu. Let me double-check. Oh wait, because 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, so the actual mass would be different. But maybe the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or perhaps it's more precise to use the actual mass. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem is about the energy of the nucleus when moving at 0.96c. So the rest mass is the actual rest mass of the nucleus, not the sum of its nucleons.

So, let me look up the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it using the standard formula.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass can be found using the atomic mass of Li-6. The atomic mass includes electrons as well, but since the nucleus is being considered, perhaps we need to subtract the electrons.

Wait, no. The nucleus is a bare nucleus, so maybe the correct approach is to calculate the mass of the nucleus as:

mass of nucleus = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - binding energy.

But without exact data, perhaps the problem expects me to proceed with the sum of the individual masses. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the mass of the atom and adjust for electrons.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately 6.016 atomic mass units (amu). Since each amu is about 931.5 MeV/c², the mass would be 6.016 * 931.5 MeV/c².

But wait, the atom has electrons. The nucleus is Li-6, so the atomic number is 3, so it has 3 electrons. So the mass of the atom is approximately the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of the electrons. So the nucleus mass is approximately the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c², so three electrons contribute 1.533 MeV.

So the nucleus mass is approximately (6.016 amu * 931.5 MeV/c²/amu) minus (3 * 0.511 MeV/c²).

Wait, let me compute that.

6.016 * 931.5 = let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589, 0.016 *931.5≈14.904. So total is 5589 +14.904≈5603.904 MeV/c².

Subtract the electrons' mass: 3 * 0.511 = 1.533 MeV/c².

So nucleus mass m≈5603.904 - 1.533 = 5602.371 MeV/c².

Wait, that's about 5602.371 MeV, which is 5.602371 GeV/c².

Wait, that seems a bit high. But let me proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a table of isotopic masses I should refer to. But since I don't have access right now, I'll proceed with the approximation.

So m≈5.602 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, 5602 MeV is 5.602 GeV. Yep.

So m = 5.602 GeV/c².

Now, the speed is v = 0.96c.

We can compute gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, more accurately, 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma * m c².

Wait, but the energy is in GeV, and our m is in GeV/c². So when multiplied by c² (which is (GeV/c²)^-1 * GeV ), the GeV remains.

Wait, m c² is in GeV, so gamma * m c² is in GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c².

Which is 3.5714 * 5.602 GeV.

Compute that:

3 * 5.602 = 16.806
0.5714 *5.602 ≈ let's calculate:

5.602 *0.5 = 2.801
5.602 *0.0714 ≈ approx 5.602 *0.07 = 0.39214, 5.602 *0.0014=0.0078428 → total ≈ 0.39998.

So 2.801 + 0.39998 ≈3.20098.

So total E is 16.806 +3.20098 ≈ 20.00698 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV.

But wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, my approximated calculation gives around 20.007 GeV, but option C is 20.132. Close, but not exact. Let's see where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of gamma was approximate. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps more precise calculation is needed. Let's compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So that's accurate.

Wait, then perhaps my mass calculation was wrong. Because I used 5.602 GeV, but perhaps the correct rest mass is a bit different.

Let me double-check the rest mass of Li-6.

Looking up on the periodic table, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016 amu. But wait, that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons.

So to find the mass of the nucleus, we subtract the mass of the electrons.

Each Li atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is:

mass = (6.016 amu) - (3 * 0.00054858 amu) → because each electron is about 0.00054858 amu.

So 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 amu.

So nucleus mass ≈ 6.016 - 0.00164574 = 6.01435426 amu.

Wait, no, wait, wait: the mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 amu, so three electrons would be around 0.00164574 amu.

But wait, the atomic mass includes the electrons, but for the nucleus, we need to subtract those electrons' mass. So nucleus mass = atomic mass - electrons' mass.

So 6.016 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.01435426 amu.

Convert that to GeV/c²:

6.01435426 amu * 931.5 MeV/c²/amu = ?

Compute that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01435426 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.00435426 *931.5≈ ~4.063.

So total ≈9.315 +4.063=13.378.

So 5589 +13.378=5602.378 MeV =5.602378 GeV/c².

So m ≈5.602378 GeV/c².

So that's more precise. So m=5.602378 GeV/c².

Now, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.602378 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.602378.

Let me compute 3 *5.602378 =16.807134.

0.57142857 *5.602378:

Hmm, 5.602378 *0.5 =2.801189.

5.602378 *0.07142857 →0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.602378 * (1/14) =5.602378 /14= approx 0.400169857.

So 2.801189 +0.400169857=3.201358857.

So total E=16.807134 +3.201358857 =20.008492857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0085 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Hmm, but 20.008 is lower than 20.132. So perhaps I made an error in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the rest mass as just the sum of protons and neutrons without considering the binding energy.

So let me try that approach.

Earlier, I calculated the sum as 3 protons +3 neutrons:

3 * 938.272 MeV = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 MeV=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So m=5.633511 GeV/c².

Then, E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute that:

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857=approx 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577, and 5.633511 *0.00142857≈0.008047.

So total for 0.07142857: 0.39434577 + 0.008047≈0.40239277.

So 2.8167555 +0.40239277≈3.21914827.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21914827≈20.11968 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Because in the first approach, using the actual nucleus rest mass gives around 20.008 GeV, but using the sum of nucleons gives ~20.1197 GeV, which is closer to option C.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Because in accelerator physics, sometimes the rest mass is considered as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy for simplicity, especially for heavy ions.

So with that, E≈20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is very close.

Let me check the precise calculation again:

Gamma is exactly 3.5714285714 (since 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...).

m = 5.633511 GeV.

E = 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

I'll break it down.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.633511 = ?

Hmm,

0.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857 ≈ let's compute 0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857, 0.003511 *3.57142857≈0.0125333.

So total ≈0.107142857 +0.0125333≈0.119676.

So 2.142857142 +0.119676 ≈2.262533.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262533≈20.119676 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Close, but perhaps due to more precise mass calculations or perhaps I made a rounding error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Wait, because 0.96^2 is 0.9216, and 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because (0.28)^2=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714... So no error there.

So perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual masses, which gives E=20.1197 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy, but considers the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) * m c².

So if the question is about the kinetic energy, then K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.633511 GeV.

So 2.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *5.633511=11.267022.

0.57142857 *5.633511= as before, approximately 3.219148.

So total K=11.267022 +3.219148=14.48617 GeV.

But that's nowhere near the options given, which are all around 18-23 GeV. So I must have misunderstood.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy, not the kinetic. So the earlier calculation of E=20.1197 GeV is correct, and the option is C)20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Let me try to find the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160293 amu.

So converting that to GeV/c²:

6.0160293 amu *931.5 MeV/c²/amu = ?

Compute:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.0060293 *931.5≈5.633.

So total is 5589 +9.315=5598.315 +5.633=5603.948 MeV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 6.0160293 amu is the mass of the atom, so the nucleus's mass is 6.0160293 amu minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron is 0.00054858 amu, so 3 electrons are 0.00164574 amu.

So nucleus mass =6.0160293 - 0.00164574 =6.01438356 amu.

Convert that to GeV/c²: 6.01438356 *931.5 MeV/c².

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01438356 *931.5 = let me compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00438356 *931.5 = approx 4.090.

So total 9.315 +4.090=13.405 MeV.

So total m c² =5589 +13.405=5602.405 MeV =5.602405 GeV/c².

So m=5.602405 GeV/c².

Then, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.602405 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.602405.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.602405 =16.807215.

0.57142857 *5.602405.

Compute 0.5 *5.602405 =2.8012025.

0.07142857 *5.602405:

Compute 5.602405 *0.07 =0.39216835.

5.602405 *0.00142857 ≈0.008002.

So total is 0.39216835 +0.008002≈0.400170.

So 0.57142857 *5.602405≈2.8012025 +0.400170≈3.2013725.

So total E=16.807215 +3.2013725≈20.0085875 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0086 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the sum of the masses, which would be 5.6335 GeV. Let me recalculate with that.

E=3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0335 *3.57142857≈0.1197.

So 2.142857142 +0.1197≈2.262557.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.262557≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is about 20.1197 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a calculation error, or the problem expects more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571428571... So that's exact.

Hmm, so perhaps the issue is with the mass I'm using. Let me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 isotope is about 6.014354648 amu.

So converting that to GeV/c²:

6.014354648 amu *931.5 MeV/amu = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.014354648 *931.5 = approximately:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.004354648 *931.5 ≈4.062.

So total 9.315 +4.062=13.377 MeV.

So 5589 +13.377=5602.377 MeV=5.602377 GeV/c².

So m=5.602377 GeV/c².

Again, E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.602377 GeV.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.602377.

Wait, wait, 5.602377 is 5 +0.602377.

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.602377.

Wait, 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.002377 *3.57142857≈0.008455.

So total 2.142857142 +0.008455≈2.151312.

So E=17.85714285 +2.151312=20.00845485 GeV.

Again, about 20.0085 GeV.

Hmm, but all of these calculations lead me to think that the correct answer is approximately 20.0085 GeV, but none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the sum of protons and neutrons' masses without considering the nucleus binding energy. That would give m=5.6335 GeV/c², leading to E=3.5714 *5.6335 ≈20.119 GeV. That's very close to option C:20.132.

So perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute gamma*m with m=5.6335 GeV/c².

3.57142857 *5.6335.

Let me compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0335 *3.57142857≈
