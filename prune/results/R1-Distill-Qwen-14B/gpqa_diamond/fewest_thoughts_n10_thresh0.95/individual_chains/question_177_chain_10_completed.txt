Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Additionally, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. We're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and compute how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2. The options are A to D with some numbers.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. Since 4πσ is a constant, when comparing two stars, the ratio of their luminosities depends on R squared times T to the fourth power.

So, the first thing I need to find is the temperatures of both stars. But wait, how do I find the temperatures? The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! Black body radiation peaks at a wavelength given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant. The constant is approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = constant / T, so if λ_max is the same, T is the same. Oh, that's a key point. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says they are the same in their wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So that must be the λ_max for each star. So yes, T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but what about the radial velocities? The problem gives radial velocities for the two stars, Star_1 is at 0 km/s, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, wait, maybe the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect. Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. So the observed maximum wavelength we see would be different from the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps after accounting for the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same for both. Let me think. So for each star, we have:

λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)

where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if a star is moving towards us, the observed λ is shorter, and if moving away, it's longer. So let me clarify.

If Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s (since radial velocity is positive when moving away?), then the observed λ would be λ2 = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c). But wait, the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's observed λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's is λ2, and they're same. So λ1 = λ2.

But Star_1's rest wavelength is λ1_rest, and Star_2's is λ2_rest. Then, considering Doppler shift:

λ1 = λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c)
λ2 = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c)

But given that λ1 = λ2, and v1_r is 0, v2_r is 700 km/s. So let me write:

λ1 = λ1_rest * (1 + 0) = λ1_rest
λ2 = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But c is the speed of light, about 3e5 km/s. So 700e3 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 7/300 ≈ 0.002333. So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So λ2 = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

But since λ1 = λ2, we have λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, λ1_rest = constant / T1, and λ2_rest = constant / T2. Since the stars' rest wavelengths are different, but after Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same. So:

λ1_rest = (2.898e-3 m·K) / T1
λ2_rest = (2.898e-3 m·K) / T2

But from the Doppler equation, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

So substituting,

(2.898e-3)/(T1) = (2.898e-3)/(T2) * 1.002333

Divide both sides by 2.898e-3:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333

Which is approximately T1 = T2 * (1 - 0.002333), but maybe it's better to compute it directly.

Wait, 1.002333 is approximately 1.002333, so 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ 0.99768 * T2.

So Star_1's temperature is slightly less than Star_2's. But wait, earlier assumption from the same λ_max before considering Doppler shift was that T1 = T2. But that's only true in their rest frames. The observed λ_max is same, but their rest λ_max are different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The observed wavelength maximum is the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. But λ_obs1 is λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r/c) and λ_obs2 is λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r/c).

Given that Star_1's v_r is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ1_rest.

Star_2's v_r is 700 km/s away, so λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / c )

Set them equal: λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But λ1_rest = (2.898e-3 m K)/T1, and λ2_rest = (2.898e-3 m K)/T2.

So substituting:

(2.898e-3)/(T1) = (2.898e-3)/(T2) * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Simplify 700e3 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So,

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * 1.002333

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ 0.99768 T2.

Wait, that's a small difference, but it's there. So the temperatures aren't exactly the same. So earlier assumption was wrong, but for a rough approximation, maybe this difference is negligible. But since the problem gives precise options, perhaps it's not negligible, and we should account for it. Hmm.

But wait, the problem says to assume that the stars radiate as black bodies, and the luminosity is computed based on that. So I think the key here is that the observed λ_max is same, but their actual temperatures are different because of Doppler shift. So we have to calculate their actual (rest frame) temperatures, which are different, and then compute their luminosities.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and that they are the same. So the observed wavelengths are same, which includes Doppler shift. So the stars' rest wavelengths are different, but after accounting for Doppler, they have same observed λ_max.

So to find T1 and T2, we need to use their observed λ_max, but I'm a bit confused about how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the rest frame of each star. For each star, the peak emission wavelength is given by Wien's law. So for Star 1, λ1_rest = 2.898e-3 m·K / T1.

Similarly, for Star 2, λ2_rest = 2.898e-3 m·K / T2.

But when we observe Star 2 moving away at 700 km/s, the observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

But the problem says that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. Since Star_1 has v_r =0, λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c )

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Compute (700e3)/(3e5) = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333...

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.0023333...

But λ1_rest = (2.898e-3)/T1, and λ2_rest = (2.898e-3)/T2.

So,

(2.898e-3)/T1 = (2.898e-3)/T2 * 1.0023333...

Divide both sides by 2.898e-3:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.0023333...

Which leads to T1 = T2 / 1.0023333... ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 is a bit lower than T2. So temperature of Star_1 is lower than Star_2.

But wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think again. Since the observed λ_max is same, but after Doppler shift, perhaps we can calculate the effective temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but when computing the actual luminosity, we need to consider the rest frame.

Wait, the problem states that after determining the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are same. But when we compute luminosity, which depends on the star's intrinsic properties (radius and temperature), we have to consider their rest temperatures, not the observed.

Wait, no, the temperature used in the luminosity formula is the effective temperature of the star, which is in its rest frame. So to compute L1 and L2, we need T1 and T2, the rest temperatures.

So, from the Doppler shift, we've found that T1 = T2 * 0.99768.

So now, we can proceed to compute the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given:

R1 = 1.5 R2

T1 = 0.99768 T2

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² * (0.99768 T2)^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * (0.99768^4 T2^4 ) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

The R2² and T2^4 terms cancel out.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.99768)^4

Compute 0.99768^4.

Hmm. Let me approximate.

0.99768 is approximately 0.9977.

So 0.9977^2 = (approx) (1 - 0.0023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 0.9954 + 0.000005 ≈ 0.9954.

So (0.9977)^2 ≈ 0.9954.

Then, (0.9977)^4 = (0.9954)^2 ≈ 0.9909.

So approximately 0.9909.

But more accurately, perhaps:

Wait, 0.99768 is approximately 0.9977.

Calculating 0.9977^4:

First, 0.9977^2 = ?

0.9977 * 0.9977:

Let me compute it accurately.

(1 - 0.0023)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0023 + 0.0023^2 = 1 - 0.0046 + 0.00000529 = 0.9954 + 0.00000529 = 0.99540529.

Then, 0.99540529^2 = ?

Again, (1 - 0.00459471)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00459471 + (0.00459471)^2.

= 1 - 0.00918942 + 0.00002112.

Which is approximately 0.99081068.

So 0.9977^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908.

Calculate 2.25 * 0.9908.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0008 = 0.0018.

Wait, no, 0.9908 is 0.99 + 0.0008.

Wait, 0.9908 = 1 - 0.0092.

So,

2.25 * (1 - 0.0092) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.0092) = 2.25 - 0.0207 ≈ 2.2293.

So approximately 2.2293.

But wait, the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, option D is ~2.23, which is very close to our approximation.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation of 0.99768^4 is a bit rough. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using logarithms or exponents.

Let me compute (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.002324 (since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x³/3 for small x. Here x=0.00232.)

So ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.002324.

Then, ln( (0.99768)^4 ) = 4 * (-0.002324) = -0.009296.

Exponentiating that, e^(-0.009296) ≈ 1 - 0.009296 + (0.009296^2)/2.

0.009296^2 is approx 8.64e-5.

So e^-0.009296 ≈ 1 - 0.009296 + 0.0000432 ≈ 0.990747.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.990747.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990747 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990747.

Compute 2.25 * 0.990747:

2 * 0.990747 = 1.981494.

0.25 * 0.990747 = 0.24768675.

Adding together: 1.981494 + 0.24768675 ≈ 2.22918.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait a minute, I thought initially that the temperatures were same, but they are actually not. So the Doppler shift introduces a small difference in the temperatures, which in turn affects the luminosity.

Wait, but why is the radial velocity of Star_2 away from us? How does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh, wait, perhaps the observed flux is affected, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming black body radiation, so perhaps we're to compute the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

But when calculating L, the luminosity is an intrinsic property, so yes, we need to use the rest temperatures and radii.

So yes, our calculation of L1/L2 being approximately 2.23 seems correct.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23, so that would be the answer.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \). The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift. For Star_1, the radial velocity is \( v_{1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), so the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{1, \text{rest}}
\]

For Star_2, the radial velocity is \( v_{2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{2, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{2, \text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{2, \text{obs}} \)):

\[
\lambda_{1, \text{rest}} = \lambda_{2, \text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{1, \text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \) and \( \lambda_{2, \text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T_2} \):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Canceling \( b \) and solving for \( T_1 \):

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

The speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.99768
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the luminosity ratio
The radii are given as \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left( \frac{1}{0.99768} \right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (1.002333)^4
\]

Using \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.0093 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 1.0093 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
