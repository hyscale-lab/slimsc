Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of it has dark spots covering 20% of the area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that these spots cause photometric variations when the star rotates, which can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp / R*)^2, where Rp is planet radius and R* is star radius. That's because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots that are darker. When a spot comes into view as the star rotates, it changes the observed brightness. Since the spots are cooler, they emit less light. So when the spot is facing us, the star's total brightness would decrease because the spot is blocking hotter (brighter) regions.

So the problem is comparing the brightness variation caused by these spots to that of a planet transit. The question is, what's the planet radius needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Let me break down the given data:

- Star radius R* = Sun's radius. Let's call that R_sun.

- Filling factor (f) = 20% or 0.2. That's the fraction of the hemisphere covered in spots.

- Temperature of spots (T_spot) = 6000K -1000K = 5000K? Wait, no, wait. The temperature difference is 1000K, but what's the exact setup? The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The hemisphere is covered in spots, but only one hemisphere. So the spots are on one side, and when the star rotates, that side comes into view and then goes away. So the photometric variation would be due to the spots being visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but how does this affect the observed brightness? The star's brightness when spots are visible depends on the spots' area and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

The key here is to calculate the change in brightness when a spot is visible. But wait, the problem says that this setup can "closely resemble" the presence of an exoplanet. So the variation in brightness due to the spots is being compared to the variation due to a planet transiting.

So the question is: what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Let me model the situation.

When the star is not blocked by spots, its total brightness is L* = 4π R*^2 σ Teff^4.

But when a spot is present, part of the star is emitting less. The spot's area is f * (hemisphere area). Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is f * (2π R*^2 / 2) = f π R*^2? Wait, no, a hemisphere is 2π R², right? So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the total spot area is 0.4 π R², which is 0.1 of the star's surface area. Because 0.4 π is 0.4/(4) of the total area. 0.4/(4) is 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Wait, no, because the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So one hemisphere is half the star's surface (2π R²), and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Compare to total surface area 4π R², so 0.4 π / 4 π = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots.

Wait, but the star is rotating, and only one hemisphere is covered. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots come into view as the star rotates. So the maximum brightness loss would be when the maximum area of spots is visible. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star is rotating so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are between us and the star's surface, blocking some light.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would rotate in and out of view. So the brightness variation would be a dip when the spots are in front, and a rise when they're not.

But to model this, the brightness change would be due to the spots covering part of the star's surface. The change in brightness (ΔL) would be the difference between the star's total brightness when spots are not visible and when they are.

But wait, the spots are cooler. So when the spots are on the face, they contribute less light. So the observed flux would be the normal flux minus the flux from the spots times the area covered, plus the flux from the cooler spots. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's total emitted flux is L = 4π R*^2 σ Teff^4. The flux per unit area (like per square meter) is σ Teff^4. So the spots have a lower flux per unit area: σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be:

L = (1 - f) * (normal flux) + f * (spot flux) 

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The star emits light uniformly except for the spots. So when the spots are visible, part of the star's surface (area A = f * (hemisphere area)) is at a lower temperature. So the total flux is the sum of the normal regions and the spots.

But wait, the star's hemisphere is covered with spots. So the area of the spots is f * (hemisphere area) = f * 2π R*² / 2? Hmm, not sure I'm getting the area right. Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But the star's total surface area is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star covered in spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots.

Wait, that's the same as if the entire star had 10% coverage. But in this case, it's only on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are only visible when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, which is half the time, right? Or maybe not, because the star is rotating, and the spots come into and out of view as it spins.

But regardless, the maximum dip in brightness would be when the entire spotty area is blocking the view, but I think the problem is considering the maximum variation when the spots are in front.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the brightness change.

The star without spots has a flux of F = σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux from the star is F_total = (1 - f) * F + f * σ (T_spot)^4.

Wait, no. Let me model the flux as the sum of the normal regions and the spots.

The flux from the normal regions is (1 - f) * (σ Teff^4) * (R*²). Wait, no. Wait, the star's total flux is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. When part of it is covered with spots, the flux is L = (1 - f) * L_normal + f * L_spot.

Wait, no, because the spots are only on a part of the star. So the total flux is:

L = L_normal * (1 - f) + L_spot * f

Where L_normal is the flux per unit area (Teff^4 σ) times the area not covered by spots. Wait, no, L_normal is the same as the star's flux, but when a portion is cooler.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of fractional change in brightness.

The star's normal brightness is L = 4π R*^2 σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the brightness is:

L' = L - (area of spots) * (σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)).

Wait, because each spot is cooler, so the flux from that area is less by σ T_spot^4 compared to σ Teff^4.

Wait, that makes sense. So the change in flux is:

ΔL = - (A_spots) * σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

But A_spots is f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R*² = 0.4 π R*².

So:

ΔL = - (0.4 π R*²) * σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

The fractional change in flux is ΔL / L.

L is 4 π R*² σ (6000)^4.

So fractional change:

(ΔL / L) = [ - 0.4 π R*² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 π R*² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify:

The R*², σ, and π terms cancel.

= [ -0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

= [ -0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

But wait, maybe I can factor it.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So:

ΔL/L = [ -0.4 * 6.71e14 ] / [4 * 1.296e15 ]

= [ -0.4 * 6.71 ] / [4 * 1.296 ] * (1e14 / 1e15 ) 

Wait, 1e14/1e15= 0.1.

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

0.4 * 6.71 = approx 2.684.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296 = 5.184.

So:

ΔL/L ≈ (-2.684) / 5.184 * 0.1

≈ (-0.517) * 0.1 ≈ -0.0517 or about -5.17%.

Wait, but this is the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present. But the star's brightness would dip by about 5.17% when the spots are visible.

But wait, the problem states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the dip caused by the planet would be the same amplitude, 5.17%?

Wait, but wait: when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, similar to the spots blocking their own light. So the dip in brightness for the planet would be (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Because the area blocked is (π Rp^2)/(4 π Rstar^2) )= (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2). So the fractional dip is (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2) * (L per unit area as the star's flux), but since the star's brightness is L = 4 π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4, the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * (σ Teff^4) * (π Rp^2 / 4 π Rstar^2) ) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. The dip in brightness is the area of the planet (relative to the star) times the star's surface brightness. So the fractional dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Because the planet blocks a circle of area π Rp^2, and the star's area is π (Rstar)^2, so the ratio is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = fractional change, which should match the 5.17% dip from the spots.

Wait, but wait. When the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2), as area scales with radius squared.

So in this problem, the dip caused by the spots is 5.17% of the star's brightness. We want a planet that causes the same dip.

So:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ sqrt(0.05) ≈ 0.2236.

Wait, but wait, the calculation earlier gave a dip of about 5.17%, so the planet would need to have (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517, so Rp ≈ sqrt(0.0517) Rstar.

Wait, sqrt(0.0517) is approximately 0.2275.

Wait but looking at the options: the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32. Hmm, none of these is ~0.2275. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the dip calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the fractional change in brightness due to the spots.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. The problem states that the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total area of the star is 4 π R².

So the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1, or 10%.

So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, when the star is rotating, the spotty hemisphere comes into view. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots rotate in and out of view, causing a dip when the spots are in front.

But when the star isn't covered by spots, the brightness is L. When the spots are in front, the brightness is L' = L - (spot area)*(Teff^4 - T_spot^4)* σ.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the spots being cooler, so when they are in front, the star's observed flux is lower.

Wait, the star's flux without spots is L = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is:

L' = [ (1 - 0.1) * Teff^4 + 0.1 * T_spot^4 ] * 4 π R² σ

Wait, no. Because 10% of the surface is spots, each spot has a temperature of T_spot = 5000 K.

So the total flux is:

L' = 4 π R² σ [ (1 - 0.1) * (6000)^4 + 0.1 * (5000)^4 ]

So the fractional change is [ (0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 * 5000^4 ) / (6000^4) ] - 1.

Wait, because the original L = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So (L' / L) = 0.9 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

(5/6) is approximately 0.8333; (0.8333)^2 ≈ 0.6944, then squared again is about 0.482.

So 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.482 = 0.9 + 0.0482 = 0.9482.

So L' = 0.9482 L.

So the fractional dip is (L - L')/L = 1 - 0.9482 = 0.0518, or 5.18%.

So that matches the earlier calculation.

Now, the dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Then Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Hmm, looking at the options, the closest one is option C) ~0.11 or D) ~0.32. Wait, 0.2276 is approximately 0.23, which is between option D (0.32) and perhaps another option, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the star's brightness variation due to the spots is a dip when the spots are in front, but perhaps the maximum variation is when the entire hemisphere is visible. Or perhaps I should model the amplitude as the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, but when the star is not covered, the brightness is L. When the spots are in front, it's L' = 0.9482 L. So the dip is 5.18%.

So the planet would need to cause the same dip. So the planet's radius would be Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518, which is about 0.0518, so Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, so about 0.23.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32, which is higher. Option C is 0.11, which is lower. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (5/6)^4 exactly.

5/6 is 0.833333...

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈0.694444.

(25/36)^2 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.482253 = 0.9482253.

So fractional dip is 0.0517747, approximately 5.177%.

So the planet's radius squared over star radius squared is 0.0517747.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm. So 0.2275 Rstar.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the brightness variation is not just the spot area, but the maximum variation when the spot is fully in front of the star. But wait, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the maximum brightness variation occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, but the other time it's not.

Wait, perhaps when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are only visible when the star is rotated in a certain way. So the maximum dip in brightness is 5.18%, as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeling it differently. Instead of the spot's lower flux, perhaps the question is considering the spot blocking the same amount of light as a black area, i.e., that the spot doesn't emit any light. But that's not the case; the spots are just cooler, so they emit less, not zero.

Wait, perhaps the way to model it is that the spots are dark, so when they are in front, they block the underlying bright areas. But the star's flux isn't just the spots' flux, but the underlying flux from the rest of the star plus the spots' contribution.

Another approach: The star's flux when not spotted is L = 4π R*² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is L' = [ (1 - f) * (6000)^4 + f * (5000)^4 ] * 4 π R*² σ.

So, L' = 4 π R*² σ [ (1 - 0.1) * (6000^4) + 0.1 * (5000^4) ].

Which is the same as before.

So the fractional dip is (L - L')/L = 1 - [ (0.9 *6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4) / 6000^4 ]

= 1 - [ 0.9 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 ]

= 0.05177, as before.

So the dip is about 5.177%.

Now, the planet's dip is (Rp/R* )^2.

So Rp/R* = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39 --> 0.39^2 = 0.1521 --> 15% dip. No.

B) ~0.07 --> 0.0049 dip. No.

C) ~0.11 --> 0.0121 dip. No.

D) ~0.32 --> 0.1024 dip. Hmm, 10.24% dip.

Wait, none of the options match 5.17%. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the dark spot as blocking the light, but perhaps the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler, but when they are on the far side of the star, the star's brightness appears higher because the spots are not facing us. Wait, no, that's not correct. The spots are on the surface, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the brightness variation is when the spots are in front (dip) and when they are not (no dip). So the dip is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only part of the spots come into view, leading to a smaller dip. Wait, but earlier I assumed that the entire 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots and when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots come into view fully.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a spot that is a circle of radius r on the star's surface. But no, the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, meaning 10% of the star's surface is covered.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the brightness variation when the spots rotate into view is that the star's apparent brightness changes. The maximum dip is when all the spots are in front of the star. So the dip is 5.177%, as calculated.

Now, the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we have (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177. So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is 0.32. But that's 0.1024 dip, which is bigger than 0.05177. Hmm, that's about double.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot area. Let me double-check.

Filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.4 π R². The total star area is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is when the star is viewed, only half of the spots are visible at any time. Because the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings the spotty hemisphere into view, the spots are on the near side, and when it's on the far side, they're not visible. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the hemisphere is fully visible, leading to a dip of 10% of the star's surface area. But that's what I calculated earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed, only half the spots are visible. No, that's not correct. When the star's spotty hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are in front, leading to maximum dip. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the back hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, so no dip.

So the dip is when the spotty hemisphere is in view. So the dip is 5.177%, as before.

So the planet's radius must be 0.2275 Rstar.

Looking at the options, the closest is not present. So perhaps the options are using a different approach. Maybe the problem is considering the spots as blocking the star's light, making the star appear dimmer when the spots are in the line of sight, but perhaps the approach is to model the brightness change as when the planet transits, blocking a part of the star. So the area blocked is the planet's area relative to the star's area, leading to a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the dip due to the spots is 5.17%, so the planet's dip must also be 5.17%, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517)≈0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius such that its transit causes the same brightness variation as the spots do. So when the star is not covered by spots, the dip is 5.17%. So the planet would have to cause a dip of 5.17%.

But according to the options, perhaps the intended approach was to model the dip as the area of the spots over the star's area, so 10% (0.1), leading to a dip of 10%. Then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1)≈0.316, which is option D (~0.32). But wait, that's not matching the actual dip calculated earlier, which was 5.17%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot as a hotter region, but that's not the case here because the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the star's brightness when the spots are visible. Let me re-express the brightness.

The star's total flux when the spots are visible would be:

L' = (L * (1 - f) ) + (f * L_spot )

Where L_spot is the flux from the spots, which is f_spot * L (where f_spot is the fraction of the star's surface covered in spots, which is 10%).

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as:

Flux without spots: L = 4π R*² σ (6000)^4.

Flux when spots are visible: L' = (1 - 0.1) * L + 0.1 * [ σ (5000)^4 * (4 π R*²) ) ] / (4 π R*²) ) ] 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the flux as:

L' = (1 - 0.1) * (σ (6000)^4) + 0.1 * (σ (5000)^4 )

Then multiply by 4 π R*² to get the total flux.

So:

L' = 4 π R*² σ [ 0.9 * (6000)^4 + 0.1 * (5000)^4 ]

Which is the same as before.

So the dip is 5.177% as computed.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's think about the problem again.

The problem states that the star's one hemisphere is covered with spots (filling factor 20%). So the spot area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area).

Hemisphere area is 2 π R², so 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R², so the fraction covered is 0.1.

So when the star is viewed face-on to the spotty hemisphere, the entire 10% of the surface is in view, leading to a dip in brightness.

But wait, perhaps the star's rotation is such that when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the limb, so only a fraction of them is visible. Oh wait, but the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the spots are on the surface. So when the star rotates, the entire spot comes into view. No, that's not correct. When the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would transit across the star's disk, but the portion of the spots visible depends on the viewing angle.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it, but the problem states that the star is being observed in such a way that the spot's hemisphere rotation causes the brightness variations. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire 10% of the star's surface is in front of us.

In that case, the dip is 5.177%, as before.

So the planet's radius would need to be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp = 0.2275 Rstar.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is option C: ~0.11, which is 0.11^2 = 0.0121, which is about 1.2% dip, which doesn't match. Option D is 0.32, which is 0.1024 dip, which is a 10.24% dip. That's larger than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me recheck the fractional dip.

Wait, when the star's 10% of the surface is cooler, the fractional dip is:

ΔL/L = (1 - 0.9) * (6000^4 - 5000^4) / 6000^4.

Wait no, the correct formula is:

ΔL/L = [ (1 - 0.1) * 6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4 ] / 6000^4 -1

Which is:

[0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4 ] / 6000^4 -1

= 0.9 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 -1

= 0.1*(5/6)^4 -0.1

= 0.1 [ (5/6)^4 - 1 ]

Wait, no! Wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

[0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4 ] / 6000^4 = 0.9 + 0.1*(5000^4 /6000^4 )

So:

= 0.9 + 0.1*(5/6)^4

= 0.9 + 0.1*(625/1296)

= 0.9 + (0.1 * 0.482253) 

= 0.9 + 0.0482253 = 0.9482253.

So L' = 0.9482253 L.

So the dip is (L - L')/L = 1 - 0.9482253 = 0.0517747, which is ~5.177%.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32, but that would be a dip of (0.32)^2 = 0.1024, which is about 10.24% dip. That's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the spot's contribution. What if the spots are not emitting at all (i.e., they're completely black, emitting zero flux)?

Wait, but the problem states that the spots are cooler, but not completely black. So they still emit some flux, just less than the surrounding areas.

If I model the spots as black, then the flux would be:

L' = (1 - 0.1) * L + 0.1 * 0.

So L' = 0.9 L.

So dip is 10%, which would require Rp^2/Rstar^2 = 0.1 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈0.316, which is approximately 0.32. So option D.

But in reality, the spots are not black; they emit some flux, so the dip is less than 10%. So the correct dip should be ~5.17%, requiring a smaller planet radius.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem intended the spots to be modeled as black, leading to a dip of 10%, which would match option D.

But in reality, the spots are cooler, not black. So the correct calculation gives a smaller dip, leading to a smaller planet radius.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the flux from the star as the sum of the normal flux and the flux from the spots. But when the spots rotate into view, their flux is added to the total. Wait, that can't be right because the spots are cooler, so their flux is less than the surrounding areas. So when they rotate into view, the total flux decreases.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the dip in brightness when the spots are in view is similar to that of a planet transiting.

The dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The dip caused by the spots is when the star's brightness decreases due to the spots being in view.

So I think my earlier approach is correct, leading to the planet radius being approximately 0.2275 Rstar, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the intended approach was to model the spot area as 10% of the star's surface and model the dip as 10%, leading to Rp = sqrt(0.1) Rstar ≈ 0.316 Rstar, which is option D (~0.32).

But why would the problem model the spots as black? Because in that case, the dip would be 10%, but in reality, the dip is less. So perhaps the options intended this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the spot area as 20% (filling factor) of the star's total area, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, that is, if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R². So 20% of the star's surface is covered.

In that case, the dip would be:

ΔL/L = [0.8 * (5000/6000)^4 + 0.2 * 1 ] - 1.

Wait, no, correct formula:

ΔL/L = [ (1 - 0.2) *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ] / 6000^4 -1

= 0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 -1

= 0.8 + 0.2*(625/1296) -1 

= 0.8 + 0.2*(0.482253) -1 

= 0.8 + 0.0964506 -1 

= 0.8964506 -1 = -0.1035494.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute correctly.

Wait, (5/6)^4 is 625/1296 ≈0.482253.

So:

0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 = 6000^4 (0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 )

Divide by 6000^4:

0.8 + 0.2 *0.482253 = 0.8 + 0.0964506 = 0.8964506.

So L' = 0.8964506 L.

So dip is 1 - 0.8964506 = 0.1035494, about 10.35% dip.

So in this case, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 Rstar, which is option D.

But wait, in this scenario, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just one hemisphere. But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

So this would be incorrect, but perhaps the problem intended to model it this way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the intended approach was to calculate the dip as (area of spots) / (star area), which is 0.1, leading to a dip of 10%, requiring Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D, ~0.32.

But according to the detailed calculation considering the spots' temperature, the dip is about 5.17%, leading to a planet radius of ~0.227 Rstar, which isn't an option.

But given the options, and perhaps the intended approach, the answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information and Approach:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius of the star, \( R_* \), is equal to the Sun's radius.  
   - Effective temperature, \( T_{\text{eff}} \), is 6000 K.  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  

2. **Spot Properties**:  
   - Temperature of the spots, \( T_{\text{spot}} \), is 1000 K cooler than the star, i.e., \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to the hemisphere, so the total area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface.  

3. **Brightness Variation**:  
   - The star's total brightness without spots is \( L = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).  
   - When the spots are visible, the brightness decreases due to their lower temperature. The new brightness is:  
     \[
     L' = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma \left[ (1 - 0.1) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.1 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right]
     \]
   - The fractional change in brightness is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L} = 1 - \frac{L'}{L} = 1 - \left[ 0.9 + 0.1 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L} = 1 - \left[ 0.9 + 0.1 \cdot 0.482 \right] = 1 - 0.9482 = 0.0518 \, \text{(or 5.18%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:  
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2
     \]
   - Setting the dip caused by the planet equal to the dip caused by the spots:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2 = 0.0518
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_*} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.2275
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - The calculated radius ratio \( R_p / R_* \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.  
   - The closest option is **D) ~0.32**, which corresponds to a dip of approximately \( (0.32)^2 = 0.1024 \) or 10.24%.  
   - This discrepancy suggests that the problem may have intended the spots to be modeled as completely black (emitting no light), leading to a larger dip of 10% and matching option D.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided options and the likely intended approach, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots is approximately **0.32**.
