Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Okay, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth when we go around the Sun. The formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So higher parallax means the star is closer to us.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Oh right, I think in astronomy, when we say stars are uniformly distributed in space, it means that their density doesn't change with distance. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. But wait, in reality, stars are not perfectly uniformly distributed, but this is a hypothetical scenario.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking for how N, the count of stars, changes with plx, the parallax. Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance, and how that affects the number of stars in a given parallax bin.

Since parallax plx = 1/d, distance d is inversely proportional to plx. So as plx increases (meaning closer stars), d decreases. Conversely, as plx decreases (more distant stars), d increases.

In a uniform distribution of stars, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote this number density as n. So in a small volume element, the number of stars would be n multiplied by the volume.

But how does the volume relate to parallax? Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dd. But wait, since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/(plx²)) d plx, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again: Let's express the volume in terms of plx. The shell's volume is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in distance. But since parallax is inversely related, when plx changes by dplx, what's the corresponding change in d?

We have d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/plx² * dplx. Wait, but I'm considering a small interval of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the range of parallax. Let's say we have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). But this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. So the volume is 4πd² * dd, but I need to express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx². But what is dd in terms of dplx?

From plx = 1/d, differentiating both sides: d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, solving for dd: dd = -d² d plx. Substituting d = 1/plx, dd = -(1/plx²) d plx.

Now, the volume of the shell is 4πd² * dd. Substituting d²=1/plx² and dd= - (1/plx²) d plx, the volume becomes:

4π*(1/plx²) * (-1/plx² d plx) = -4π/(plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but the negative sign indicates the direction of change, but since we're dealing with the magnitude, we can take the absolute value. So the volume is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx.

But wait, the number of stars is the volume multiplied by the number density, n. So number of stars N in the shell between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * Volume.

Which is N = n * (4π/(plx^4)) d plx. So N is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx.

But the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. That is, the number in a bin of dplx=1 (assuming plx is in some unit). So N per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait a second, but the options don't have 1/plx^4. Option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's an option. But let me think if I did everything correctly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the volume.

Volume V = 4πd² * dd. Since d = 1/plx, V = 4π(1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is the change in distance. Since plx is changing, how do I express dd in terms of d plx?

We have d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Differentiating, d plx = - (1/d²) dd, so dd = -d² d plx.

Substituting into V: V = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-d² d plx).

Wait, since d = 1/plx, d squared is 1/plx². So:

V = 4π (1/plx^2) * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ].

So V = -4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Taking the absolute value, V = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Thus, the number of stars in a shell at parallax plx with a small thickness d plx is N = n * V = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (d plx = 1) is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but the options have 1/plx^4 as option A. But I'm having a moment of doubt here because I thought earlier it might be 1/plx^3. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Maybe considering that the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume, and volume in terms of distance is a spherical shell with volume 4πd² dd.

Since the number density is constant, the number of stars in a shell is 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density. But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx².

But how does dd relate to d plx? We have d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx. Substituting d=1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So the shell's volume is 4πd² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 d plx) ) → which is -4π/(plx^4) d plx. Absolute value gives 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

Hence, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that's the same conclusion. So the number per unit parallax (d plx =1) is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when considering counts, the effect of the area might be a factor. Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the differential in parallax and the actual volume.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the density isn't uniform in parallax space, but in distance space. Let me think in terms of differential counts.

The number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx is dN = n * 4πd² dd.

But we have dd in terms of dplx. Let me write d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx )

= n * 4π * (-1) / plx^4 * dplx.

Taking absolute value, dN = (4 π n) / plx^4 dplx.

So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So yes, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing up the concepts. Another approach: think about how the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on distance.

At a certain distance d, the volume shell between d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. The number of stars in this shell is n * 4πd² dd, where n is number density.

But since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d.

So, 4πd² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

= 4π ( -1/plx^4 ) d plx.

So again, the same result.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. In a hypothetical scenario where stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density: 

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd.
\]

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( d^2 \) as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Additionally, \( dd \) can be related to \( d\text{plx} \) through differentiation: \( d\text{plx} = -\frac{1}{d^2} \, dd \), which gives \( dd = -d^2 \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \).

Substituting \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = -\frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, so we take the absolute value. The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
