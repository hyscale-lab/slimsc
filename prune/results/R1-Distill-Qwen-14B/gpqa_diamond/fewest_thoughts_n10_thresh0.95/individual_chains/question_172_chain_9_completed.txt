Alright, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Okay, so the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, so the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula I remember is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, though, it's about the ratio of excitation between two stars. Let me think. For each star, the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms would depend on their respective temperatures.

So, for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star 2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = same g ratio times exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me clarify. The problem states that the excitation is twice, which I think refers to the ratio of the population in the excited state compared to another state. So, for each star, the ratio depends on their own T.

Let me define the ratio for each star. Let’s say for star_1, the ratio is r1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, r2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that r1 = 2 * r2. Because star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So,

(g/(g')) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g/(g')) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The g factors (statistical weights) would cancel out since they are the same for both stars. So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides to make it easier. Let me write it as:

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))).

Simplify the left and right sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Then, rearranging terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2).

Hmm, so this gives:

[1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

But wait, I think I can write this as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but I don't know the value of k and ΔE. Let me see, in the problem statement, the ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's interesting because Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So substituting, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is the same. Let's plug into [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

So [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE = ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * (1/1) ) = ln(2) / K.

Wait, but when you plug the numbers in, the (1.38e-23) cancels out, leaving ln(2)/ (1 K).

Wait, but the left side is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ] / (1.38e-23 J) ) 

The 1.38e-23 terms cancel, so it becomes ln(2) / K * K? Wait, let me compute step by step.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

[ (ln(2) ) * k ] / ΔE = [ ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ] / (1.38e-23 J) ) 

The 1.38e-23 and J terms cancel:

= ln(2) * (1/K) * (1) ) 

So it's ln(2) / K.

Wait, that can’t be right because the left side has units of 1/K (since (T1-T2) is in Kelvin, and T1 T2 is K^2, so (K^2) denominator makes it 1/K^2. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which is (1/T2 - 1/T1) as I had earlier. Let me think in terms of units.

Each 1/T is 1/K. So the left side is (1/K), right?

Wait, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

The left side is ( (T1-T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (1/K) terms.

On the right side, with k in J/K and ΔE in J, the units are (J/K * J) )? Wait, no, [k]/[ΔE] would be (J/(K)) / J = 1/K. So [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE has units 1/K.

So both sides have units of 1/K. So the equation is dimensionally consistent.

But I'm getting the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(ΔE).

But since ΔE is given as k (because k=1.38e-23 J/K and ΔE=1.38e-23 J), that would make (k)/(ΔE) = 1/(1) = 1 K^{-1}? Wait, no, let's compute the ratio.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = (1 J/K) ) / (1 J) ) * (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) )

Wait, J cancels, so it's 1/K.

So (k)/(ΔE) = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So the right side becomes ln(2) * (1/K).

So the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K? Wait, no, let me clarify.

Wait, the right side is [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE = ln(2) * [k/ΔE] = ln(2) * [ (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) ] = ln(2) * (1/K) / (1) ) = ln(2) / K.

Wait, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K.

But that would mean K is in Kelvin?

Wait, no, because the left side is in 1/K, and the right side is [ln(2) * (1/K) ].

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the units, but perhaps the main point is that the equation reduces to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Because when I plug the numbers in, k and ΔE are equal. Let me see:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So,

(k)/(ΔE) = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K * J / J = 1/K.

Wait, but then (k)/(ΔE) = 1/K, so when you multiply by ln(2), it's ln(2)/K.

Wait, but that would mean the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K). But the left side has units of 1/K, so the right side must have units 1/K as well. So ln(2) * (1/K) has units 1/K, which matches.

But this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the equation without units for now.

So, after simplifying, I have (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(ΔE).

But since k=ΔE, because both are 1.38e-23 J/K and J respectively, but wait, no, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J which equals k*T, where T is 1 K, because k=1.38e-23 J/K. So k*T for T=1 K is 1.38e-23 J. So in this case, ΔE = k*T where T=1 K.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. The problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k. So, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, [k/ΔE] = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So, the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K? No, wait, ln(2) * (1/K) would be unitless multiplied by 1/K, which is 1/K.

But the left side is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) which is 1/K.

So, the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2) ) * (1/K) ) * K? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the algebra. Let me write the equation again:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Now, substituting k = 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, so:

[ ln(2) * 1.38e-23 J/K ] / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) * (1.38e-23 / 1.38e-23 ) * (J/K / J) )

The J cancels, so it's ln(2) * (1/K) * (1/1).

So, the right side is ln(2)/K.

Wait, but then the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which has units of 1/K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/K.

Wait, but what is K here? Because K is the unit of temperature. So perhaps the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) )? That doesn't make sense, because K is a unit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express the equation without units for the sake of solving.

We have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(ΔE).

But k = 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, so k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/(K).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) ).

Wait, but the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), correct.

But how does this relate to K? Because the left side is a value in 1/K. The right side is ln(2) * (1/K) ) = ln(2)/(K).

So, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K.

Wait, but this would imply that the left side is equal to a term that has a unit of 1/K. But that's okay because the left side is 1/K.

Wait, but perhaps the real equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(ΔE).

And since k=ΔE, then (k)/(ΔE) = 1, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Yes! Because if ΔE = k, then (k)/(ΔE) = 1. So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, yes! So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is the same as the equation I derived.

So the correct equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{upper}} \) and \( n_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are their statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For the two stars, the excitation ratios are given as:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star, we write:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g}{g'} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g}{g'} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing these equations and canceling \( \frac{g}{g'} \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\Delta E / k \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this, we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because it does not account for the difference in temperatures.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it introduces an unnecessary sum in the numerator.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it includes a squared term in the denominator, which is not present in the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
