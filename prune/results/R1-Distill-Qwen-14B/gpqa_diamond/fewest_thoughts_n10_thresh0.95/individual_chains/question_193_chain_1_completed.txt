Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. And the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So, we're looking for the relationship between N and r.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related, right? Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So if r increases, plx decreases.

Given that N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx with 1/r, that would make N proportional to (1/( (1/r) ))^5. Wait, let me do that substitution correctly. Because plx is 1/r, so 1/(plx) would be r. So 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars is increasing with r^5. But that seems counterintuitive because if you go further away, you should see fewer stars, right? Or wait, no, maybe not. Because stars are more spread out, but the region is fixed, but perhaps the way they're counting is different.

Wait, but let's think about the exact relationship. If number N = k * (1/(plx)^5), and plx = 1/r, then N = k * (r^5). So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Oh wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's looking for the derivative of N with respect to r. Because per unit range would be the change in N as r changes by a small amount.

So N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5*r^4. So the number of stars added per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as an option. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Oh, option C is r^4. So if the change in N per unit r is proportional to r^4, then the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So as you go further away, the number of stars increases with r^5. But why? Because perhaps the way the stars are distributed. Wait, but normally, the number of stars you can see increases as you can see more volume, but that's more like r^3. Oh wait, but in this case, the number is varying as 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So it's not the same as volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is only about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. So it's about the derivative. So N is proportional to r^5, so dN/dr is 5 r^4. Therefore, the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, so the answer would be option C.

But wait, another approach: sometimes in astronomy, the number of stars you observe per unit area (like per square degree) is considered, which depends on the volume you can see, which is proportional to r^3. But in this question, the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So plx is inverse of r, so 1/(plx)^5 is r^5, so the number of stars N goes as r^5. But if it's the number per unit distance, then the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), where \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), we can substitute \( \text{plx} \) into the equation. This gives \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Among the given options:
- \( \sim r^3 \) (Option A) does not match the derived relationship.
- \( \sim r^5 \) (Option B) represents the total number of stars but not the change per unit distance.
- \( \sim r^4 \) (Option C) matches the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- \( \sim r^2 \) (Option D) is unrelated to the derived relationship.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), corresponding to Option C.

Answer: C
