Okay, so I have this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmosphere stuff, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, "excited in a specific energy level" probably refers to the excitation state. So the number of atoms in that higher energy level is greater in star_1. Right, that makes sense because higher temperatures would excite more atoms.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a specific value, but maybe I don't need it for the equation. The problem is about the effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I should use the Boltzmann distribution equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, n1 is the number of atoms in the lower energy level, and n2 is the upper. Wait, but the question says that star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So for star_1, n2_1 is twice as much as n2_2, I think. Wait no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So maybe the excitation level is higher, so n2 (upper level) is higher.

Wait, but the number ratio is n2/n1. So for star_1, n2_1/n1_1 would be higher than for star_2, where n2_2/n1_2 is lower. Wait, but the problem says the number in star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So for star_1, the number in the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's that the excitation is twice as much, so maybe (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2?

Alternatively, the excitation level is the ratio of the number in the excited state to the ground state. So if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, then (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

So let me write that. Let me denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 = n2_1 / n1_1, and R2 = n2_2 / n1_2. The question states R1 = 2 * R2.

From the Boltzmann equation, R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, no, because higher energy levels have lower populations. Wait, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the upper level to the lower level is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's assume that level 2 is the excited state and level 1 is the lower (ground) state. So n2 is the number in the excited state, n1 the number in the lower state.

Then, the ratio R = n2/(n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Because ΔE is E2-E1, so E2 = E1 + ΔE. So for a higher level, the exponent is negative, leading to a lower population.

But wait, star_1 has twice the excitation, so R1 = 2 * R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So substituting R1 = 2 R2:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln(exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) = ln( 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, wait, because ln(a * b) = ln a + ln b. So ln(2 exp(-x)) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-x)) = ln(2) -x.

So putting it all together:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - (ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because the equation is:

- (ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) = ln(2)

Which is the same as ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm. So:

[ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] * (ΔE / k) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I'm trying to find an equation involving T1 and T2. Let me see if I can rearrange it to that.

Let me write it as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but that introduces ΔE, which is given, but the question is about the correct equation form. The options don't involve any other constants, so perhaps the correct equation can be written without the ΔE and k.

Wait, but in the question, the energy difference is given, but perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps I can take the reciprocal of both sides or express T2 in terms of T1. Let me think again.

Starting from the equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm. So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But wait, I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can make the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without the ΔE.

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE in them, so perhaps I can factor that out. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, maybe I can write the equation as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But I don't know the values of k and ΔE, but perhaps the equation can be manipulated to have T1 and T2 in the numerator or denominator.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the stars. Since star_1 is hotter, its excitation would be higher, so T1 > T2.

So if star_1 has higher excitation, R1 is higher than R2, which would imply that T1 is higher than T2?

Wait, no. Because according to the Boltzmann equation, higher temperature leads to more excitation. Let me think: For a given energy level, higher T makes the exponent less negative, so R increases. So if R1 is twice R2, and R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), that implies that T1 is higher than T2 because exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. Wait, no, let's see:

If R1 = 2 R2,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Which would mean that the exponent for T1 is more negative than for T2.

Wait, because 2 is a multiplier. Let me think: For example, if T1 is higher than T2, then (ΔE/(k T1)) is smaller than (ΔE/(k T2)), so -ΔE/(k T1) is less negative than -ΔE/(k T2). So exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) is bigger than exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), because a less negative exponent is closer to zero.

Wait, but the equation says R1 = 2 R2. So if R1 is bigger, that implies that exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) is bigger than exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), which would make T1 lower than T2? That can't be, because higher temperatures would have higher excitation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. R is n2/n1, which is the ratio of excited to ground state. So higher R means more excitation. So if R1 = 2 R2, star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2.

So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

[ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Hmm, so this is the equation. Let's see which option matches this form.

Looking at the options, I'm looking for an equation where (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals something, perhaps involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let's try to rearrange the equation.

Let me write it as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Which can be written as:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Because (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But the question is about which equation is correct, and the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps I can write it in terms of T1 and T2 without those constants.

Hmm, but the options given are in terms of ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2. So maybe I can manipulate the equation to get ln(2) on one side.

Wait, perhaps I can express it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which is the same as the earlier form. Now, if I can express this as ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options have ln(2) on the left, and the right side is a function of T1 and T2. So let's see the options.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check.

Wait, from the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But without knowing the value of ΔE and k, we can't get rid of them. But the options involve only T1 and T2, so perhaps the equation is expressed in terms of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would require that (ΔE/(k)) equals 1.

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute ΔE/(k_B), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k_B) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So if ΔE/(k) = 1 K, then our equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is exactly option D.

Because option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (\( n_2 \)) to the ground state (\( n_1 \)) is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are \( R_1 = \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} \) and \( R_2 = \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} \), respectively. The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this simplifies the equation to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
