Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is at least h-bar over 2, right? Or something like that.

Wait, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is related to the inverse of the lifetime (since the lifetime is the uncertainty in time). Or wait, actually, the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured, so the uncertainty in time is the lifetime itself.

So for each state, ΔE is approximately ħ/(2Δt). Since the lifetimes are different for the two states, their energy uncertainties would be different.

Wait a second, but the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So I think the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if their energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. They would overlap in the energy spectrum.

So first, I need to calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

The lifetime of state 1 is τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2).

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Converting that to eV·s would be helpful since the options are in eV.

I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. Got it.

So for state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Let me compute that: 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for state 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 ≈ (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) = (6.582e-16) / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV. So about 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the lifetimes are different, so the energy uncertainties are different. But when considering the energy difference between E1 and E2, I think we need the energy difference to be larger than both of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps the sum of their uncertainties?

Hmm, no, I think the usual rule is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the energy difference has to be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, or perhaps the sum?

Wait, perhaps the combined uncertainty. Let me think. Suppose E1 is measured to be E1, but it's uncertain by ΔE1. Similarly, E2 is uncertain by ΔE2. So the difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1). For this difference to be clearly resolved, (E2 - E1) should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, which would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two intervals might overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or maybe the minimum of the two? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let's get back to the basics. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1.

In order for the two levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the combined uncertainty of both energies. Because if it's smaller, the two energy levels could be within each other's uncertainty, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no, actually, the uncertainty principle applies to each state individually. So for each state, their energy is within ±ΔE of their measured value. So the two states' energy intervals must not overlap. So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then there's no overlap between the two intervals, and they can be distinguished. If it's less, then the intervals might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So the condition is ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

We have ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So their sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be at least about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So no.

B)1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C)1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, that's enough.

D)1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7. So no.

Wait, wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, wait a second. Let me reevaluate the calculations more accurately.

First, compute ħ:

ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

State 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-9) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 eV = 3.291e-7 eV.

State 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 eV = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

Sum of the uncertainties is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.619e-7 eV.

The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this sum.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7. So it's sufficient.

Option A is 1e-9, which is 0.000000001 eV, much less than 3.6e-7. Not enough.

Option B is 1e-11, even worse.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 3.6e-7. So not enough.

So the only option that is larger is C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, that's way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, they can be distinguished.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2},
\]

where \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) are the lifetimes of the two states.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For state 1:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For state 2:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E \geq 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the requirement is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
