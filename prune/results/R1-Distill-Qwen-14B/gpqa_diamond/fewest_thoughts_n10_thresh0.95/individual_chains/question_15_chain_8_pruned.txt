Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital distance.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, right, shorter period means it's closer to its star because of Kepler's third law. The host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

Wait, what affects the transit probability? I think the probability P is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, no, I think that's not exactly right. Another formula I recall is the geometric probability, which depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Specifically, P = (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s)². Or wait, maybe it's (R_p/(R_s))² multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_s)))). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on. The edge-on probability is higher when the planet is closer because a is smaller, so maybe the transit probability is higher when a is smaller. So for a planet with a smaller orbital distance (like Planet_1), the transit probability is higher.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits in front of the star. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), right? Or perhaps the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/R_s)) times some factor. Alternatively, I think the formula is (R_p/(R_s))^2 * (R_s/a) * (something else?), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's get the exact formula right. The transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) ) * (1 / (1 + (R_s/a)) )). Or another source says the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (R_s + R_p) / a ] / [ (R_s + R_p) / a ] but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), but I might be mixing up terms.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the geometric probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) + 1)) ) or something like that. Oh wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / (a) * (R_p / R_s)^2). Hmm, no, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ). Wait, let me check. The transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) because the area where the planet can be in front is a circle of radius R_p around the star, so the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ), but only if a is much larger than R_s, which it usually is. So the formula simplifies to (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s/a) )= (R_p^2 * R_s ) / (R_s^2 a ) = R_p^2/(R_s a).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Another approach: the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough to cause a transit is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Because the orbital distance a is the distance from the star, and the star's radius R_s. So the probability is (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2, which would give (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (a^2 R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2. But that can't be right because then it would ignore the star's size. Hmm, maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, according to my notes, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) when a >> R_s. So P = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a). Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the factors that affect this probability.

The key factors are:

1. Planet's size relative to the star: a larger planet or smaller star increases the probability.
2. The orbital distance: a planet that is closer (smaller a) has a higher chance of transiting because the star appears smaller in the sky, making the alignment more likely.

So, given that, let's compute the probabilities for both planets.

First, let's note the given data:

- Both planets have the same mass, but mass doesn't directly affect transit probability, so we can ignore that.
- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = P2 / 3.

Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to (a^3)/(M_s), where M_s is the mass of the star. So, (P1^2)/(P2^2) = ( (a1^3)/(M1) ) / ( (a2^3)/(M2) ) ) = (a1^3 M2) / (a2^3 M1 )

Given that M1 = 2 M2 (because Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's), and P1 = P2 /3, so P1^2 = P2^2 /9.

So, ( (a1^3 * M2) ) / (a2^3 * M1) ) = ( (a1^3) * M2 ) / (a2^3 * 2 M2) ) = (a1^3) / (2 a2^3) ) = (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (1/9).

So,

(a1^3) / (2 a2^3) ) = 1 / 9.

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

a1^3 = (2 a2^3) * (1/9) ) = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) a2.

Compute the cube root of 2/9. Let's approximate 2/9 ≈ 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3 = 0.216). So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 is about 0.6 times the orbital distance of Planet_2.

Now, transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). But wait, do both planets have the same radius? The question doesn't say. Wait, the question only says both have the same masses, but radius isn't mentioned. Wait, but it's about Earth-like planets. So perhaps we can assume their radii are the same as Earth's. But in reality, mass and radius aren't directly proportional, but for Earth-like planets, perhaps we can treat R_p1 = R_p2.

So R_p1 = R_p2.

The stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, for transit probability:

P = (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 * R_s / (a R_s^2) ) = R_p^2 / (a R_s).

Wait, but since R_p and R_s are same for both, then P is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 / P2 = (a2 / a1) ) because P is inversely proportional to a.

Since a1 = 0.6 a2, then P1 = (a2 / (0.6 a2)) ) * P2 = (1/0.6) P2 ≈ 1.6667 P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, about 1.67 times higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: 2.7 times, which is higher than what we calculated.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me double-check. Let's think about the formula for transit probability again.

The correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R
