Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's lithium-6. So the nucleus is a ^6Li nucleus.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider relates to its kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Since it's a relativistic problem, I'll probably need to use the gamma factor.

The speed v is given as 0.96c. I should calculate gamma (γ) first because that's a key factor in relativistic energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass energy E_rest is m c². So I need the mass of ^6Li. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So for ^6Li, the mass is 6 u. Let me calculate that.

6 u = 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no. When dealing with atomic masses, the unit is in atomic mass units. But for energy, we usually convert that into electron volts (eV) or GeV. Oh right, because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So E_rest = m c² = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm that conversion. 1 u equals about 931.5 MeV/c², right? So yeah, 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So the rest energy is 5.589 GeV.

Now, the total energy E of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. So E = γ * E_rest = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.589.

Calculating 3.5 *5.589 is approximately 19.5615. But wait, 3.5714 is a bit more than 3.5, so let's do it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.589:

Let me break it down.

3 *5.589 =16.767

0.5 *5.589=2.7945

0.07 *5.589 ≈0.39123

0.0014 *5.589≈0.00782

Adding all together: 16.767 +2.7945=19.5615; +0.39123=19.95273; +0.00782=19.96055 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.96 GeV? But wait, wait a second. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, I can do it as 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.589.

Calculating:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857

3.5714 * 0.08=0.285712

3.5714 *0.009=0.0321426

Adding them up:

17.857 +1.7857 =19.6427

19.6427 +0.285712=19.928412

19.928412 +0.0321426 =19.9605546 GeV.

So approximately 19.96 GeV. But looking at the options, the choices are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the energy of the collider is so that the speed is 0.96c. Wait, but what energy is being referred to? Is it the kinetic energy (K) or the total energy (E)?

Because in particle physics, when you talk about the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, this is a point I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think the problem is asking for the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the total energy is E = γ m c², and the kinetic energy is K = (γ -1) m c².

So which one is the answer? Because the options don't seem to match either possibility.

Wait, let me think again. The RHIC's energy is specified in terms of the beam energy. Typically, the beam energy is the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's given as the total energy. I'm not 100% sure, but perhaps the question is asking for the total energy.

Wait, but the options are all in the 18-23 GeV range. My earlier calculation for total energy was about 19.96 GeV, which would round to approximately 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let's calculate that. 0.28² is 0.0784, because 28*28 =784, so yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Now, the rest mass energy is 6 u. Oh wait, wait a second. The molar mass of Li is about 7 g/mol, but wait, no, that's for the isotope. Wait, no, I think I got it right. ^6Li has a mass of 6 u.

Wait, but wait another thing: when using the mass in atomic mass units, the molar mass in grams is approximately the same as the mass number. So 6 grams per mole, but wait, no, that's the molar mass, which is grams per mole. But each mole is Avogadro's number of atoms. So the mass of one ^6Li nucleus is 6 u, which is about 6 * 1.66e-27 kg, but perhaps we don't need to calculate it in kg.

Wait, but I think the conversion I used earlier is correct. 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.589 GeV ≈19.96 GeV, as I computed earlier.

But the options don't have 19.96. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c, so beta (β) = v/c =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - β²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

Compute sqrt(0.0784): 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps using more precise value for sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0784 is 784 *1e-4. The square root of 784 is 28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

So perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, but 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So perhaps I was accurate enough.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass was calculated incorrectly. Let me double-check.

The rest mass energy m c² for ^6Li is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So that's correct.

So E = gamma * 5.589 GeV = 3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute this product accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.589.

Calculating step by step:

3 *5.589 =16.767

0.5*5.589=2.7945 → 16.767 +2.7945=19.5615

0.07142857 *5.589 → Hmm, 0.07 is 0.39123, and 0.00142857 is approximately 0.008003.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate 3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285

3.57142857 *0.08 = 0.2857142856

3.57142857 *0.009 =0.03214285713

Adding all together:

17.85714285 +1.785714285 =19.64285714

+0.2857142856 =19.92857142

+0.03214285713=19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I
