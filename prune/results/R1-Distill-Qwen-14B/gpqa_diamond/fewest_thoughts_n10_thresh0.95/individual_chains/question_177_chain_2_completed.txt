Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right? The question gives some details: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right! I remember that for main-sequence stars, there's a mass-luminosity relation, something like L ∝ M^3 or so. So if Star_1 is more massive, it should be intrinsically brighter.

But then the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's about the peak emission wavelength. I remember Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K) and T is the star's temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because the same λ_max implies the same T.

Wait, but if the stars have the same temperature, then their luminosities depend on their radii squared, since the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, so L is proportional to R² multiplied by T⁴. But since T is the same for both, the ratio of their luminosities would just be (R1² / R2²) multiplied by (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 equals T2, that factor is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

But wait, the problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, (R1/R2) = 1.5, so (R1/R2) squared is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have a 2.25 and a 2.32 and others. So if that's the case, then the luminosity ratio would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the problem introduces another factor. They mention radial velocities. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. How does that affect the luminosity? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Because radial velocity affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift, right? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the light gets blueshifted or redshifted. But wait, in this problem, the observed wavelength at which the star appears brightest is the same. So the emitted wavelength (from the star's own frame) would be different if there's a Doppler shift, but the observed wavelength is the same. 

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. That's the observed λ_max, right? Because if the star is moving, the emitted wavelength is different. So if both observed λ_max are the same, but the stars have different velocities, does that affect their actual temperatures?

Let me think. The observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is different. I think it's λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (if it's moving away, v is positive). Wait, no, I think that's the relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c), where v is the recession velocity (positive for moving away, negative for approaching). But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but their velocities are different, then their actual emitted wavelengths (and hence their temperatures) must be different. Because the observed λ_max is a combination of the emitted wavelength and the Doppler shift due to their velocities.

Wait, this complicates things. Because if both observed λ_max are the same, but Star_2 is moving away (velocity of 700 km/s), then Star_2's emitted wavelength must be longer than what we observe, right? Because if it's moving away, the light is redshifted. So when we observe the same λ_max for both, Star_1's emitted wavelength would be same as observed if it's not moving (v=0), but Star_2's emitted wavelength would be shorter because it's moving away. Wait, but the observed λ_max is same for both, so the emitted λ_max for Star_2 would be less than observed. Because when it's moving away, the emitted shorter λ would look longer to us.

Wait, let me get this right. For Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ_obs = λ_emit_1. For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s away. So the observed λ_obs would be λ_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive for moving away. Alternatively, using the approximation for non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs ≈ λ_emit_2 (1 + v/c).

But since both λ_obs are same, let's say λ_obs is the same for both. So λ_obs = λ_emit_1 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v/c) (approximate). So λ_emit_2 = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). Since v is 700 km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s, so v/c is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333, which is about 0.233%.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333, so λ_emit_2 ≈ λ_obs / 1.002333 ≈ approximately 0.9977 * λ_obs.

Therefore, the emitted wavelength for Star_2 is shorter than that of Star_1. Which means that Star_2's temperature is higher, because from Wien's law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So T2 = b / λ_emit_2, which is higher than T1 = b / λ_emit_1.

Wait, but that's a problem because earlier I thought that T was same because λ_obs was same, but that was under the assumption that the stars' velocities are zero. Now, because of the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different.

Hmm, this complicates things. So now, the actual temperatures of the stars are different, which affects the calculation of their luminosities.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. But the stars' actual λ_emit (emitted wavelengths) are different because of their velocities.

So for Star_1: v_r =0, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

For Star_2: v_r=700 km/s, so λ_emit2 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Or, in non-relativistic terms, λ_emit2 ≈ λ_obs (1 - v/c), but I'm not sure which approximation is better here.

Wait, let's think about it. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), when the source is moving away. So to find λ_emit, we can rearrange:

λ_emit = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Because in this case, Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive.

So plugging in v=700 km/s and c=3e5 km/s, which is 3e5 = 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) = sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) )

Calculating numerator and denominator:

0.9976667 ≈ 0.9976667

1.0023333 ≈ 1.0023333

Dividing these: 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ (approximate) 0.995367.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.995367) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So λ_emit2 ≈ λ_obs * 0.99768 ≈ 0.99768 * λ_obs.

So Star_2's emitted wavelength is about 0.99768 times the observed λ_max, which is the same as Star_1's emitted wavelength. So λ_emit2 is shorter than λ_emit1.

So T is inversely proportional to λ_emit. So T2 = (λ_emit1 / λ_emit2) * T1.

Because λ_emit1 = λ_obs, and λ_emit2 = 0.99768 * λ_obs. So λ_emit1 / λ_emit2 = 1 / 0.99768 ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * (1.00233) ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than Star_1.

But wait, the problem states that the stars' luminosities are to be computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So I need to find L1 and L2, considering their actual temperatures and radii.

So the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT^4. Therefore, L is proportional to R² T^4.

So let's write the ratio L1 / L2.

L1 = (R1²) * (T1)^4.

L2 = (R2²) * (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T2 is about 1.00233 T1.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00233 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Calculating 0.99768^4: Let's see, 0.99768 is approx 1 - 0.00232. So using the binomial approximation: (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx when x is small.

(0.99768)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.00232)^4 ≈ 1 - 4 * 0.00232 = 1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072.

But wait, more accurately, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Compute 0.99768^4:

First compute ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.002325.

Multiply by 4: ln^4 ≈ -0.0093.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.0093) ≈ 0.9908.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So putting it together, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.2284.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up here. Because (T1/T2) is 0.99768, so when raised to the 4th power, it's (0.99768)^4, which is about 0.9908. Then L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.228. So approximately 2.228 times.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.228 is approximately 2.23, which would be option D.

But wait, let's double-check the calculations because I'm a bit shaky on the exact numbers.

Wait, another approach: use exact numbers.

v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/300 = 0.00233333...

So the Doppler factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) = sqrt( (1-0.002333)/(1+0.002333) )

Compute numerator: 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

Denominator: 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

Ratio: 0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.995367.

Square root of 0.995367 is approximately 0.99768, as I did before.

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs * 0.99768.

Thus, λ_emit2 = 0.99768 λ_obs.

So T2 = (λ_obs / λ_emit2) * T1 = (1 / 0.99768) * T1 ≈ 1.00233 T1.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00233 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute 0.99768^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.99768^2 first.

0.99768 * 0.99768:

= (1 - 0.00232)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99536 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.99536538.

Now square that to get to the 4th power:

0.99536538^2 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.995365 * 0.995365.

Let me think of 0.995365 as approximately 0.995365 = 1 - 0.004635.

(1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a + a^2, where a =0.004635.

So 1 - 2*0.004635 + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.00002148 ≈ 0.99075.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute it more precisely using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can compute 0.995365 * 0.995365.

Let me do it step by step:

0.995365 * 0.995365.

Compute 995365 * 995365? No, that's too precise, but perhaps approximate it.

Approximating 0.995365 ≈ 0.995365.

Multiply 0.995365 * 0.995365:

= (0.995 + 0.000365)^2.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute (995365e-6)^2.

But maybe it's easier to compute 0.995365 * 0.995365 as:

= (0.995365)(0.995365) 

Let me compute 995365 * 995365:

But wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's think of 0.995365 as approximately 0.995365 ≈ 0.995365.

Multiplying 0.995365 by itself:

= (0.995365)^2 = ?

Let me compute it:

0.995365 * 0.995365:

Multiply 995365 * 995365:

But perhaps it's easier to compute 0.995365^2 = ?

= (995365 * 1e-6)^2 = (995365^2) * 1e-12.

But I don't have the exact value here. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator is better, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the approximation.

If 0.995365^2 is approximately 0.99075, as I thought earlier, then (0.99768)^4 is approximately 0.99075.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99075) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99075.

2.25 * 0.99075 = 2.25 * (1 - 0.00925) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.00925).

2.25 * 0.00925 = approximately 0.0208125.

So 2.25 - 0.0208125 ≈ 2.2291875.

So approx 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the initial assumption was that the temperatures are the same because λ_obs is the same. But that would have given 2.25, option A. But considering the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are slightly different, leading to a ratio of about 2.23.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity of a star is proportional to \( L \propto R^2 T^4 \). The problem provides the following key details:

1. **Radii**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Thus, \( \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).

2. **Temperatures**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has no radial velocity (\( v_1 = 0 \), \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)). Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]
   where \( v/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we calculate:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} \approx 0.99768
   \]
   Thus, \( \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \approx 0.99768 \lambda_{\text{obs}} \).

   From Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}} \approx 0.99768
   \]
   Raising this to the fourth power:
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.9908
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**: Combining the radius and temperature contributions:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.9908 \approx 2.229
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
