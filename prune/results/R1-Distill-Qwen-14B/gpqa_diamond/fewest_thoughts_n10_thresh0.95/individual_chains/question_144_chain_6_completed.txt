--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

The problem gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The question is about finding the mean decay distance. The options are all in units of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so I think this has to do with the mean lifetime and then the decay length based on the particle's velocity.

I remember that the mean lifetime (tau) of a particle is related to its width by the uncertainty principle. The formula is tau = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait! Γ is the decay width, which is the energy width. So I need to handle the units correctly.

Then, once I have the mean lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the particle to calculate the decay length. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * v * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, calculate the mean lifetime tau. The width Γ is 320 MeV. But I need to convert that into units compatible with ħ. I know that ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, but more importantly, ħc is a common unit in particle physics, but here I think I just need to convert Γ into GeV to match the units of ħ.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Now, ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm.

Next, I need the velocity. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV and mass m_X=1.2 GeV, I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy formula.

The energy E is gamma * m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c^2). But wait, in units where c=1 (as in particle physics, where energy and mass are in the same units), so E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666666..., so gamma is 20/3 or approximately 6.6667.

Then, beta (v/c) can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So let's solve for beta.

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²) → (1 - beta²) = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So beta squared is 1 - (3/(20))² → 1 - (9/400) = (400 - 9)/400 = 391/400 → beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/(gamma)^2: gamma is 8/1.2=20/3 ≈6.6667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 =0.0225.

So 1 - beta squared is 0.0225, so beta squared is 0.9775, beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c, meaning the particle is moving very close to the speed of light.

Now, the decay length L is gamma * v * tau. Wait, because L = v * tau * gamma.

Wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and v is in terms of c, so v = beta c.

So L = gamma * beta c * tau.

Wait, let me write that:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Yes, that makes sense. So I need to compute gamma * beta, then multiply by c and tau.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667. Beta is approximately 0.9887. So gamma * beta ≈6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.591.

So, gamma * beta ≈6.591.

Wait, let me compute that accurately: 6.666666... * 0.9887 = ?

Let me calculate 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6.6667 * 0.98 = 6.5334 (because 6.6667 *0.98 = 6.6667*(1-0.02)=6.6667-0.133334 ≈6.5333667)
Wait, no, wait, perhaps using a calculator method.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

0.9887 = 0.9 + 0.08 + 0.0087.

Wait, 6.6667 * 0.9 = 6.0 (approx 6.0, since 6.6667 *0.9=6.0).

6.6667 *0.08=0.533336.

6.6667 *0.0087 ≈0.058000.

So adding up: 6.0 + 0.533336 =6.533336; plus 0.058 →6.591336.

So approximately 6.5913.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5913.

Now, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So putting it all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

Compute 6.5913 * 3e8 = 6.5913 *3 =19.7739 → 19.7739e8 m/s.

Wait, no. Wait, 6.5913 multiplied by 3e8 (3 followed by 8 zeros) is 6.5913 * 3e8 = 19.7739e8 m/s.

Wait, no, correct: 6.5913 * 3e8 = (6.5913 *3) * 1e8 = 19.7739 * 1e8 m/s → 1.97739e9 m/s.

Wait, but tau is 2.056875e-24 s. So multiply that:

L=1.97739e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that:

Approximately 2 * 2.05 is about 4.1.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

Subtract 0.02261 *2.056875.

Wait, 2.056875 *0.02 is 0.0411375. 0.00261 *2.056875 ≈0.005374.

So 0.02261 *2.056875 ≈0.0411375 +0.005374 ≈0.0465115.

So 4.11375 - 0.0465115 ≈4.0672385.

So L ≈4.0672385e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to what I just got.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the product 1.97739 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875=4.11375.

But 1.97739 is 2-0.02261.

So (2 - 0.02261) * 2.056875 = 2*2.056875 - 0.02261*2.056875.

Which is 4.11375 - (0.02261 *2.056875).

Compute 0.02261 *2.056875:

0.02 *2.056875 = 0.0411375.

0.00261 *2.056875 = approx 0.005374.

So total is 0.0411375 +0.005374 =0.0465115.

So 4.11375 -0.0465115=4.0672385.

So 4.0672e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to approximation in gamma * beta.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Going back, gamma is exactly 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.666666667.

Beta squared is 1 - (m^2)/(E^2) )= 1 - (1.44)/(64) )=1 - 0.0225 =0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Wait, wait, sqrt(0.9775) is more accurately calculated.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that (0.9887)^2 = ?

Compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

(1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.0113) + (0.0113)^2 ≈1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 ≈0.97752769.

Which is approximately 0.977528, which is very close to 0.9775, so beta is approximately 0.9887.

So gamma * beta is (20/3) * 0.9887.

Compute 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

6.6666666667 * 0.9887 = let's compute this.

Compute 6 *0.9887 =5.9322.

0.6666666667 *0.9887 ≈ 0.6666666667 *0.9887.

Wait, 0.6666666667 is 2/3.

So (2/3)*0.9887 ≈ 0.6591333333.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591333333 =6.5913333333.

So gamma * beta = approximately 6.5913333333.

So now, let's recompute the product 6.5913333333 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Compute 6.5913333333 * 3e8 = 19.774e8 m/s = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) )e-15.

Compute 1.9774 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9774 * 2.056875:

We can write this as (2 - 0.0226) * 2.056875.

Which is 2*(2.056875) - 0.0226*(2.056875).

2*2.056875 =4.11375.

0.0226 *2.056875 = let's compute that.

0.02 *2.056875 = 0.0411375.

0.0026 *2.056875 = 0.005347875.

So total is 0.0411375 +0.005347875 =0.046485375.

So 4.11375 -0.046485375=4.067264625.

So 4.067264625e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, why am I getting 4.067e-15 and option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, seems very close, perhaps due to approximations in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, let me recheck that step.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

I used ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV).

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 = (6.582 *100) /32 = 658.2 /32 → 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 GeV·s / GeV → s.

So 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption about E and m is correct?

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So yes, gamma is 8/1.2=20/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of beta is more precise. Another approach is to calculate beta using more accurate methods.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) )= sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887 approximately.

But perhaps using a calculator, sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887085.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(a) around a=1.

But perhaps it's easier to compute:

Let me compute 0.9887^2=0.97752769.

Which is 0.97752769, which is close to 0.9775.

Wait, so beta is approximately 0.9887085.

Let me compute 0.9887085^2 = (0.9887085)*(0.9887085).

Let me compute:

0.98 *0.98 =0.9604.

0.98 *0.0087085 =0.008532.

0.0087085 *0.98=0.008532.

0.0087085 *0.0087085 ≈0.00007583.

So adding up:

0.9604 + 0.008532 + 0.008532 + 0.00007583 ≈0.9604 + 0.017064 +0.00007583 ≈0.97753983.

Which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.9887085.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.9887085.

20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.

So 6.666666667 *0.9887085.

Let me compute 6.666666667 *0.9887085.

So 6 *0.9887085=5.932251.

0.666666667 *0.9887085.

Compute 0.666666667 *0.9887085.

0.666666667 is 2/3.

(2/3)*0.9887085 = (0.9887085 *2)/3 =1.977417 /3 ≈0.659139.

So total is 5.932251 +0.659139=6.59139.

So gamma*beta=6.59139.

Now, compute 6.59139 *3e8 = 1.977417e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s:

1.977417e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977417 *2.056875) )e-15.

Compute 1.977417 *2.056875.

Again, 1.977417 is approximately 1.977417.

Let me compute this multiplication.

1.977417 *2.056875.

Perhaps it's easier to break it down:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

So 1.977417 *2 =3.954834.

1.977417 *0.05 =0.09887085.

1.977417 *0.006875 = ?

0.006875 is 1/144, approximately.

Compute 1.977417 *0.006875.

0.006875 = 6.875e-3.

1.977417 *6.875e-3 = (1.977417 *6) *1e-3 + (1.977417 *0.875e-3).

Wait, 1.977417 *6 =11.864502, so 11.864502e-3=0.011864502.

1.977417 *0.875 = let's compute 1.977417 * 0.875.

0.875 is 7/8.

1.977417 *7 =13.841919; divide by 8 →1.730239875.

So 1.730239875e-3=0.001730239875.

So adding them up: 0.011864502 +0.001730239875≈0.013594741.

So the total for 0.006875 part is 0.013594741.

Now, add all parts:

3.954834 (from 2) +0.09887085 (from 0.05) +0.013594741 (from 0.006875) = 3.954834 +0.09887085 =4.05370485 +0.013594741≈4.0673 m.

Wait, no, because the exponents are 1e-15. Wait, no, the calculation is 1.977417 *2.056875 =3.954834 +0.09887085 +0.013594741 =4.0673 m? Wait, no, that's not right, because 1.977417 *2.056875 is about 4.0673.

Wait, no, wait. 1.977417 *2.056875 is approximately 4.0673.

So 4.0673e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference is likely due to more precise intermediate steps or perhaps using a more accurate value for ħ.

Wait, another point: did I use the correct value for ħ? Sometimes ħ is approximated as 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but perhaps a more precise value is 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV s.

Wait, let me check ħ.

Yes, ħ= h/(2pi)= approximately 6.582 x10^-25 GeV·s.

So perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute tau more precisely.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582/0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

So now, perhaps the calculation of gamma * beta is the next point.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

gamma =8 GeV /1.2 GeV=20/3=6.666666666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2) )= sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64))= sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887085293...

So beta ≈0.9887085293.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) *0.9887085293= (20 *0.9887085293)/3.

Compute 20 *0.9887085293=19.774170586.

Divide by 3: 19.774170586 /3 =6.591390195.

So gamma * beta=6.591390195.

Then, c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.591390195 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 6.591390195 *3e8 =1.9774170585e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.9774170585e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774170585 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.9774170585 *2.056875.

Let me compute this precisely.

1.9774170585 × 2.056875.

Let me break it down:

=1.9774170585 * (2 + 0.05 + 0.006875)

=1.9774170585*2 + 1.9774170585*0.05 + 1.9774170585*0.006875.

Compute each term:

1.9774170585 *2 =3.954834117.

1.9774170585 *0.05 =0.098870852925.

1.9774170585 *0.006875.

Compute 0.006875 =1/144 ≈0.006875.

1.9774170585 *0.006875 = ?

Let me compute 1.9774170585 *0.006875.

= (1.9774170585 *6875 ) * 1e-6.

Wait, 6875 is 6.875e3, which is 6875.

So 1.9774170585 *6875.

Compute 1.9774170585 *6875.

Compute 2 *6875=13750.

Subtract 0.0225829415 *6875.

0.0225829415 ×6875 = let's compute:

0.02 ×6875=137.5.

0.0025829415 ×6875≈0.0025829415 ×7000=18.08 (approx), but more accurately:

6875 ×0.0025829415 = let me compute 6875 * 2.5829415e-3.

6875 *2.5829415e-3 = ?

6875 * 2.5829415e-3 = (6875 * 2)/1000 + (6875 * 0.5829415e-3).

= 13750/1000 + (6875 * 0.0005829415).

13750/1000=13.75.

6875 *0.0005829415 = ?

Approximately 6875 *0.000583 =6875 *5.83e-4.

Compute 6875 *5.83e-4 =6875 *5.83 /10000.

6875 *5.83 = let's compute.

Compute 6875 *5=34375.

6875 *0.83= let's compute.

6875 *0.8=5500; 6875 *0.03=206.25. So 5500+206.25=5706.25.

So total 34375 +5706.25=39, 34375 is 34 thousand, plus 5706 is 39,081.25?

Wait, wait, 34375 +5706.25=39, 34375 +5706.25 = 39,  (34375 is 34,375; 34,375 +5,706.25=40,081.25).

So 40,081.25 / 10,000=4.008125.

So approximately 4.008125.

So 13.75 +4.008125 ≈17.758125.

So 0.0225829415 ×6875 ≈17.7581.

So 1.9774170585 ×6875 ≈13750 -17.7581=13732.2419.

So 1.9774170585 ×0.006875 =13732.2419e-6=13.7322419e-3=0.0137322419.

So summing all three terms:

3.954834117 (from 2) 
+ 0.098870852925 (from 0.05)
+0.0137322419 (from 0.006875) 
= 3.954834117 +0.098870852925 =4.05370497 +0.0137322419=4.067437212.

So 4.067437212e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, close but not exactly matching.

But wait, perhaps the calculation is off due to more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps my approximation for beta is the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Let me try a different approach, using exact fractions.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV=20/3.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) )= sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988708529.

So gamma * beta= (20/3)*0.988708529.

Compute 20/3 *0.988708529 =6.666666667 *0.988708529.

Let me compute 6.666666667 *0.988708529.

= (6 + 0.666666667) *0.988708529.

=6 *0.988708529 + 0.666666667 *0.988708529.

6 *0.988708529 =5.932251174.

0.666666667 *0.988708529 = (2/3) *0.988708529.

(2/3)*0.988708529 = (0.988708529 *2)/3 =1.977417058 /3 =0.6591390193.

Adding them:5.932251174 +0.6591390193=6.591390193.

So gamma * beta=6.591390193.

Then, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.591390193 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

First, multiply 6.591390193 *3e8 =1.977417058e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.977417058e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.977417058 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.977417058 *2.056875.

Let me compute this exactly:

1.977417058 *2.056875.

Let me write 2.056875 as 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

Compute each part:

1.977417058 *2 =3.954834116.

1.977417058 *0.05 =0.0988708529.

1.977417058 *0.006875=0.0137322419.

Adding them:3.954834116 +0.0988708529=4.053704969 +0.0137322419=4.067437211.

So 4.067437211e-15 meters.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, I'm getting 4.0674e-15 m, which is larger than option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

m^2=1.44, E^2=64.

So 1.44/64=0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887085293.

But perhaps using a calculator, sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887085.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it with more precision.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) with more precision.

Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to find sqrt(0.9775).

We need to find x where x^2=0.9775.

We'll start with an initial guess x0=0.9887.

Compute x0=0.9887.

x0^2=0.97752769.

The target is 0.9775, so the error is 0.97752769 -0.9775=0.00002769.

Next iteration: x1 = x0 - (x0^2 - target)/(2x0).

= 0.9887 - (0.00002769)/(2*0.9887).

= 0.9887 - 0.00002769/(1.9774) ≈ 0.9887 - 0.000014005.

= 0.988685995.

Check x1^2:

(0.988685995)^2 ≈ (0.9887)^2 - 2*(0.9887)* (0.000014005) + (0.000014005)^2.

≈0.97752769 - 2*0.9887 *0.000014005 + negligible.

≈0.97752769 - 0.00002767.

= 0.97750002.

Which is very close to 0.9775.

So x1=0.988686.

Thus, beta=0.988686.

So gamma * beta=6.666666667 *0.988686=?

Compute:

6 *0.988686=5.932116.

0.666666667 *0.988686= (2/3)*0.988686= (0.988686 *2)/3=1.977372/3=0.659124.

So total gamma * beta=5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

So gamma * beta=6.59124.

Then L=6.59124 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.59124*3e8=1.977372e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.977372e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.977372 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.977372 *2.056875.

Breakdown:

2.056875=2 +0.05 +0.006875.

So:

1.977372*2=3.954744.

1.977372*0.05=0.0988686.

1.977372 *0.006875=0.01372485.

Adding up:

3.954744 +0.0988686=4.0536126 +0.01372485=4.06733745.

So approximately 4.06733745e-15 m.

This brings me back to the same figure, which is about 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The discrepancy is likely due to rounding in intermediate steps or using more precise values for constants.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the following steps:

1. **Mean Lifetime Calculation**:  
   The mean lifetime $\tau$ is related to the decay width $\Gamma$ by the formula:  
   $$\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.$$  
   Here, $\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}$ and $\Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV}$. Substituting these values:  
   $$\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.$  

2. **Relativistic Energy and Velocity**:  
   The energy $E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV}$ and mass $m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}$ are related by the relativistic energy formula:  
   $$\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.$$  
   The velocity $v$ is determined from the relation:  
   $$\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.$$  
   Thus, $\beta \approx 0.9887$, and the Lorentz factor $\gamma \approx 6.6667$.  

3. **Decay Length Calculation**:  
   The decay length $L$ is given by:  
   $$L = \gamma \beta c \tau,$$  
   where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Substituting the values:  
   $$L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.$$  
   First, calculate $\gamma \beta$:  
   $$\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.$$  
   Then, calculate $c \tau$:  
   $$c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.$$  
   Finally, multiply by $\gamma \beta$:  
   $$L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.$$  

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated decay length is approximately $4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$. Among the given options, the closest value is **$4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$**, which corresponds to **Option B**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
