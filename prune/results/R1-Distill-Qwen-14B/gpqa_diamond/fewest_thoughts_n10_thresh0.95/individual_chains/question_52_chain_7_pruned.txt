Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack everything.

Alright, the question is about a star's effective temperature and how it affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of elements depend a lot on the temperature. Oh, and the problem mentions LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can use standard formulas for emission in that scenario.

So, the star's parameters: when there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the radius is 1.5 solar radii with 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. Wait, but how is the effective temperature determined when part of the surface is cooler? Oh, right, the spots are cooler, so the total luminosity is less. Because the effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity and radius.

Wait, but the problem says when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the star's total luminosity decreases. But maybe that's extra info, and the key here is about the photospheric conditions for the Ti atoms.

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, wait. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there's no spots (case 1), the ratio is R1. When there are spots (case 2), the ratio is R2. The factor is R1/R2. Or is it R2/R1? The question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R2 < R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1. So the factor is how much bigger R1 is compared to R2.

Hmm, right. So, I think we need to model the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of energy levels change with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2, is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but sometimes I see it written as n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, correct, so if E2 > E1, then higher energy level. So, if temperature decreases, the exponential term changes. Because if T goes down, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 (assuming E2>E1) would decrease. So, lower T would mean less population in higher levels.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). Wait, but wait, are the spots affecting the entire photosphere, or just parts of it? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is the same as before. Hmm, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Wait, maybe the photosphere as a whole is being considered, but perhaps the presence of spots changes the average temperature. Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the temperature of the photosphere changes when the spots are present. Wait, the question states: "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So, perhaps the photosphere's average T_eff is lower.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are cooler regions, so the average T_eff is lower because the star's total luminosity is the sum of the spotted and unspotted areas. The effective temperature is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR^2 σ Teff^4. So, if the star's surface is partially covered with cooler spots, the overall L would be less, leading to a lower Teff.

But for the purpose of this problem, we can model it as the photosphere having a lower effective temperature when spots are present. So the question is about the effect of temperature on the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels.

So, the observed ratio decreases when spots are present, meaning that when T_eff is lower (5500 K), the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) is lower. Because the ratio of lower level to upper level.

Wait, let me think. Let's say the two levels are level 1 (lower energy) and level 2 (higher energy). The ratio of n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes smaller (since T is in denominator). So, for E2 > E1, (E2-E1) is positive. So, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller as T decreases. So the exponential term is smaller. So, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is for the population ratio. Let me get the equation correctly. The ratio of the number of atoms in two states is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So, if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So, lower T makes the exponent more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the number in the higher state is lower compared to the lower state when T is lower.

So, the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait. Let's clarify. Let me denote:

n1 = number of atoms in level 1,

n2 = number in level 2.

The Boltzmann factor is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, solving for n1/n2 gives:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Hmm, so if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, because denominator is smaller. So, the exponential term increases, so n1/n2 increases.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger because T is smaller. So, (E2-E1) is positive, so exponent becomes positive and larger. So, exp( a larger positive number) is larger, so n1/n2 (which is the ratio) increases.

So, when the temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases. Because lower energy levels are more populated relative to higher ones.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), ratio is lower. Wait that conflicts with our previous conclusion. So there must be something wrong here.

Wait, maybe the two levels are such that level 1 is higher than level 2. No, because the transition is between two levels, but the way the ratio is defined in the problem is n1/n2. So perhaps I should think about it in terms of the energy levels.

Wait, wait, the transition is at 1448 Å. That's in the UV range, I think. So, which energy levels are these? Well, regardless, the key is the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, perhaps the energy level difference is such that level 2 is higher than level 1. So, when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 (which is what the problem is looking at) would increase. Because lower T makes the exponential term bigger.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that suggests that when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which would mean that the ratio is actually n2/n1 that is being considered.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So during spots, R = n1/n2 is lower. That would happen if when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

But from the equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. As T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases. So n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when T is lower. So that would imply that E2 < E1, which would mean that the ratio is inverted.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Maybe the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1. Let me re-read the question.

The question states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", but doesn't specify which is in the numerator. Wait, the actual wording is: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So perhaps they just define the ratio as N1/N2, without specifying which is higher. But the way the problem is set up, when T decreases, this ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower.

From the equation, if E2 > E1, then N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which increases as T decreases. So that would mean that when T decreases, N1/N2 increases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, perhaps I got the levels inverted. Maybe level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. So E1 > E2. Then, (E2 - E1) is negative, so (E2 - E1)/(k T) is negative. Then, as T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so the exponent is smaller (more negative), so the exponential term is smaller. So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would decrease as T decreases.

Ah, that makes sense. So, if level 2 is lower in energy than level 1 (E2 < E1), then when T decreases, the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases because the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the exponential term is smaller. That would align with the problem's observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots (lower T).

So, to model this, let's define the energy difference. Let’s denote ΔE = E2 - E1. But in this scenario, since E2 < E1, ΔE is negative. Let’s write that ΔE = -|ΔE|.

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - |ΔE|/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term becomes smaller, hence N1/N2 decreases.

This matches the problem's observation. So, the ratio N1/N2 is g1/g2 multiplied by exp(-|ΔE|/(k T)).

Now, the problem is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, factor F = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp(-|ΔE|/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-|ΔE|/(k T2)) ].

Since g1/g2 is a constant (same in both cases), it cancels out. So,

F = exp( [ - |ΔE|/(k T1) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ] ) = exp( |ΔE|/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] )

Wait, let me compute that exponent carefully. Because:

exp( ( - |ΔE|/(k T1) ) ) / exp( ( - |ΔE|/(k T2) ) ) = exp( [ (- |ΔE|/(k T1)) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ) ] )

Which is exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, that's correct.

So, F = exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But wait, T1 is the temperature when there are no spots, which is 6000 K. T2 is when there are spots, 5500 K.

So,

F = exp( |ΔE|/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Now, I need to find |ΔE|, which is the energy difference between the two levels. But how?

The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So, the photon emitted or absorbed during this transition has a wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-6 meters.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. So,

E_photon = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-6 m) 

Let me compute that.

First, compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-6 m.

So, E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ 1.373e-19 J per photon.

But since this is the energy difference between the two levels, |ΔE| = E_photon = hc/λ.

So,

|ΔE| = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 / (1.448e-6) = let's compute:

Compute 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-6 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ 1.373e-19 J.

But wait, I need to compute |ΔE| in terms of eV per atom, perhaps, because when using Boltzmann factors, sometimes it's easier to work in eV and Boltzmann's constant is known in those units.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute |ΔE| in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, let's compute |ΔE| in Joules, and then compute |ΔE|/(k*T), etc.

But let's see: Boltzmann's constant, k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, let's compute the exponent:

( |ΔE| )/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me compute |ΔE| first.

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-6 m.

E_photon = hc/λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, from 2019 redefinition of kg)

c = 299792458 m/s.

So,

E_photon = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (1.448e-6) 

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

Let me compute 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8

= 6.62607015 * 2.99792458e-34+8

= 6.62607015 * 2.99792458e-26

Compute 6.62607 * 3 ≈ 19.878, but let's compute accurately:

6.62607 * 2.99792458 = ?

Well, 6*2.99792458 ≈ 17.9875475

0.62607 * 2.99792458 ≈ approx 1.877.

So total ≈ 17.9875 + 1.877 ≈ 19.8645. So approximately 19.8645e-26 J·m.

Wait, no: 6.62607 * 2.99792458 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it precisely:

2.99792458 * 6 = 17.9875475

2.99792458 * 0.62607:

Let me compute 0.6 * 2.99792458 = 1.79875475

0.02607 * 2.99792458 ≈ 0.078205.

So total 1.79875475 + 0.078205 ≈ 1.876959.

So 6.62607 * 2.99792458 ≈ 17.9875475 + 1.876959 ≈ 19.8645065.

So,

E_photon = (19.8645e-26 J·m) / (1.448e-6 m) 

= 19.8645e-26 / 1.448e-6 = 19.8645 / 1.448 * 1e-20 ≈ 13.72 * 1e-20 ≈ 1.372e-19 J.

So, |ΔE| ≈ 1.372e-19 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, |ΔE|/(k) = (1.372e-19) / (1.380649e-23) ≈ (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e4 ≈ approx 0.994 * 1e4 ≈ 9940 ≈ 9.94e3.

So, |ΔE|/(k) ≈ 9940 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

1/5500 ≈ 1.81818e-4.

1/6000 ≈ 1.66667e-4.

Difference: 1.81818e-4 - 1.66667e-4 = 0.15151e-4 = 1.5151e-5.

So,

Exponent becomes:

( |ΔE|/(k) ) * (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = 9940 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 

Compute 9940 * 1.5151e-5 = 9940 * 0.000015151.

Hmm, 9940 * 1.5151e-5 = 9940 * 1.5151 * 1e-5.

Compute 9940 * 1.5151 ≈ (approx 10000 * 1.5151) - (60 * 1.5151) = 15151 - 90.906 = approx 15060.094.

So, 15060.094 * 1e-5 = 0.1506.

So, exponent ≈ 0.1506.

So, F = exp(0.1506) ≈ e^0.1506.

Compute e^0.15: about 1.1618.

e^0.1506 ≈ 1.162.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me compute 0.1506.

The Taylor series of e^x is 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

x = 0.1506.

x^2 = (0.1506)^2 ≈ 0.02268.

x^3 ≈ 0.1506 * 0.02268 ≈ 0.003423.

x^4 ≈ 0.1506 * 0.003423 ≈ 0.000515.

So,

e^0.1506 ≈ 1 + 0.1506 + 0.02268/2 + 0.003423/6 + 0.000515/24

≈ 1 + 0.1506 + 0.01134 + 0.0005705 + 0.00002146

Adding up:

1 + 0.1506 = 1.1506

+0.01134 = 1.16194

+0.0005705 = 1.16251

+0.00002146 ≈ 1.16253.

So, approx 1.1625.

So, F ≈ 1.1625.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~1.1, option D is ~2.9, etc.

Hmm, but wait, this calculation gives approximately 1.16. But looking at the options, A is ~1.1, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the exponent.

Wait, the exponent was |ΔE|/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, no, perhaps I have the terms reversed. Because F = (N1/N2)_no / (N1/N2)_with = [exp( - |ΔE|/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( - |ΔE|/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( ( - |ΔE|/(k T1 ) + |ΔE|/(k T2) ) )

Which is exp( |ΔE|/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I used (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = 1.5151e-5.

Wait, that's correct. So, the exponent is positive, so F is greater than 1.

So, F is about 1.16, which is approximately 1.1. So, option A is ~1.1.

But wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating |ΔE|/(k). Let me recheck that.

|ΔE| was calculated as 1.372e-19 J.

k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

|ΔE|/k = (1.372e-19) / (1.380649e-23) = (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e4 ≈ 0.994 * 1e4 = 9940 K.

So that part was correct.

Then, (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000 )

= 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 1 / 66,000 ≈ 1.5151e-5.

So, the product is 9940 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 0.1506.

So, e^0.1506 ≈ 1.162.

So, the factor is approximately 1.16. So, the options have A as ~1.1.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy. Let's go back.

Wait, the wavelength given is 1448 Å. Which is 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m? Wait, no, wait: 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when converting Å to meters.

Wait, no, wait. 1 Å is 1e-10 m, right?

So, 1448 Å = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 meters.

Wait, earlier I used 1.448e-6 meters, which is 1448e-6 m = 1448 micrometers, which is incorrect. Because 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

Ah, that's a big mistake! So, I think I messed up the exponent there.

So, let's correct that.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
