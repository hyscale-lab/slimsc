Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I'll need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator.

First, I remember that eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A - λI) = 0. For a 2x2 matrix, this is straightforward. The matrix Ay is c times S, so let's write that out first.

The matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So when we multiply by c, Ay becomes:
[ 0    -i*c ]
[ i*c   0  ]

Wait, c is h/(4π). So substituting that in, the first row is 0 and -i*(h/(4π)), and the second row is i*(h/(4π)) and 0.

To find the eigenvalues (a), I'll set up the characteristic equation. So:

|Ay - a I| = 0

Which is:

[ -a      (-i c) ]
[ (i c)   -a    ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c).

Wait, let me compute that. (i c)(-i c) is (-i² c²) = (- (-1))c² = c². So the determinant is a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are +c and -c. Because c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but let me think. The question says that the eigenvalue equation is Ay(φ) = a φ. So a is either c or -c. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because c is real (h is Planck's constant, which is a real number, 4π is real, so c is real).

So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So any option talking about imaginary parts in the eigenvalues must be wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues are purely real, so the imaginary parts should be zero. So A is incorrect because it suggests the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B: Similarly, eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1, but with some real and imaginary parts. But our eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Wait, no, option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. So that would imply the eigenvalues are complex numbers, but our eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az (the Z-component). Hmm. Let's think. The operator A is the total angular momentum. So for a system with spin-½ (like a muon), the components of angular momentum commute with each other. Wait, but the square of the total angular momentum commutes with each component. So, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². But whether it's an eigenstate of Az is another question. Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A? Wait, I'm not sure about the exact commutation relations. Wait, angular momentum components satisfy [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz. Similarly, for these operators. So since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are different. So a state that's an eigenfunction of Ay can't be an eigenfunction of Az, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only happens if all the eigenvalues are zero, which isn't the case here. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct because A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which commutes with each component, including Ay and Az. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it must also be an eigenstate of A². But for Az, since it doesn't commute with Ay, a state can't be simultaneously an eigenstate of both. So option C is correct in that statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, which acts on a two-dimensional space, any eigenfunctions will form a basis if they are linearly independent. So if the eigenvalues are distinct, which they are (h/(4π) and -h/(4π)), then the eigenvectors are orthogonal and form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct in that the eigenfunctions form a basis. So what's the right answer?

Wait, let's go back to the question. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors are the basis. Alternatively, looking at the options, let's check each.

Wait, but let's think again. The statement in option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, the basis functions for the operator would probably refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which is the eigenbasis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was correct. Let me re-examine C. The statement is: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, since A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which is (Ay^2 + Az^2 + ...? Wait, no, for spin-½ particles, the total angular momentum squared is S² = Sx² + Sy² + Sz². So when you have a state that's an eigenstate of Sy (Ay in this case), does it also have to be an eigenstate of S²? Yes, because Sy and S² commute. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Sy (Ay) are also eigenfunctions of S² (A²). But for Sz (Az), they don't commute, so the same eigenfunctions won't be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Wait, but in our problem, Ay is c·S, and S is a spin-½ operator. So S² would be (3ħ²/4) (since for spin ½, S² = s(s+1)ħ², and s=½, so 3/4 ħ²). So the operator A would have eigenvalues a = ±c, and A² would have eigenvalue (c^2 + ... wait no, Ay is c·S, so A² would be (c·S)^2. Wait, but A is c times S. So when you square it, (c S)^2 = c² S². So the eigenvalues of A² would be c² times the eigenvalues of S², which for each state is (3/4)ħ².

Wait, but in any case, the point is that the eigenfunctions of Ay (an component) are eigenfunctions of the square of the total angular momentum. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the given matrix is S, which I think represents the Pauli matrices. Because the given matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which looks like i times the Pauli Y matrix. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So the matrix S is i times the Pauli Y matrix. Alternatively, perhaps S is the Pauli Y matrix. Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the given S is σy. So then, Ay = c·S = c σy. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1) = ±c. Since c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So in this case, the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis if they are distinct (which they are, since eigenvalues are ±c). So D is correct.

But let's think about option C again. The statement says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, they can have the same eigenfunctions. So a state that's an eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². However, Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So option C is correct.

So now, which options are correct? The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Let me check the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator is 2x2, and any two eigenvectors that are orthogonal and non-parallel will form a basis. So D is correct because the eigenfunctions (which are the eigenvectors) form a basis for the space. So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the question is a multiple-choice, and only one option is correct.

Let me reevaluate the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, any two orthogonal eigenvectors will form the basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it's operating on a two-dimensional space. Therefore, the eigenvectors (which are two, with eigenvalues c and -c) will form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

But then, what about option C? Let's think about whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A².

Since A is the total angular momentum operator, A² commutes with each component. So yes, any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A². So the statement in C is correct.

So now, two options seem correct, but perhaps only one is correct in the context of the question.

Wait, the question says: "the statement below will you consider to be correct?" So perhaps more than one statement is correct, but we need to see which one is correct.

Let me look again at each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so yes, their eigenfunctions are shared. But Az does not commute with Ay, so the same eigenfunctions won't be eigenfunctions of Az. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, and each eigenfunction is a vector (e.g., a 2-component vector), the set of eigenfunctions forms a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But I need to check the options again.

Looking back, the options given are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). → Incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary parts ±0.5, real parts ±1. → Also incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. → Correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay. → Correct.

So both C and D are correct statements?

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, in the matrix, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c·S has eigenvalues ±c. So the eigenvalues are real. So the options that have real eigenvalues are correct.

So between C and D, which is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement will you consider correct during the calculation.

Let me think about the calculation steps.

When calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting that the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B are out.

Now, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Also, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². So C is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So if the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps both C and D are correct. But in the context of the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors, being two in number and linearly independent, form a basis. So D is correct.

So, given that, which option is correct. The options are:

A) Wrong.

B) Wrong.

C) Correct.

D) Correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps one of the options is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix is 2x2 and the eigenvectors form a basis, but the statement says "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator." Well, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in the sense that they form a basis for the space on which the operator acts. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the physics.

The operator Ay is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvectors of the Pauli Y matrix are |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of the Y-component of spin. The eigenfunctions are these states, which are part of the basis for the two-dimensional space. So D is correct.

So which of the options is correct?

The options are:

C) The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct, but perhaps only one is an option. Let me read the options again.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Correct.

Wait, this is a problem because it's a multiple-choice question, so perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, another thought: For the operator Ay, the eigenvectors are the basis functions, but the question says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Wait, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of that matrix, meaning that in that basis, the matrix is diagonal. So D is correct.

So, I think both C and D are correct. But looking back, the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me see if the problem allows multiple correct statements, but it's a multiple-choice, which usually has only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the actual matrix for Ay.

Wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate the eigenvalues.

The matrix Ay is c multiplied by S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So c is h/(4π).

So Ay = c * S = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a      -i c ]

[ i c     -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Because (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i^2)(-1) c². Wait, wait:

Let me compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c².

i times i is i² = -1. So (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (1) c² * c²? Wait, no. Wait, it's (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) * c * c = ( (-i)(i) ) c².

(-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i)(i) is 1. So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are +c and -c, which are real. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out.

So which of the remaining options is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions coincide. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So maybe both C and D are correct, but only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator, which is 2x2, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the statement is about the relationship between the operators.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Let me think again: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so yes. So statement C is correct.

But wait, perhaps D is also correct. How to decide.

The question is about which statement is considered correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you would find that the eigenvalues are ±c, which are real. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a more general statement about the operators, not just the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Because the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but all eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are part of the basis. So D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, I would find that the eigenvalues are real (so A and B are out). Then, when considering the eigenvectors, I would find that they form a basis (so D is correct). Also, I would realize that these eigenvectors are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az (so C is correct).

But the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is a bit of a trick.

Wait, another thought: the matrix is 2×2, so any two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) will form a basis. So D is correct.

Thus, both C and D are correct statements. But since only one option can be correct, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which are basis vectors, but perhaps the statement in D is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So the correct answer is probably C or D.

Wait, another approach: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². But for a spin-½ particle, the square of the angular momentum operator A² is (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). Wait, but the operator here is Ay, which is the y-component. So each eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

But why is option D correct? Because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space.

But since the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, in the problem statement, the matrix is given, and the question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So the correct answer is option C because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I'll have to make a choice.

I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \( [0, -i] \) and the second row \( [i, 0] \). The matrix \( S \) resembles the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), leading to eigenvalues \( a = \pm c \), which are real. This eliminates options \( A \) and \( B \), as they suggest complex eigenvalues.

For option \( C \), the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes \( C \) correct.

For option \( D \), the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of the matrix operator, which form a basis for the 2-dimensional space since the eigenvalues are distinct (\( \pm c \)). Thus, \( D \) is also correct.

However, the question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation," and \( C \) provides a more insightful physical interpretation of the relationship between \( A_y \) and other angular momentum operators, while \( D \) is a general mathematical property. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is \( C \).

Answer: C
