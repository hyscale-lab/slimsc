--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's about starspots and exoplanets. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes, which can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that causes the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, no. The wording says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)" So the scenario is if the star had a planet instead of spots, what planet radius would mimic the brightness dip caused by the spots.

Hmm. So the main idea is to compare the change in brightness (the dip) caused by the planet blocking part of the star's light (a transit) with the change caused by the spots creating a brightness variation because of their lower temperature.

Wait, but starspots are dark regions, so when they're facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. But when the star rotates and the spots move away, the brightness increases. So the periodic variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. But in the case of a planet, the dip is when the planet transits in front of the star, blocking some light.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation of the star with spots can resemble an exoplanet. So when spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the star's brightness decreases. But for a planet, the brightness dip is when the planet is in front.

So to find the equivalent planet radius that causes the same dip in brightness as the spot-induced variation.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So if the star had an exoplanet instead of spots, what planet size would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

But wait, the spots cause a brightness variation that goes up and down as the spots rotate into and out of view. But a planet would cause a dip when it transits, but the rest of the time, the brightness is normal. So the amplitude of the dip is the key.

So the approach is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by the planet transiting, and solve for the planet radius.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the spots. The spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. The variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible (all spots facing us), and the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, the problem says that the star is observed in photometric time-series, so the brightness varies as the spots rotate. So the amplitude of this variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Alternatively, the star's brightness when the spots are facing us is lower than when they're on the other side. So the maximum brightness dip is when the spots are fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when the spots are hidden.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for the spots. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So for one hemisphere (which is half the star's surface), 20% of that is covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) )? Or wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the stellar disk covered by spots. If the hemisphere is half the disk, then the total spot area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) = 0.1 π R^2.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is (π R^2)/2. So spots' area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) )= 0.1 π R^2.

But wait, another thought: when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and then the other side comes into view. So the maximum change in brightness would be the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are visible and when they're not.

The star's total brightness is proportional to its surface area multiplied by the temperature^4 (since luminosity is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4). But when spots are present, the observed brightness is L_obs = L - L_spots + L_spot.

Wait, no. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the surface, they contribute less light. So the observed flux is (L - L_spots) + L_spot?

Wait, no. The star's luminosity without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ T_eff^4.

When spots are present, the total luminosity is L = (1 - f) * L + (f) * L_spot, where f is the filling factor. Because the f fraction of the surface is spots, which are cooler.

So L_spot is the luminosity of each spot. Each spot has a temperature T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000K.

So each spot's area is A_spot = (R_spot)^2 π? Wait, but the problem states that the star's radius is the same as the Sun. So the radius R is the same as the Sun, R_sun. So the spots are regions on the surface of R = R_sun.

Wait, but the spots have a radius—wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the size of the spots. It only gives the filling factor (20% of the hemisphere's area). So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 π R^2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the brightness variation when the spots are present. The maximum dip in brightness occurs when maximum area of spots is visible. Since the star is rotating, the spots would be on the near side or far side. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see the maximum effect.

So the change in flux (ΔF) when the spots are visible is the difference between the normal flux (F) and the flux when the spots are visible (F_spots).

The normal flux is F = σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are present, the flux from the star is F = F_un spotted area + F_spots.

The unspotted area is (1 - f) of the hemisphere, but wait, no: the entire star's surface is not spotted. Only one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2), because a hemisphere is half the surface area. So the total area with spots is 0.1 π R^2.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = (L_unspotted / L_total) * F + (L_spots / L_total) * F_spot.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change.

The total luminosity of the star without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are present, the total luminosity is L = L - f * (L / A_total) * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * A_spots,

Wait, perhaps another approach. The fractional change in brightness (ΔF / F) when the spots are present is equal to the average brightness when spots are visible compared to when they're not.

So when the spots are visible, the star's brightness is lower because the spots are cooler.

The fractional change (delta F) is [ (F_total - F_spots) / F_total ].

Wait, F_total is the flux from the entire star without spots.

F_spots is the flux from the spotted area when the spots are visible.

Hmm, perhaps think in terms of the area. The spotted area is 0.2 of the hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the entire star (since hemisphere is half). So the fractional area covered by spots is 0.1 when the spot hemisphere is facing us.

So the fractional change in flux (delta F / F) would be (F_spots - F_unspotted) / F_total.

Wait, F_unspotted is the flux without any spots. So when spots are present, the flux is F_total - (F_unspotted_area - F_spots_area).

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach: the fractional change in brightness is the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in their flux compared to the rest of the star.

So the fractional change is:

ΔF/F = (Fraction of spotted area) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / T_eff^4 )

Wait, that might be a good approach. Because each spot contributes less flux, so the total flux is reduced by the area of the spots multiplied by the factor (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

So the change in flux is (f * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ) / T_eff^4.

Wait, but f is the fractional area of the spots. So f = 0.1 because 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the entire star.

So ΔF/F = 0.1 * ( (5000^4 - 6000^4) ) / (6000^4 )

Wait, let's compute this. Let me calculate each term.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4. Let's compute that: (5/6) is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about... let me compute 0.8333^2 = ~0.6944. Then squared again: 0.6944^2 = ~0.4823.

So (5000^4 /6000^4) is approximately 0.4823.

So T_spot^4 = 0.4823 * T_eff^4.

So (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) = T_eff^4 (0.4823 - 1 ) = -0.5177 T_eff^4.

So ΔF/F is 0.1 * (-0.5177) = -0.05177. So about a 5.177% decrease in brightness.

Wait, but wait: the spots are cooler, so the observed flux is lower when they are visible. So the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present is a decrease, so the dip is about 5.177% of the star's normal flux.

But the question is about the equivalent planet transit. So when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's disk.

So the dip caused by the planet is (R_p / R_*)^2.

Wait, but what is the dip? It's (area of planet / area of star) = (π R_p^2) / (π R_*^2 ) = (R_p / R_* )^2.

So if the dip caused by the spots is 5.177% (i.e., a fractional change ΔF/F = -0.05177), then the planet transit dip would be (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177.

Wait, no. Wait, the dip is the maximum fractional decrease in brightness. So when the planet transits, it blocks (R_p/R_*)^2 of the star's light, causing that much dip.

So setting (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root: R_p / R_* = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23, but none of the options are close to that. Hmm. Looking at the options: options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Wait, none of these are near 0.23. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the question.

The problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and when it's facing us, the spots contribute to the brightness.

So the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not. The maximum dip occurs when the spot hemisphere is fully facing us, so the fractional decrease is the difference between the star's full brightness and the brightness with spots.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness when the spots are present as follows:

Without spots, the star's flux is F = σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are present and facing us, the flux is F = (1 - f) * σ T_eff^4 + f * σ T_spot^4.

So the fractional change is:

ΔF/F = [ (1 - f) σ T_eff^4 + f σ T_spot^4 ] / ( σ T_eff^4 ) - 1.

Simplify: [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ] - 1.

Which becomes: -f + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

Which is f ( (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 )

So plugging in the numbers: f is 0.1 (since 20% of hemisphere is 0.1 of the whole star), T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So ΔF/F = 0.1 * (0.4823 - 1 ) = 0.1 * (-0.5177 ) ≈ -0.05177, which is a 5.177% decrease.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.177% of the star's normal flux. So when the spots are visible, the brightness is 5.177% less than when they're not.

But wait, the problem says the star's brightness variations can resemble an exoplanet transit. So to produce the same amplitude, what's the planet radius?

The planet transit causes a dip of (R_p / R_*)^2.

Set this equal to 0.05177.

So R_p / R_* = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.23 R_*. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32, which is 0.32. Wait, that's not close. So either I messed up the calculations, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fractional change. Let me re-express the formula.

ΔF = F_spot - F_unspotted.

F is the star's flux without spots. When spots are present, the flux is F = F_unspotted*(1 - f) ) + F_spotted*f.

Wait, wait, no. The star has two regions: the spotted area and the unspotted area.

The flux from the entire star when spots are present is:

F_total = F_unspotted_area * (1 - f) + F_spotted_area * f.

But F_unspotted_area is the flux per unit area of the unspotted regions, which is σ T_eff^4. Similarly, F_spotted_area is σ T_spot^4.

So F_total = (1 - f) * σ T_eff^4 + f * σ T_spot^4.

The fractional change is (F_total - F) / F.

F is the normal flux, σ T_eff^4.

So (F_total - F)/F = [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ] / T_eff^4.

= [ -f T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / T_eff^4.

= f ( T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4.

= f ( (T_spot / T_eff )^4 - 1 )

Which is exactly what I did before. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the dip is about 5.177% in brightness.

So the planet would need to cause the same dip. So (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p = R_* * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227 R_*. Which is about 0.23 times the star's radius.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option D) 0.32. Wait, no, that's 0.32, which is larger than 0.23. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor. Let me think again about the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2 ) = 0.1 π R^2.

So f is 0.1 (10% of the entire star's surface is covered). Oh wait, wait a minute! Maybe I got the filling factor wrong.

Filling factor is the fraction of the stellar disk covered by spots. If the spots are on one hemisphere, and they cover 20% of that hemisphere, then the filling factor (f) is 0.2 * (hemisphere area / total area) )? No, because the hemisphere is half the total area. So if the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, then in terms of the entire star's area, it's 0.2 * (1/2) = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's area.

Wait, that's what I did. So f is 0.1.

Hmm, so the calculation is correct. So why isn't the answer matching the options? Did I misinterpret the problem?

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the relative brightness variation amplitude, but perhaps it's considering the maximum and minimum brightness, so the total variation would be 2 times the dip. Or maybe not.

Wait, no. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the maximum dip. So it's the same as the dip I calculated.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the variation in brightness when the star is spotty, which could mean both the dip and the increase as the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, that's another possibility. So when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher than the normal. So the total variation is the difference between when the spots are completely visible (minimum brightness) and when they're completely hidden (maximum brightness).

So let me recalculate the amplitude considering both ends.

When the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher than normal.

Wait, no, because the star's brightness is the same whether the spots are on the far side or near side. The brightness only changes when the spots are on the near side, making it dimmer. When the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is the same as if they weren't there. So the maximum brightness (F_max) is when the spots are not visible, and the minimum brightness (F_min) is when the spots are fully visible.

So the dip is F_max - F_min.

Wait, no. The star's brightness when spots are on the far side is F = F_unspotted (since we don't see the spots). When the spots are on the near side, F = F_total, which is lower.

So the maximum brightness is F (normal), and the minimum is F_total.

So the amplitude is (F - F_total)/F.

Which is what I calculated before: 5.177% decrease.

So the amplitude is about 5.177% of F.

Thus, the dip is ~5.177% of the star's brightness.

So the planet's transit needs to cause a dip of the same amplitude, ~5.177%.

So (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p = sqrt(0.05177) * R_* ≈ 0.227 R_*, which is approximately 0.23 R_*.

But looking at the options, none give this. The closest is option D) 0.32. But 0.23 is about 0.23, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness caused by the spots as a periodic modulation. So perhaps it's the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. Which I think I have already correctly calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation as the difference between the spot side and the non-spot side. Wait, let me think in terms of the star's brightness when the spot hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

Wait, when the spot hemisphere is visible, the star's brightness is F_total = (1-f) F_unspotted + f F_spotted.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the brightness is F_unspotted.

So the maximum brightness is F_unspotted, the minimum is F_total.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_total) / F_unspotted.

Which is what I calculated as 5.177%.

So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I got the filling factor wrong. Oh! Wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Because the problem says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor refers to the entire star, but only on one hemisphere. So f is 0.20.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the filling factor is 20%, that could mean 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. But the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, so perhaps the area is 0.20 of the hemisphere.

Wait, the exact phrasing: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 π R^2. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But maybe the question considers the filling factor as the fraction of the entire star's surface. That would change things.

If the filling factor was 20% of the entire star's surface, then f would be 0.2.

So let's recalculate with f=0.2.

ΔF/F = 0.2 * ( (5000/6000)^4 -1 )

(5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. So (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So ΔF/F = 0.2 * (0.4823 - 1 ) = 0.2 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.1035.

So the dip is about 10.35%.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.1035) ~ 0.3217 R_*, which is approximately 0.32. So option D) 0.32.

Ah, that's one of the choices. So I think I must have misread the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says "filling factor of 20%." So is the filling factor 20% of the entire star's surface, or 20% of the hemisphere?

The exact definition: filling factor (f) is the fraction of the visible stellar surface covered by spots. But in the case of a rotating star, when the spot is on the hemisphere, the filling factor refers to the part of the hemisphere that's covered.

Wait, in the problem, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the 20% is for that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) = 0.1 π R^2. So f=0.1.

But if the problem had meant that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then f=0.2.

So which is it? The question says: "the star has an effective temperature of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

Wait, so the star has only one hemisphere with spots, but the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) = 0.1 π R^2.

So f is 0.1.

So why would the correct answer be option D) 0.32?

Because with f=0.1, the dip is about 5.177%, which would require a planet of radius 0.227 R_*, which isn't an option. So perhaps I have the approach wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the variation in the brightness as the star rotates, which includes both the spot and non-spot sides. So the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the near side (minimum brightness) and when they're on the far side (maximum brightness). So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F.

So F_max is the brightness when the spots are on the far side (so F_max = F).

F_min is the brightness when the spots are on the near side (F_min = (1 - f) F + f F_s).

So the amplitude is (F - F_min)/F = 1 - (1 - f + f (F_s / F )).

Which is (f (F - F_s )) / F = f (1 - F_s / F )

Which is f (1 - (T_s / T)^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

So 0.1 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, same as before.

So dip is 5.177%.

So the planet needs to have a dip of 5.177%, which requires R_p = 0.227 R_*, which isn't an option.

Hmm. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the spots' effect on brightness but the rotational modulation leading to a variation as the spots rotate. So the brightness variation could be periodic, perhaps with a certain amplitude. But I'm not sure how else to model it.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness when the spot hemisphere is facing us. So the star is brighter when the spot hemisphere is on the far side (no spots visible) and dimmer when the spot hemisphere is on the near side.

But I think I've already accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem from the perspective of the observer. The star has a certain brightness when the spot is on the back, and a lower brightness when the spot is on the front. The amplitude is the difference between the two.

But the calculation shows a dip of about 5% when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the photometric time-series. As the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a decrease in brightness, then go out of view, causing it to return to normal. So the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is 5.177%.

So the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip.

But none of the options match 0.227.

Wait, unless the problem is considering that the planet transits the entire star, so the dip is (R_p + R_*)^2. No, that can't be right because R_p is much smaller than R_*.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the effect of the spots. Another approach: compute the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side and when they are on the far side.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = ( (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) / (T_eff^4) * F_0, where F_0 is the normal flux.

So F = [ (1 - 0.1) * 1 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4 ] * F_0.

= [ 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.4823 ] * F_0.

= [0.9 + 0.04823 ] * F_0.

= 0.94823 F_0.

So when the spots are on the near side, brightness is ~94.823% of F_0.

When they're on the far side, brightness is 100% F_0.

So the amplitude of the variation is (100% - 94.823%) = 5.177% of F_0.

Which is the same as before.

So the planet's transit would need to block 5.177% of the star's light, so (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177.

Which gives R_p = 0.227 R_*, which is about 0.23 R_*. But the options don't have this.

Looking again at the options: option C is ~0.11, D is ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 exactly.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

(25/36)^2 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. Because according to the calculations, the planet's radius should be about 0.23 R_*, but that's not an option. The closest option is D) 0.32.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the planet to cause the same amplitude as the star's variation, but the star's variation is not just the dip but the full amplitude (from max to min). So the amplitude would be twice the dip.

Wait, in that case, the amplitude would be 2 * 5.177% = 10.354%.

Then, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218 R_*, which is about 0.32 R_*, option D.

Ah! That makes sense. Because the star's brightness varies between F and F_min, with a dip of 5.177%. So the full amplitude is the difference between F and F_min, which is 5.177% of F. But perhaps in photometric terms, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. So from maximum (F) to minimum (F_min) is 5.177% of F. So the amplitude is 5.177%.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, which is F - F_min = 5.177% F. So if the planet's transit causes a dip of the same amplitude (5.177%), then the planet's R is 0.227 R_*, which is not an option.

But if the planet's transit causes a dip of 5.177% of F, then the dip is 5.177%, which is the same as the star's variation. So the planet's R is ~0.227 R_*, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the 'signal' which is symmetric around the mean. So the maximum brightness is F, and the minimum is F_min. The amplitude is (F - F_min) which is 5.177% F. Thus, the planet's transit dip would need to be 5.177% F, which leads to R_p = ~0.227 R_*, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the planet to cause the same maximum drop in brightness, which is 5.177%, so the planet's radius is 0.227 R_*. But the options don't have that.

The available options: A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, if I miscalculated the (5/6)^4 term, perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296.

So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about the planet causing the same maximum brightness variation as the star's spots, but the planet's effect is the same as when the star has spots. So perhaps the star's brightness variation is being mistaken for a planet's transit.

Wait, but the problem states: "Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So the brightness variation from the spots can be mistaken for an exoplanet transit.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet transiting.

So the problem is, to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

So, the spots cause a dip of about 5.177%, which corresponds to a planet of R_p = 0.227 R_*, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered f as 0.2, not 0.1. Let's see.

If f=0.2: ΔF/F = 0.2 (0.4823-1 )= -0.10354.

So dip is 10.354%, so R_p = sqrt(0.10354)=0.3218 R_*, which is option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the problem considers the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

But the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the 20% is for the hemisphere.

So that would imply that the area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2 )= 0.1 π R^2.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the entire star has spots covering 20%, but only on one hemisphere. So it's 20% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, that's a possible misinterpretation. Let me think: if the entire star's surface has 20% spots, but all the spots are on one hemisphere, then when the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see all the 20% spots. So the area is 0.2 * π R^2.

So f=0.2.

In that case, ΔF/F = 0.2 (0.4823 - 1 )= -0.10354.

So the dip is ~10.354%, which requires the planet's R_p to be ~0.32 R_*, which is option D.

So perhaps the confusion is whether the 20% filling factor is for the entire star or just the hemisphere.

In the problem statement, it says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the 20% is of the hemisphere, so f=0.1.

But perhaps the question misuses the term, and the 20% is of the entire star. If that's the case, then f=0.2, and the answer is option D.

Looking at the options, D is the only one that fits with f=0.2.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to take f=0.2, leading to option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) 0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness decreases when the spotted hemisphere is visible due to the cooler spots.
   - The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta F / F \)) depends on the filling factor (\( f \)) and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star.

3. **Planet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, the planet's radius must satisfy this condition.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the Filling Factor
The problem states that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Since a hemisphere covers half the star's surface, the total area covered by spots is:
\[
f = 0.2 \times \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2} = 0.1 \, \text{of the star's total surface area}.
\]

Thus, \( f = 0.1 \).

---

### Step 2: Compute the Fractional Brightness Change
The fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible is given by:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F} = f \left( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 - 1 \right).
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \),
- \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \),
- \( f = 0.1 \).

First, calculate \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \):
\[
\left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
\]

Now compute \( \Delta F / F \):
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.1 \times (0.4823 - 1) = 0.1 \times (-0.5177) \approx -0.05177.
\]

This corresponds to a **5.177% decrease in brightness** when the spots are visible.

---

### Step 3: Relate to the Exoplanet Transit
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]

Set this equal to the fractional brightness change caused by the spots:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177.
\]

Solve for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.227.
\]

---

### Step 4: Analyze the Options
The calculated radius ratio \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the entire star's surface (instead of just the hemisphere), \( f = 0.2 \). Recomputing with \( f = 0.2 \):
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.2 \times (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 \times (-0.5177) \approx -0.1035.
\]

This corresponds to a **10.35% decrease in brightness**. Setting \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035 \), we find:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.32.
\]

This matches **Option D**.

---

### Conclusion
The problem likely assumes the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface (20%), not just the hemisphere. With this interpretation, the radius of the exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation is approximately \( 0.32 R_{\text{star}} \).
