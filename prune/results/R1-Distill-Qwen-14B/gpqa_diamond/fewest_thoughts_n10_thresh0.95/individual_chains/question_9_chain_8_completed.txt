Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the different planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. C3h symmetry specifically involves a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal, meaning it's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options, there are four molecules to consider: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

I think I should analyze each molecule's structure to determine if it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I recall that triisopropyl borate has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. The structure is like B with three identical groups attached. Since all three groups are the same and arranged symmetrically, I think this molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. But wait, does it have a mirror plane? Hmm. Each isopropyl group is arranged symmetrically around B. If I imagine a horizontal mirror plane in the center, would that work? Well, since the molecule is symmetric in all three directions, maybe it does have a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe C could have C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think it's a norbornane derivative. The structure is a bridge bicyclic with a seven-membered ring. Wait, quinuclidine has a chair-like structure with three bridges. I'm not sure about its symmetry. I remember that quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry and a three-fold axis. No, wait, does it? Quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, so maybe it's a three-fold rotation? Or is it more like a mirror plane? Let me think again. Quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, but maybe not a horizontal one. Alternatively, perhaps it has a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane in a different orientation. So perhaps it's C3v symmetry or something else, but not C3h. Not sure yet.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a complex structure. It seems to be a triphenylene fused with a trifuran. The name suggests multiple rings. Let me visualize it. The triphenylene would have three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a larger ring. The trifuran part is a five-membered ring with three oxygen atoms. Wait, the numbering is 1,3,6,8,11,13, which suggests substituents or ketone groups. Hmm, symmetry-wise, if the molecule is highly symmetrical, perhaps with multiple mirror planes and rotation axes. Triphenylene itself is symmetric, maybe with a three-fold rotation axis. If the substituents (like the furan rings) are arranged symmetrically around this axis, then maybe C3h is present.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. This structure is a benzo ring fused with a trifuran, and there are multiple ketone groups. The benzo part is a benzene ring, and the trifuran is a five-membered ring with three oxygens. The numbering suggests the positions. The symmetry here—benzo rings are symmetric, but if the substituents are in positions that disrupt the symmetry, maybe it doesn't have high symmetry. Benzo-fused molecules often have certain planes, but perhaps not a three-fold rotation.

Now, thinking about the C3h symmetry. It requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have a mirror that cuts through it, perhaps in the middle of the structure.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups around boron. Each group is attached to boron, which is trigonal planar. So, the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis. But what about the mirror plane? Since all groups are identical and arranged symmetrically, I think it does have a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry is possible here.

Quinuclidine (option D) I'm a bit confused about. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis, but maybe it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it has a vertical mirror plane. If the symmetry is C3v, then it's a different symmetry class and not C3h.

Looking at the other options: Option A seems to have a triphenylene core, which is symmetric. Triphenylene has three benzene rings connected in a sort of triangular arrangement. If the trifuran parts are attached symmetrically, perhaps each arm is the same. This could mean a three-fold rotation. If the molecule also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Similarly, option B's benzo-fused structure may not have a three-fold rotation. The benzo part is more likely to have a two-fold rotation and maybe a mirror plane perpendicular, but not necessarily a horizontal one for C3h.

So, the key is to find which molecule has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) definitely has a three-fold rotation. Boron is in the center, with three identical groups, so a 120-degree rotation would leave it unchanged. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would pass through the boron and the center of each isopropyl group. Wait, is that possible? Each isopropyl group is arranged in a plane, so a horizontal mirror plane would reflect each isopropyl group onto itself. So yes, it should have a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make it C3h.

Alternatively, if the mirror plane is vertical, that would be a different symmetry (like C3v). But in this case, the mirror plane is horizontal, so yes, C3h.

What about the other options?

Looking at option A, the triphenyleno structure—trienphylene has three benzene rings arranged in a triangle. If each benzene ring has the same substituents, like the trifuran parts, then it would have a three-fold rotation. Also, would it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetrical top to bottom, a horizontal mirror cutting through the middle would leave it unchanged. So perhaps option A does as well.

Hmm, so now I'm a bit confused. Are both options C and A possible? Need to think more carefully.

Wait, option C is triisopropyl borate. Let me imagine its structure. Boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups. Is the molecule planar? Well, the boron is sp2 hybridized, so the molecule is planar. So the three substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, a three-fold rotation axis is present, and any plane that passes through the boron and is perpendicular to the rotation axis would be a mirror plane. But wait, a horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the rotation axis is the C3 axis, then a horizontal plane would be perpendicular to it. So in this case, the mirror plane would be such. So, yes, option C should have C3h symmetry.

What about option A? Let me think. The molecule is triphenyleno fused with trifuran. If the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, then the three substituents (like the trifuran rings) must be arranged symmetrically. Also, for a horizontal mirror plane, the molecule must be symmetric along that plane. So, for example, if you rotate 120 degrees and then reflect over the plane, it looks the same.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. For triphenylene, it's a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings connected in a way that each is at 120 degrees to each other. The trifuran part would add more rings. If the substituents are placed in positions that allow both the rotation and mirror plane, then C3h is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the triphenylene are arranged in such a way that there's a three-fold rotation but no mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple mirror planes but not a horizontal one. Wait, but if it's a triphenylene core, perhaps it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

So now I'm thinking both options C and A could have C3h symmetry. But looking back at the options, let's see:

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Wait, so the question is which of the four has C3h symmetry.

Hmm, I think triisopropyl borate (C) definitely has C3h symmetry. Each isopropyl group is the same, so a three-fold rotation would leave the molecule unchanged, and a horizontal mirror plane would as well. So option C is a candidate.

Looking at option A, it's a more complex structure. I'm not sure about the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is symmetric but the mirror plane is not horizontal, then it wouldn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have that symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the molecule. The name is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. So it's a fusion where the triphenylene is connected to a trifuran in specific positions. The substitution pattern could create symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to corannulene, which is a bowl-shaped molecule. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylene part is symmetric, with the trifuran substituents in such a way that the entire molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Wait, another approach: thinking about the number of symmetry elements. For C3h, there's the three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. The presence of a three-fold rotation and the presence of a horizontal mirror. 

Triisopropyl borate definitely meets this. For the others:

Option A: If the molecule has a three-fold rotation, but no horizontal mirror plane, then it wouldn't be C3h. Alternatively, it could have a mirror plane in a different orientation.

Option B: More likely to have lower symmetry because of the benzo ring.

Option D: Quinuclidine, as I thought earlier, might have a three-fold rotation but perhaps a different mirror plane.

So, the most likely answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the requirements of **C₃h** symmetry. This symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (120° and 240° rotations leave the molecule unchanged) and a horizontal mirror plane (a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis that reflects the molecule onto itself).

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. The triphenylene core is symmetric, with three benzene rings arranged at 120° to each other, suggesting a three-fold rotation axis. However, the trifuran substituents and the overall structure do not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Without a horizontal mirror plane, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system with multiple ketone groups. The benzo ring introduces a two-fold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes but does not support a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, this molecule does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
This molecule has a boron atom at the center, bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (120° and 240° rotations leave it unchanged). Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane that passes through the boron atom and reflects each isopropyl group onto itself. Since it satisfies both the three-fold rotation and the horizontal mirror plane, this molecule exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a seven-membered ring and three bridges. It has a three-fold rotation axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has vertical mirror planes. Since it does not satisfy the requirement for a horizontal mirror plane, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) satisfies the conditions for **C₃h** symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
