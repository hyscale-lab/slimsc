Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused by the notation here. So, the field ψ_f is a fermion field, right? And X is the bosonic field. So the interaction term seems to involve the boson X coupling to fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the question is about which fermion-antifermion pairs the X boson can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that. So, the decay X → f f̄ is only possible if m_X ≥ 2 m_f. 

So first, I need to know the masses of the various fermions. Let me recall their approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV. But wait, that's the current quark mass. However, in most interactions, the constituent mass is higher, but for decay purposes, it's the current quark mass that matters because when you create a quark-antiquark pair, each has that mass. But wait, actually, in the Standard Model, the coupling terms depend on the Yukawa interactions, so I think it's the current mass that's relevant here.

Wait, but the Lagrangian given is L = λ f f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ f f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but perhaps it's more like L = -λ (v + X(y)) f ψ_f(y) f(y)? Or perhaps it's written as the Yukawa coupling term. Wait, the standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ ψ φ, where φ is the scalar, and g is the coupling. So in this case, the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X couples to fermion pairs. So X can decay into two fermions if the energy is sufficient.

So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. 

So let me list the fermion masses. The up and down quarks have very small masses, around 2 MeV each. The strange quark is about 100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. The top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon around 0.1 GeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. 

So when X decays into a pair, the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 3 GeV, because 2 * m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So looking at each fermion:

- Up quark: 2 MeV → 2 * 2 =4 MeV. Well under 6 GeV. So uū is allowed.
- Down quark: same as u, very light. dđ allowed.
- Strange quark: 100 MeV → 200 MeV. Also allowed.
- Charm quark: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV. 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so allowed.
- Bottom quark: 4.5 GeV each → 9 GeV. 9 is way above 6 GeV. So bb̄ is not allowed. So X cannot decay into b and bbar.
- Top quark: way too heavy, so tt̄ is impossible.
- Electron: very light, e+ e- allowed.
- Muon: 0.1 GeV → 0.2 GeV. Allowed.
- Tau: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is above 3 GeV, but the total X mass is 6 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed.

So which fermions are allowed? Let's list all fermions that have m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So possible fermions are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Also, but wait, what about the top? No, top is way too heavy.

Wait, but the options don't include all of these. Let me check the options.

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is 4.5 GeV. 2 *4.5 is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c's mass is 1.5 GeV. 3 GeV is allowed because 6 GeV is the X mass. So c cbar is allowed. Tau is ~1.78 *2 = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So allowed. Mu is 0.1 GeV, so 0.2 GeV allowed. e is negligible.

So this option includes all the allowed fermions except for the top quark which isn't an option here.

Option C includes t tbar. But that's impossible as 2m_t is way higher than 6 GeV. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is 4.5 GeV each, which sums to 9 GeV, so not allowed. So D includes b which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Are these all allowed?

Yes, because 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is allowed because X is 6 GeV. Tau is 1.78 *2=3.56 GeV, allowed. Mu is 0.2, allowed. e is 0.001, allowed. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but the question says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". So perhaps we also need to consider if the fermions are charged or not, but since the Lagrangian has ψ_f and ψ_f, which are probably Dirac fermions, meaning they can annihilate into X. Wait, the interaction term is -λ f f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the notation is a bit unclear, but in any case, assuming it's a Yukawa coupling, the X can couple to any fermion that the Lagrangian allows.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so the fermions that interact are the ones that are present in the Lagrangian. So perhaps the fermion content is limited to those that are in the interaction term.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f(y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps it's meant to be L = -λ (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y) f(y), which would be a Yukawa term. So ψ_f and f are the same fermion field? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be ψ_f and ψ_fbar? Well, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the original question has a typo, but assuming that the interaction is with fermions f, then X can decay into any of the possible f fbar pairs, provided that the mass allows.

So given all that, the correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, option B's decay includes c cbar, which is allowed because 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, that's okay.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \) is possible if the total rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair satisfies \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). This means \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), as \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The approximate masses of the fermions are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, the fermions
