Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass slab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. And it's moving towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I think this is a problem involving relative velocity. So the light is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I recall something about adding velocities in relativity, but wait, since we're dealing with classical mechanics here, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, but wait a second, in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. But for light, it's different because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, according to Einstein's postulate. Oh wait, but this is the speed of light in a medium, not in a vacuum. So perhaps the classical approach applies here.

Wait, so the speed of light inside the glass is c/n. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer. So the observer would see the light moving at (c/n) plus the velocity of the glass, right? Because the glass is moving towards them, so the light's speed would be the sum of the two velocities.

Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the beam is moving forward, and the glass is moving forward, same direction.

Wait, no, if the glass is moving toward the observer, that would mean the direction is towards the observer. But the beam is propagating toward the observer as well. So perhaps the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but how can the glass move towards the observer if the beam is moving towards the observer? Because the beam's movement within the glass is already towards the observer, but the glass itself is moving in the same direction. So perhaps we need to consider the relative velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the velocity addition formula from relativity. Because velocities don't just linearly add when you're dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, but since glass's velocity v is presumably much less than c, maybe the classical approach is sufficient here.

Wait, but in the problem, the options don't seem to involve any square roots or anything, so perhaps it's a classical addition. Let me think.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n towards the observer. But the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v_glass = v (assuming v is the speed of the glass as given in the problem). So when we switch to the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, the speed of the light as observed would be v_light = (c/n) + v. But wait, wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, adding their velocities would be the correct classical approach.

Wait, but let me think again. The light's speed inside the glass is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be c/n + v. But wait, that's assuming v is small compared to c/n. But wait, wait, let me make sure about the directions.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, meaning that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So perhaps the velocities add.

Wait, no, if the light is moving towards the observer at speed v_light = c/n in the glass's frame, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer at speed v in the lab frame, then the observed speed would be v_light + v. So that would be (c/n) + v. But wait, the problem says c=1, so it's 1/n + v.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly match (1/n + v). Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v)

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v)

Hmm, none of these look like 1/n + v. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of the velocity of the light in the lab frame. Let me think of the glass slab moving at velocity v towards the observer. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u = c/n towards the observer. So to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, I need to apply the velocity addition formula.

In the case where the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at velocity v towards the lab frame observer), the velocity u' in the lab frame would be u + v. Because in classical mechanics, velocities add up. So u' = (c/n) + v.

But again, none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, but that's in vacuum. But here, the light is in the glass, which is moving. Wait, no, the light is propagating through the moving glass. So perhaps the propagation speed of the light in the glass is still c/n, but relative to the glass. So in the lab frame, considering the glass is moving at velocity v, the observed speed of light would be c/n + v.

Wait, but if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be c/n + v. Let me compute that expression. Since c=1, it's (1/n) + v.

So, let's see: (1 +n v)/(n + v) can be written as (v + 1/n) / (1 + v n/n) )= (v + 1/n)/(n + v)/n? Wait, perhaps I should manipulate the expressions.

Wait, (1 +n v)/(n + v) = [n v +1]/[n +v] = [ (n v +1) ]/(n +v) )

Alternatively, (1/n + v) is (1 + n v)/n. So if I have (1/n +v) = (1 +n v)/n.

Comparing to option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's different. So option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is (n v +1)/(n +v) = same as (1 +n v)/(n +v). 

Wait, but what I computed is (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n. But option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v). So unless n is 1, these are different. Wait, but if n were 1, the speed of light in the medium is 1, same as in vacuum. But that's not the case here.

Hmm, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the medium's motion and how it affects the light's speed. So, the light's speed in the medium is c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n) + v. But that's what I thought earlier, but that doesn't match any option.

Wait, but maybe the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame, not the speed as observed. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute the speed of the light beam relative to the lab, considering both the light's speed in the medium and the medium's motion.

Wait, another thought: when a medium is moving, the refractive index might change, but I don't think that's the case here. The problem states that the index of refraction is n, so I think that's fixed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the correct approach. Maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but since v is small compared to c, perhaps the classical approach is sufficient.

Wait, let me think again. The light beam's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is c/n + v.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is about the speed of the light in the glass, not as observed from the lab. Wait, but the question says, "speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So it is the speed as observed in the lab.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused between the medium's velocity and the light's velocity.

Wait another approach: Let's model the situation. Let's say the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass at velocity u = c/n relative to the glass. So, the velocity of the light in the lab frame would be u + v = (c/n) + v.

But that's again (1/n) + v when c=1. So, for example, if n=1, the speed would be 1 + v, but wait, that's impossible because nothing can go faster than c=1. So that suggests that my approach is wrong because it's leading to a speed greater than c, which can't happen.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, but when the medium is moving, perhaps the observed speed doesn't just add like that. So maybe I should think in terms of the medium's velocity affecting the refractive index or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the lab frame and the glass's frame. Let me consider the glass moving at velocity v. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u = c/n towards the observer. Then, in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u + v (if glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light). But according to relativity, the speed of light should remain c in any frame, but that's only for light in a vacuum. When it's in a medium, the speed can be different. Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is always c/n, but when the medium is moving, perhaps the observed speed changes.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the concepts here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the understanding that in any frame, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but I don't think that's correct because the medium's velocity would affect the observed speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula correctly.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

In this case, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So u = c/n. The glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) )

Since c=1, this becomes 1 + v/(n).

So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's option A.

Wait, but wait, I applied the relativistic velocity addition formula here, but in reality, since the speed of light is c in all inertial frames, does that apply here? Because the light's speed in the glass is not c, it's c/n. So perhaps the relativistic approach doesn't directly apply, but maybe it does because velocity addition is a general formula.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c. So when we apply the formula, we get the observed speed as (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

But wait, let me check the units. Let's say n is 1, v is 0. Then the speed is 1, which is correct. If n is 1 and v is 0.5, then the observed speed is (1 + 1 *0.5)/(1+0.5) = (1.5)/(1.5) = 1, which is correct because in vacuum, speed of light is 1, regardless of the observer's motion. Wait, but in this case, the medium is moving, but the light is in a medium with n=1, so it's effectively vacuum. So if the glass is moving at v=0.5, and n=1, the observed speed of light is 1, which makes sense because light speed is c in vacuum.

Wait, but in another scenario, say n=2, v=0. So the observed speed would be (1 +0)/(2+0) = 1/2, which is correct because in the glass, light speed is 1/2.

If n=2, v=0.25, then u' would be (1 + 2 *0.25)/(2 +0.25) = (1 + 0.5)/(2.25) = 1.5 / 2.25 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666..., which is less than c=1. That makes sense.

So, applying the relativistic formula gives us option A. So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

2. **Relative Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer in the laboratory. To find the speed of light relative to the observer, we must account for the relative motion of the glass.

3. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here:
   - \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's frame.
   - \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
   - \( c = 1 \), so the formula simplifies to:
     \[
     u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
     \]

4. **Simplification**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression.
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it does not account for the refractive index or the velocity of the glass.
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( n + v \), not \( n - v \).
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator should be \( 1 + n v \), not \( 1 - n v \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately represents the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.
