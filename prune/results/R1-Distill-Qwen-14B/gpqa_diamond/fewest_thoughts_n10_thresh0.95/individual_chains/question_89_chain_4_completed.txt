Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, resulting in product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'll need to figure out the structures of each product, especially product 3, to determine its NMR characteristics.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (dihalides where the halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. The reaction produces a diene if there are two adjacent dihalides, but wait, in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons that are two positions apart, but in adamantane's structure, each carbon is connected in a way that might not allow for easy elimination. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid, with each carbon connected to three others in a tetrahedral arrangement, but in a cage-like structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two non-adjacent carbons, but perhaps in a way that allows for dehydrohalogenation, but wait, dehydrohalogenation requires adjacent leaving groups. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So how would elimination occur?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh! Wait, no, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when KOH is added, it undergoes a double elimination, but that would require adjacent leaving groups. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps each bromine is on a bridgehead carbon, which allows for elimination to form a double bond. Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead carbon is connected to three others, right? So if there's a bromine on two bridgehead carbons, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible because of Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not allowed in bicyclic structures with less than 10 atoms. Oh wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure with a lot of rings, but maybe in this case, elimination is possible because the transition state can accommodate the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but with two bromines in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's a double substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. No, that's when you have an alcohol and acid, or specific conditions. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and IR at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak at 1720 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But wait, in the presence of KOH, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of elimination leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, how? If two adjacent dihalides eliminate, perhaps forming a carbonyl. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would require that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier about the structure.

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads. So if two bridgeheads each have a bromine, perhaps elimination can occur. Let me think: when two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose a bromide, forming a double bond between them. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule. So maybe the elimination isn't forming a double bond but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an intramolecular elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak for a carbonyl, like a ketone. So product 1 probably has a ketone. How would 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH form a ketone?

Ah! Maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to a ring opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone via a pinacol-like mechanism. Wait, pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols eliminating water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we have di-bromides.

Another angle: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent X's) undergo elimination with a strong base like KOH, they typically form alkenes. But since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the bromines are not adjacent, so elimination would not form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to a double elimination, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, if each elimination forms a double bond, but that seems unlikely. Or maybe two eliminations occur, each removing a Br and a H, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think: when two vicinal X groups are present, elimination leads to an alkene. But if they are not vicinal, maybe two elimination steps are needed. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for two elimination steps, each giving a double bond, but that's not making much sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product after KOH treatment is a diepoxy compound. No, because KOH isn't usually for epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening to form a diketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR data. Product 1's 1H NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's around the region for an -OH proton, but in the presence of KOH, which is a strong base, maybe that's an -O- group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide, but the IR at 1720 would suggest a carbonyl, which isn't present in an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is adamantanone, which has a ketone group. Let's imagine that the KOH causes the elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. That would fit the IR data, as a ketone has a strong C=O stretch around 1720 cm^-1.

The NMR data: 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. For example, if it's a CH2 adjacent to a ketone, like in a ketone where the carbonyl is part of a bridge. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH2 group, perhaps further away from the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But the NMR doesn't show a strong peak for a diketone's CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: the 4.79 ppm peak could be from an -O-CH2-O- group, like in a diethyl ether or similar. But that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but in that case, the peaks might be broader or split differently.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. But again, the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes two elimination reactions, each removing HBr, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

For example, two adjacent Br atoms would eliminate to form a double bond, but in this case, they might be on bridgehead carbons, which can't form a double bond. So perhaps each Br is eliminated, and their positions lead to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me think: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, their elimination could form a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed, so maybe instead, a ketone forms. But I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double substitution, but then we'd have two -OH groups, but the IR indicates a carbonyl, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, considering the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2O or OCH2-. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group, which would cause some deshielding.

The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests multiple CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a cage-like structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps near a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps product 1 is an adamantanone with some substituents. For example, if the two Br atoms are at positions that, upon elimination, form a ketone group. So the structure might be 1,3-diketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a mono-ketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, maybe I should move to the second step and see if that gives any clues. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane derivatives don't have. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for some kind of acetylation or alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation or enolization. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but as I said, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a result of acetylation. Wait, product 1 has a ketone group. If it reacts with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolate formation, leading to ring expansion or other structural changes.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the second product is. Product 2 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Another thought: maybe product 1 is a diol. If product 1 is a diol, then treatment with a Lewis acid might lead to a cyclization, forming a cyclic ether or something else. But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't fit, as epoxides don't have a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle: the first product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high field for a CH2, but maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether. But with a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone with a CH2OCH3 group or similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a gem-dimethyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit the 2H at 4.79.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group that's part of an ester or a carbonyl compound. Wait, but in the presence of KOH, it's more likely a hydroxide substitution. Hmm.

Let me try to think of the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1.

Another thought: perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require two substitutions, which would give a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, unless it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Each Br is eliminated with a H from adjacent carbons, forming two double bonds but that's not possible in adamantane's structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form a double bond, but that wouldn't produce a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps KOH induces a ring-opening of adamantane, forming a more open structure with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. But since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which I think is a vicinal dihalide, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on the same carbon? No, no, each carbon in adamantane is only connected to three others. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on non-adjacent carbons. So elimination would not form a double bond because the H and Br would have to be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, but that's not allowed. So perhaps instead, each Br leaves, and a ring contraction occurs, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the IR data again. Product 1 has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

Now, considering the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the OH groups lose a proton each, leading to a ketone. Wait, but that would require some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to two adjacent carbonyls. No, that's not likely.

Wait, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't fit that. So perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps each elimination step removes one H and one Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So two eliminations would form two carbonyl groups, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe a single elimination forms a carbonyl and a double bond, but then the IR would show a double bond peak as well, which the question doesn't mention.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. For example, when 1,2-dibromoethane reacts with KOH, it forms ethylene. But if the two bromines are not adjacent, perhaps another pathway is taken. Alternatively, perhaps the structure here is such that the two elimination steps can occur, each leading to a carbonyl group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too stuck. Let me move on to the next step and see if that helps.

The second step is product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. However, since product 1 is likely a ketone, perhaps product 2 is formed via some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it forms a cyclic structure, like a cyclic ether or a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid could undergo ring-opening, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the Lewis acid catalyzes some kind of enol formation, leading to a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, that requires an aromatic ring, which I don't think product 1 has.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, but earlier reasoning suggests that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third step, which involves ozonolysis. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. But in this case, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2, which suggests that product 2 has a double bond.

So perhaps product 3 is the result of cleaving a double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Putting this together, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would be a di-ketone or similar.

Wait, but let's go back. After product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's forming some kind of enol or enolate, which could lead to a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, formed via elimination from product 1.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group. If product 2 is a diene, perhaps product 1 is a ketone that, under Lewis acid conditions, loses a water molecule to form a conjugated diene. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, then dehydration could form a diene.

Wait, for example, if product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, heating with a Lewis acid could cause it to lose water and form a conjugated diene. Then, product 2 would be a diene, which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups.

So, putting this together: product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a diene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product with carbonyl groups.

Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3âwhat's its coupling pattern?

Wait, so product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, potentially leading to two carbonyl compounds.

But I need to figure out the structure of product 3 to determine the coupling pattern.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 2 is a diene, perhaps it's a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically yield two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups, maybe. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups connected to adjacent CH2 groups.

But let's think about the coupling in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, such as a carbonyl.

In the NMR of product 3, when you have a carbonyl group, the adjacent hydrogens (if any) would show up as triplets, doublets, etc., depending on their neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but ozonolysis usually cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break both double bonds and form two ketones or aldehydes. But in this case, the starting material is adamantane derivatives, so the diene would be part of a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Let's say the diene is part of a bridge structure. Ozonolysis would then cleave it into two carbonyl groups, each attached to some CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone group adjacent to a CH2 group. So the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have their hydrogens. The coupling pattern would depend on how many neighboring hydrogens each H has.

For example, if each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each hydrogen on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, consider a structure like (CH2)n where n is a small number. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would couple with the neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group.

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs on each CH2. So each H on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, but wait, if each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then each H would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps another CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to one carbonyl and one CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that's just a simple example.

In that case, each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2. So each H on a CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So for each H, the coupling would be with two neighboring Hs on each side.

Wait, in such a scenario, each H on a CH2 would be a quartet (n+1 where n=3?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is between two carbonyls, the Hs on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2. So each H would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. Each CH2 has two Hs. If each H on a CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 with two Hs, then each H would be split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). But wait, if it's coupled with two sets of Hs, maybe it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are in a chain, each adjacent to another CH2. So each CH2's Hs would be split by the neighboring CH2's two Hs. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but product 3 is from ozonolysis of product 2, which is from product 1 treated with Al(OiPr)3.

Maybe product 2 is a diene that, upon ozonolysis, breaks into two aldehyde groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would produce two aldehydes. But in the context of adamantane derivatives, the structure would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, leading to a single ozonolysis product with two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups, each connected to CH2 groups.

In that case, each of those CH2 groups would have neighboring Hs, leading to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, another thought: the most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

If the structure is like O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO, then each CH2 would be next to another CH2. The Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2's two Hs. So each H would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs).

But wait, if each CH2 has two Hs, and they're next to another CH2 with two Hs, then each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are each adjacent to another CH2, leading to a triplet coupling pattern for those Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and a CH group, leading to a different splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CHO. In that case, the CH2 group would have Hs that couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH (if any), but if it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl and another CH2, the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, meaning each CH2 is between two carbonyls. In that case, each CH2's Hs would be adjacent to another CH2 group, so each H would be split by two Hs on each side. Wait, no, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group on either side, but that would require a longer chain, which may not fit the starting material.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of Hs. Product 3's 1H NMR would have a peak for the most deshielded H. If the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, in the case of CH2=CH2, each H is a quartet because they're coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. But that's for double bonds, which is different.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO. In that case, the CH2 group would have Hs that are next to the aldehyde group. The aldehyde H is deshielded and would appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but it's probably exchanged with the solvent, so it's not observed in the NMR. The CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would have Hs that are split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, let me get back to the problem. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, excluding those that exchange. So perhaps this H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-X, where X is another group, then the CH2 Hs would be split by any neighboring Hs. For example, if X is another CH2 group, each H on the CH2 would be split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3).

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would be split by two Hs on each side, but that would require a longer chain.

Another possibility is that the CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each of which has two Hs. So each H on the CH2 would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So in product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and their coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, A) triplet is an option.

Wait, but what about options B, C, D? Could there be a more complex splitting?

If the CH2 group is next to another CH2 which is next to another group with Hs, perhaps the splitting would be more complex. For example, if there's a CH group adjacent, perhaps each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another set of Hs elsewhere, leading to a triplet of triplets or other multiplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the most straightforward scenario is that each H on the CH2 group is split into a triplet, so the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another angle: if the CH2 group is part of a larger system, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets, which would be option B.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs, and also another CH2, then the splitting could be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's try to think of a specific example.

Suppose product 3 has the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 would be between two C=O groups. The Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on each side. But wait, in this case, each CH2 is flanked by two C=O groups, so the Hs on each CH2 would only see the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So each H would have two neighboring Hs on one side, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in such a structure, each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to another CH2 group on both ends. But that's not possible because the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, which is a four-carbon chain with two carbonyls at each end. The middle CH2 groups would each have two Hs, and each H would be adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, no. Let me correct: the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet, as they are split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Similarly, the Hs on the second CH2 would be next to two Hs on the first CH2, so also triplets.

So in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH group rather than a CH2, the coupling pattern would be different. For example, a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups would have more complex splitting.

But according to the problem statement, the most deshielded H is not exchanging with the solvent. So perhaps it's on a CH2 group near a carbonyl, leading to a triplet.


The problem involves determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, formed through a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   The reaction with KOH likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone due to the IR absorption at 1720 cmâ»Â¹. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the formation of a ketone with adjacent CHâ groups.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al(OiPr)â**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces dehydration of the ketone, forming a conjugated diene (product 2). This diene is critical for the next step.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bonds in the diene, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   The CHâ group adjacent to the carbonyl is flanked by two hydrogens on the same carbon and two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group. This results in a splitting pattern where each hydrogen on the CHâ group is coupled with two hydrogens on the neighboring CHâ group, leading to a **triplet** coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet.
