Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about choosing the right reagents for two different reactions. Alright, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So the starting material is a ketone. Then, it's reacting with sodium cyanide and some reagent A. 

I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. Oh wait, the formation of a cyanohydrin! Right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile. But wait, the reaction conditions matter. I think that the reaction between ketones and CN- under acidic conditions leads to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So, A must be an acid. Because without acid, the reaction might not proceed as efficiently. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, in the presence of an acid like H3O+ (option A or B), the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic, which then allows the CN- to attack.

So for the first part, A is probably H3O+ because that's a common acid catalyst for this kind of addition. That points towards either option A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. Oh, I think that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But what are those conditions?

I remember that nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, typically you use something like H2SO4 and heat. But wait, in the presence of water. Alternatively, maybe it's using a strong acid. Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH or something else.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Let me think. The structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile attached to some benzyl group. So when the nitrile group (CN) is hydrolyzed, it becomes COOH (carboxylic acid). 

So the nitrile is at the end of the chain. Normally, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acidic or basic conditions plus water. In acidic conditions, H2SO4 and water with heating would be typical. But the options don't have H2SO4. Let's see the options for B.

Wait, the problem says reagent B is (H2O). Or wait, no, in the question, it says the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Or wait, no, the way it's written is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So perhaps B is in parentheses, meaning that B is H2O? Or wait, maybe B is a reagent, and the reaction is done in H2O. Hmm, perhaps the reagent is an acid catalyst in the presence of water.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. The starting material is a 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Let me think about the mechanism. 

Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions would go through a protonation step. So if the reagent is HCl (as in option A and C), then in acidic conditions, the nitrile could be hydrolyzed with H2O in the presence of HCl as a catalyst. Alternatively, if it's using something like CH3COOH (like in option B or D), that's a mild acid.

Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Maybe the hydrolysis is via the hydroxyl group acting as a base or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of the cyanohydrin, which is what the first reaction does.

Wait, looking back, the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the initial reaction adds CN- to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin. Then, in the second step, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, the reagent is B, and it's in H2O. So perhaps B is an acid catalyst. Let's think about the typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis.

Nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic (like H2SO4) or basic (like NaOH) conditions. But the options given don't include H2SO4. Let's look at the options.

Option A: B = HCl. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is in H2O with HCl as the acid. So it's HCl in H2O. That would be an acidic environment, suitable for hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Option B: B = CH3COOH. So acetic acid as the acid. That's a mild acid, but perhaps sufficient for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction needs a strong acid.

Wait, but wait, the starting material in the second reaction is a secondary alcohol (the 2-hydroxy group) and a nitrile. So when we add H2O with an acid catalyst, the nitrile would hydrolyze. But I'm not entirely sure about the conditions for that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the cyanohydrin (from the first reaction) is being oxidized. No, because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is one oxidation state higher than the nitrile. Wait, but nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. How is that done?

Typically, nitriles are oxidized to carboxylic acids using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or other conditions. But the options don't include such reagents. Alternatively, I'm confusing the mechanisms.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis. So nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides, then to acids, under certain conditions. Alternatively, I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, let me think. Under acidic conditions, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. So reagent B is HCl (strong acid), so that would make H+ available, which would help in the hydrolysis. Alternatively, acetic acid (mild acid) might also work, but perhaps the reaction requires a stronger acid.

Looking at the options, for the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is in aqueous HCl. If B is acetic acid, then the reaction is in aqueous acetic acid.

Which one would be more appropriate for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid? I think HCl is a strong acid, so it might be the right catalyst. Alternatively, the presence of H2O is necessary, but the acid is the catalyst.

So, in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). In the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (so options A or C), or CH3COOH (options B or D).

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, from the first reaction's analysis, I thought A is H3O+.

So, looking for options where A is H3O+. That would be options A or B.

Now, for B, which should be HCl or CH3COOH.

In the second reaction, which reagent is better?

Wait, another approach: The nitrile is part of a cyanohydrin. So maybe the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile. For hydrolysis, perhaps we need a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the reaction.

Wait, the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So maybe the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, but the actual structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group, which is on the same carbon.

Wait, but regardless, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid with the appropriate conditions.

In the second reaction, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So that's the nitrile converted to a COOH group. So, the nitrile (CN) becomes COOH.

I think the reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the options only give HCl or CH3COOH as B, perhaps HCl is the better choice because it's a strong acid, providing the necessary conditions for the hydrolysis.

So, putting it together, A should be H3O+ (from the first reaction), and B should be HCl. That would correspond to option A.

Wait, but wait: Another possibility is the use of a sulfonic acid as a catalyst, but that's not among the options.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is the acid. So if the first reaction uses H3O+ (A = H3O+), then the second reaction uses B = HCl (so option A).

Alternatively, another thought: Could the second reaction involve a hydrolysis in basic conditions? But the options don't have bases for B. So, perhaps not.

Wait, but wait: The second reaction's reagent is written as B (H2O), which implies that B is H2O, but that can't be right because that's the solvent. Or perhaps it's a typo, and B is the catalyst in addition to H2O.

Wait, no, the question says for the second reaction, the reagent is B, and it's in H2O. Or perhaps the way it's phrased is "B (H2O)" meaning that B is H2O? That would be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps B is the catalyst, and the solvent is H2O.

Wait, the way it's written is: 2-(...) butanenitrile + B (H2O) → product. So maybe B is H2O. That can't be right because then B is just water. But that's probably not, because in the options, B is a reagent, not the solvent.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is that in the second reaction, B is H2O, but the options list B as HCl, etc. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the parentheses are indicating that H2O is used with B. So B is a catalyst in H2O.

In any case, let's proceed. For the second reaction, the conditions are H2O and B. So, if B is HCl, then it's HCl in H2O, which is an acidic aqueous solution.

So, the conclusion is that for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (so options A or C). So looking for A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which needs acid. So A is H3O+.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Which reagent is used? Let me recall: For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, one common method is using H2O with H2SO4 as a catalyst. But since H2SO4 isn't an option, perhaps HCl is used as the acid.

Wait, but HCl in H2O would be a strong acid solution. Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction uses HgSO4 as a catalyst, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction uses a mild acid, like acetic acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but the options don't have bases.

Wait, considering the options again, option C has A as NaHSO3. Hmm, but NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3- which is a weaker acid than H3O+. So why would that be used in the first reaction?

Wait, the first reaction is the addition of CN- to a ketone. Under what conditions does that happen? I think that the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile in the ketone. But to form the cyanohydrin, the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic. So acid catalysis is required.

NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, no. NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- (bisulfite). But wait, HSO3^- is a weak acid, but in aqueous solution, perhaps it can act as an acid.

Wait, but H3O+ is a stronger acid than HSO3^-? Because H3O+ is a stronger acid (pKa ~-1.7), while HSO3^- has a pKa of around 1.7 (so it's a weaker acid than H3O+).

So for the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, then the solution is acidic because HSO3^- can donate a proton.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

If A is H3O+, then that's a strong acid, which protonates the ketone, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- (from NaCN) to attack.

If A is NaHSO3, which provides H+ (since it's a salt of a weak acid), then it can also protonate the ketone. But why would that be better?

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. Maybe in the presence of sulfite, some other reaction happens, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfite is a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the catalyst, and the second uses HCl.

Wait, but in the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So looking for A=H3O+ and B=HCl would be option A.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: A=H3O+ (acid catalyst), so options A or B.

Second reaction: B=HCl (acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis), so option A.

Therefore, the correct option is A.


The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the ketone reacts with cyanide ion (CN⁻) to form a cyanohydrin. Acid catalysis is required to protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the options provided do not include strong bases, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. **HCl** is a strong acid and an appropriate choice for catalyzing this hydrolysis. Therefore, **B = HCl**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a mild acid, it is less effective than HCl for nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction as it is less effective than H₃O⁺ for protonating the ketone.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is less effective than HCl for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
