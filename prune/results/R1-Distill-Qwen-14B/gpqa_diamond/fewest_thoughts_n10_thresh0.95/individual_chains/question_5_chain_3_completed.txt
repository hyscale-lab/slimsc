Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that the operator is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or spin-down along a given direction.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it's an arbitrary direction but lying in x-z. So we can represent it with spherical coordinates where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, but maybe that's not important right now.

Wait, the question is about the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenstate is the spin-up state along the direction vector n.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator components are given by P = (P_x, P_y, P_z), where each component is (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

I remember that the operator for an arbitrary direction can be written as P·n, which is the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. So the operator we're interested in is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, and then figure out its elements given the options.

First, I'll write down the matrices for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because when phi is zero (since it's in x-z), the direction is along (x, z). Wait, no, the general direction in spherical coordinates is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in x-z, φ is 0, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), because n_y is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, when the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero, so the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, wait: the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis (positive), so the components are (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So since phi is zero, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But n should be a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y is zero.

So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the P matrices:

P·n = (n_x * ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Because n_y is zero, the P_y term doesn't contribute.

So let's compute this.

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P·n is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, let me compute each term:

n_x * P_x is (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z * P_z is (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these two matrices together:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) cosθ * 1 + (ħ/2 sinθ)*0 = (ħ/2) cosθ.

The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) sinθ *1 + (ħ/2 cosθ)*0 = (ħ/2) sinθ.

Similarly, (2,1) is same as (1,2), which is (ħ/2) sinθ.

And (2,2) element is (ħ/2 cosθ)(-1) + 0 = -(ħ/2) cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the (1,1) is cosθ*(ħ/2), (1,2) is sinθ*(ħ/2), (2,1) is same as (1,2) because P_x is symmetric, and (2,2) is -cosθ*(ħ/2). So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

So the operator P·n is that matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvectors satisfy (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is identity matrix.

So for λ = +ħ/2, the matrix P·n - λ I is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
[ (ħ/2 sinθ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, no: because λ is +ħ/2, so subtracting λ I gives each diagonal element as (component) - lambda.

So the matrix becomes:

For (1,1): (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)
(1,2): (ħ/2 sinθ)
(2,1): same as (1,2)
(2,2): (-ħ/2 cosθ ) - (ħ/2) = -ħ/2 (cosθ + 1)

So the matrix is:

[ [ (cosθ-1) (ħ/2), (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2)(cosθ +1) ] ]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each row, so the equation becomes:

[ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -(cosθ +1) ] ] * [a; b] = 0

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

These are two equations. Let's write the first one:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b --> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Wait, but let's see. Let me work this through.

From the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 can be rewritten as -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's substitute:

a = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * b

Which is cot(theta/2) * b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

So if we let b = 1, then a = cot(theta/2), but wait, but we need to normalize the vector.

Wait, but cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So a = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ].

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). Because:

If a = cot(theta/2) * b, then if b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let's check with the second equation to see if this is consistent.

Second equation: sinθ a - (cosθ +1 ) b = 0

Substituting a = cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2):

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - (cosθ +1) sin(theta/2) = ?

Let me compute each term.

Express sinθ as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So first term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

Second term: (cos theta +1) sin(theta/2).

Cos theta can be written as 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2). So cos theta +1 = 2 (1 - sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So second term: 2 cos²(theta/2) * sin(theta/2).

So substituting, the equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = 0.

Which is zero. So it satisfies the second equation.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector is actually [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but what is the normalization factor? The vector should have unit length. So sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) = 1.

But if a = cos(theta/2) and b= sin(theta/2), then |a|² + |b|² = cos²(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1. So the vector is already normalized.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but the options have some terms with ħ and square roots.

Wait, wait, let's re-examine the problem. The options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, so option C is exactly what I derived. But wait, this is a quantum state, so the components are usually dimensionless, but sometimes represented with factors of ħ, but in this case, the eigenvector would just be a vector, so perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but the options have normalization factors. Let me think again. Did I miss any normalization?

Wait, the operator is P·n, which has eigenvalues plus or minus ħ/2. So the eigenvector is a spinor, and the components are the spin-up and spin-down along n. So in the standard spin-1/2 basis, the eigenstates are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi =0, so the eigenstate is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, looking at the options, option C is exactly that, without any normalization factors other than the angles.

So I think option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the components. Are there any factors of ħ involved in the eigenvector?

Hmm, no, because eigenvectors are just state vectors, which are dimensionless. So the components I found are correct, and option C matches.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]
Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and simplifying:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0
\]

From the first equation:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Substituting $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to normalize the vector), we get:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

Comparing this result with the options:
- **Option A** and **Option D** include factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the eigenvector components in quantum mechanics.
- **Option B** introduces $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary since $\phi = 0$ for the x-z plane.
- **Option C** matches exactly with the derived eigenvector.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
