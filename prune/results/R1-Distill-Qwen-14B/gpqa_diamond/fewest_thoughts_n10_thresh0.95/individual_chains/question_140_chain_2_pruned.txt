--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by reading through the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just above that. 

Also, the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it. Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to figure out what X is, then identify its constituent elements and sum their lightest and heaviest masses.

Let me think about each part step by step.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests something like a strong acid reacting with a carbonate or something similar, releasing gas. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. CO2 has 12 (protons) and 16 (neutrons in carbon-12 is 6, oxygen-16 is 8. So each molecule of CO2 has 6+8=14 neutrons and 12 protons. No, that doesn't match. Wait, each molecule's total. Let me think: for example, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. But that's not same neutrons and protons. Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is something like CH4? No, protons would be 4 (from C) + 4*(1) = 8; neutrons would vary based on isotope. Wait, but the problem says the gas's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, total protons equals total neutrons.

Wait, maybe the gas is H2. Because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So for H2, 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't match. Or maybe CO? Let's see. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO would have 6+8=14 protons, 6+8=14 neutrons. Oh, that's a match. So W could be CO, but wait, is CO a gas? At room temperature, yes, it's a gas. But wait, CO is a common industrial gas, but in the context of reactions, maybe.

Wait, another possibility: NH3? No, because N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So NH3 has 7+3=10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14, which has 7 neutrons) and each H has 0. So 7 neutrons. 10 protons vs 7 neutrons. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CH3Cl? No, not sure. Wait, maybe the gas is N2. Nitrogen gas, N2. Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N-14). So each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That would fit. So W would be N2. But wait, does that make sense in the reaction?

So if W is N2, let's think about the reaction. X reacting with Y to produce N2. What kind of reaction produces nitrogen gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ammonium compound reacting with a base.

Wait, another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like water (0°C) but that's too low. Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, but when heated, G would decompose. Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide.

Wait, but earlier we thought W is CO. Let me think again. If the reaction produces CO, perhaps X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, but carbonate plus acid gives CO2, not CO. Hmm, but W is CO, maybe that suggests a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else. Let's think about what produces CO. Maybe a reaction between a metal and a weak acid, but that usually gives H2, not CO. Or perhaps a reaction involving alcohol and a strong acid, like in a lab to produce CO.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. When a carbonate reacts with an acid, it produces CO2 gas. But earlier I thought W was CO, but this would suggest CO2. So maybe I'm wrong about W being CO.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2. Let's see: CO2 molecule has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), each O has 8 (if O-16). So total neutrons 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That matches. So W is CO2.

So, the reaction is probably between X (a carbonate) and Y (an acid), producing CO2, water, and a precipitate. Wait, when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2, water, and a salt. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4 or HCl, but in this case, maybe it's a strong acid, and X is a metal carbonate.

But wait, the precipitate would form if the acid is not in excess and the product is insoluble. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid that reacts with X (a carbonate) to produce CO2, water, and a salt, but if the salt is insoluble, it precipitates.

Wait, but the question says that when heated, precipitate G releases B. So G is a carbonate? No, because when a carbonate is heated, it usually decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might decompose it.

Wait, let me think again. So G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If G is a hydroxide, heating it could dehydrate it into a metal oxide. For example, heating copper hydroxide would produce copper oxide and water. But then, what about B?

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate. Heating a carbonate (like calcium carbonate) would decompose into CO2 and metal oxide, but that would mean B is the oxide. But the melting point of B is near 277 K, so B is a solid that's just starting to melt around 4°C. So maybe B is something that melts at that temperature, perhaps water ice? No, that's 273 K. 277 is slightly higher, so maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: B could be a solid like ammonium chloride. Wait, no, because when you heat ammonium chloride, it doesn't produce a gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal like mercury, which is liquid around room temperature. Mercury's melting point is about 234 K, which is lower than 277. Hmm.

Wait, what's 277 K in Celsius? 277 K is 4°C because K = °C + 273.15. So 277 - 273.15 ≈ 3.85°C. So melting at about 4°C. What solid melts around that temperature? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's lower. Or perhaps it's a different substance.

Wait, maybe B is a solid like a metal oxide. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on B here. Let's try another approach.

The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps something like a strong base or a reducing agent.

Wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So one of its elements has a heavy isotope. That might suggest that X contains H, because H has isotopes (like deuterium). Or maybe another element with common isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. But if X is a reagent in organic chemistry, common reagents are things like NaOH, KOH, NH3, etc. Wait, another possibility: X could be a metal, like sodium or potassium, but incorporating a heavier isotope.

Wait, but the problem says X reacts with Y to produce CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. When a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get a salt, water, and CO2. So for example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2.

So if W is CO2, then Y is an acid, X is a carbonate. The precipitate G would form if the acid is not in excess and the product is insoluble. But if the acid is a strong acid and the salt is soluble, then no precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid. Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is water, but that doesn't make sense for a violent reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid. For example, metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas (H2), but earlier I thought W was CO2. So perhaps I need to reconcile these.

Wait, let me think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, because a keto acid (like a ketone) reacting with something might add oxygen. Wait, no, maybe it's a reduction. Let me think. Wait, if X is a strong reducing agent, like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is used in organic chemistry. NaBH4 has Na, B, and H.

But then, when NaBH4 reacts with a keto acid (like cyclohexanone), it would reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol. The product would have an OH group, which doesn't directly relate to 2 oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something else.

Wait, another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a diol, but no, that adds hydroxyls. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a base. Let's think about Grignard reagents. Grignard reagents react with ketones to form secondary alcohols. But that would add an oxygen from the ketone, not sure how that gives 2 oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH, which when reacting with a keto acid (like a ketone) doesn't directly react, unless under specific conditions. Wait, maybe I'm getting off track here.

Let me try to think about X being a reagent. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like NaOH, KOH, NH3 (ammonia), H2SO4 (concentrated), etc. If X is a reagent that reacts violently, perhaps with an acid, it's something like a carbonate. Wait, but earlier we thought that reaction produces CO2.

Wait, another possibility: X could be a metal, like magnesium, reacting with an acid to produce H2 gas. But then W would be H2, which has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons=2, neutrons=0, which doesn't match the condition. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Let me try to reconstruct what I have so far.

- Gas W: same protons and neutrons in molecule. CO2 fits because 12 (6 C, 8 O *2) protons and 12 (6 C, 8 O *2) neutrons. So W is CO2.

So reaction between X and Y is a carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2, water, and a salt (precipitate G if the salt is insoluble).

Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of ~4°C. So B is a solid that's just starting to melt a bit above 0°C.

Wait, another thought: If G is a carbonate, when heated, it might decompose. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) when heated to high temperatures (above 837°C) decomposes into CaO and CO2. But that's way higher than 277 K. So B can't be CO2 again.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, copper(II) hydroxide, which when heated, decomposes into copper(II) oxide and water. But then, what's B? The oxide. The melting point of copper(II) oxide is around 1400°C, way higher than 4°C. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another angle: What if G is a nitride? Heating a nitride would produce other products, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about B: melting point near 277 K (4°C). What's a substance that's a solid at room temp and melts just above 0°C? Maybe something like camphor? Or perhaps B is a solid like ammonium chloride, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid like ice, but ice melts at 273 K, which is close to 277. Hmm, 277 K is 4°C, so ice would melt at 0°C, so B must be something that starts to melt around that region. Alternatively, maybe it's a solid like a certain metal that has a low melting point.

Wait, another thought. If B is a solid that decomposes when heated, perhaps it's a carbonate that decomposes upon heating. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) decomposes at high temperatures into Na2O and CO2. But the melting point of sodium oxide is around 1460°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is not a decomposition product but rather a substance that's a solid at room temperature and melts just above 0°C. Let me think of such substances. Mercury is liquid at room temperature, so it's out. Maybe something like paraffin wax, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like a certain type of alcohol, but those usually melt below 0°C.

Wait, maybe B is a solid like a certain diatomic molecule. Wait, perhaps it's solid CO2, but that's dry ice, which sublimates directly to gas at room temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is water. But water's melting point is 273 K. 277 K is 4°C, which is just above. So perhaps B is water, but when would it be a solid? If G when heated produces water, then G must be something that upon heating gives water and another product. For example, G could be a hydrate. When heated, the hydrate loses water. So B would be water.

Wait, no, because when you heat a hydrate, water is released. So the solid after heating would be the anhydrous form. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G could be a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. Then B is CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like a certain metal. For example, mercury is a liquid near room temp, so maybe another metal with a low melting point. Let me think: gallium melts around 29°C, which is higher than 4°C. Indium melts around 156°C. No, that's too high. What about something like cesium or rubidium? No, their melting points are higher.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe B is a solid like ammonium nitrate, but I'm not sure about its melting point.

Wait, perhaps I should shift focus to the product of X and a keto acid. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about possible reactions.

If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is a ketone, the reaction would be something like a nucleophilic addition. For example, NaOH (a strong base) reacting with acetone (a ketone) would produce a carbanion, but that's in a solution. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol, which would have an OH group, but that's one oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: if X reduces the keto acid. For example, using a reducing agent like NaBH4 or LiAlH4. Let's say X is NaBH4. When it reacts with a ketone (like acetone), it produces a secondary alcohol. The alcohol molecule would have an OH group, adding one oxygen from the ketone. Wait, no, the ketone has an O, and the alcohol has an O as well. So the product would have an O, but maybe the question is about the number of O atoms in the product molecule.

Wait, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Let's think: if X is something that adds an O. Alternatively, perhaps X is a dienophile or something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a reagent that adds two O atoms. Let's think: in organic chemistry, KMnO4 can oxidize alkenes to diols under certain conditions, but that adds two OH groups, but it's more about oxidation. Alternatively, maybe X is something like ozone, but I don't think that adds two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that converts a ketone into a carboxylic acid. For that, you'd need a strong oxidizing agent. KMnO4 can do that under acidic conditions. So if X is KMnO4, and the keto acid is a ketone, the product would be a carboxylic acid, adding an O. But would the product have two O atoms? Let me see: a ketone (like acetone, (CH3)2CO) has one O. Oxidizing it would give a carboxylic acid (like propanoic acid, CH2(COOH)CH3?), wait no, acetone oxidizes to propanoic acid, which has two O's in the -COOH group. So the product would have two O atoms: one in the CO and another in the OH.

Wait, but the problem states that the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So acetone has one O, and the product (propanoic acid) has two O's in the COOH group. That fits. So in this case, X is KMnO4 (a strong oxidizing agent), and Y might be something else in the reaction.

But wait, earlier we were thinking that X is a carbonate reacting with acid Y to produce CO2. So maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me try to tie this together.

If X is KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent, and when it reacts with a liquid Y (maybe an acid?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, and the reaction produces O2 or something else.

Wait, but the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has 2 O's. So perhaps X is a reagent that adds an O, making the product have 2 O's. Another possibility is that X is a reagent that converts a ketone (which has one O) into something with two O's. Like adding an O.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is something like H2O2. When H2O2 reacts with a ketone under certain conditions, it can oxidize the ketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the reaction is a Grignard addition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid. But that wouldn't add O's.

Wait, maybe X is something like H2SO4, a strong acid. When it reacts with a ketone, perhaps it doesn't directly react, unless it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic compounds. Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds two O's, like Ozone in ozonolysis, but that's for breaking double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible elements in X. Since X has isotopes, perhaps it's a lighter element, like H (deuterium) or perhaps O, but O is less likely as a reagent.

Wait, the question mentions that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. One such reagent is NaOH, KOH, or perhaps something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but THF is more of a solvent.

Wait, another thought: X could be a halogen, like Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like sodium, potassium, etc.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Reacting with a strong acid (like H2SO4) would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. So Y could be H2SO4. The precipitate G would form if the product is insoluble, but Na2SO4 is soluble, so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a weaker acid, and the product is insoluble.

Wait, but the question says that when G is heated, B is released. So if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But in that case, B would be the oxide. The melting point of B is near 277 K, so if B is sodium oxide (Na2O), its melting point is around 1460°C, which doesn't fit. So perhaps G isn't a carbonate.

Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, the reaction produces a metal hydroxide as a precipitate if the hydroxide is insoluble. For example, if X is CuCO3, reacting with H2SO4 would produce CuSO4, which is soluble, but if the solution has excess acid, maybe it forms a copper hydroxide precipitate under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, producing H2S gas. But earlier I thought W was CO2.

Hmm. Let me think again. Gas W has same protons and neutrons. So CO2 fits.

So the reaction is X (a carbonate) + Y (an acid) → CO2 + H2O + a salt (precipitate G, which is the acid's salt if insoluble).

When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 4°C. So B must be a solid that's just starting to melt at around that temperature.

Wait, maybe B is a solid like ammonium nitrate, but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like camphor, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydrate. When heated, the hydrate loses water, and the anhydrous form (B) remains. For example, if G is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water and leave copper(II) sulfate anhydrous. But the melting point of the anhydrous form is around 1560°C, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate, which upon heating would lose water and become anhydrous sodium carbonate. But again, the melting point of sodium carbonate is much higher.

Wait, maybe B is water. But water's melting point is 273 K, which is 0°C. The question says 277 K, which is just a bit higher. So perhaps B is water, but how? If G is a hydrate, and heating it releases water, but then B would be the anhydrous salt, not the water. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a metal carbonate that, upon heating, releases CO2 and leaves a metal oxide. But then the oxide would be B, which doesn't have a melting point near 4°C.

Wait, another angle: Maybe B is a solid that is a byproduct, like an oxide that's solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. I'm not sure about any such oxide.

Wait, perhaps B is not a product from G's decomposition but is another product from the initial reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should think about X and its elements.

So, the product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's say X is a reagent that adds an O. For example, X could be a peroxide, like H2O2. When H2O2 reacts with a ketone, it can oxidize it. Let's say the ketone is acetone. The reaction could form something with two O's, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but I'm not sure how that would add O's.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a reagent that adds two O's, like Ozone. But Ozone is O3, which is a gas, and I'm not sure it's used as a reagent in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, which can oxidize a ketone to a carboxylic acid, adding an O. So the product would have two O's, which matches the condition.

So if X is KMnO4 (potassium permanganate), then Y could be something else, like H2SO4 (acid), and when they react, they produce MnO2, K2SO4, and other products. But I'm not sure how that ties into the precipitate G.

Wait, but in the initial reaction, X reacts with Y to produce CO2. If X is a carbonate, then Y is an acid, as we discussed earlier. But if X is KMnO4, then the gas W might be O2, but O2's molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So W would be O2, which has same protons and neutrons. That fits.

Wait, but the reaction of KMnO4 with an acid usually produces O2. For example, in an acidic solution, KMnO4 decomposes to MnO2, K2SO4, and O2. But then, W would be O2. So that fits.

So let's think: X is KMnO4, Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce O2, K2SO4, MnO2, and water. But where is the precipitate G coming from? If the reaction is in acidic conditions, MnO2 would precipitate if it's insoluble. MnO2 is a dark brown solid and is insoluble in water, so it would form as G. Then, when G (MnO2) is heated, perhaps it decomposes, but MnO2 is stable upon heating. So that doesn't fit, as B would not be released.

Alternatively, perhaps X is another compound.

Wait, another possibility: X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. The reaction produces CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a weak acid, the product may not be soluble. For example, if Y is acetic acid, then the reaction of Na2CO3 with acetic acid would produce sodium acetate, CO2, and water. Sodium acetate is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid but a base. Or maybe Y is a different liquid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, but that doesn't make much sense for a violent reaction.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to produce a precipitate. For example, X could be AgNO3, and Y could be NaCl solution, producing AgCl precipitate. But then W would be something else, perhaps HCl gas? No, because the reaction of AgNO3 with NaCl would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. No gas is released in that case.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about X again. The product of X and a keto acid has two O's. So perhaps X is a reagent that adds O's, like KMnO4. Let's say X is KMnO4, and it reacts with a ketone (like acetone) to form a carboxylic acid (like propanoic acid), which has two O's in the COOH group. So that fits.

In this scenario, X is KMnO4, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for oxidation. Now, what about the other parts of the problem?

The initial reaction: X (KMnO4?) reacts with Y (maybe an acid) violently to produce gas W. If KMnO4 reacts with an acid, it might produce O2. For example, in an acidic solution, KMnO4 decomposes to MnO2, K2SO4, and O2.

So the gas W would be O2. Each O2 molecule has 16 protons (8 *2) and 16 neutrons (8 *2), so that fits the condition of same number of protons and neutrons.

Then, the precipitate G would be MnO2, which is a dark brown solid. When G (MnO2) is heated, what happens? MnO2 is stable upon heating, so perhaps it doesn't release any gas. But the problem states that heating G releases B. So maybe MnO2 isn't the right choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is a different compound. Let me think again. Maybe X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, producing a metal sulfate as a precipitate if the metal's sulfate is insoluble. For example, if X is copper carbonate and Y is sulfuric acid, the reaction would produce copper sulfate, which is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid but another compound. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: Let's look at the options for the cumulative atomic masses.

The options are A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These numbers likely represent the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in X.

If X is KMnO4, its elements are K, Mn, and O. So the lightest element is K (mass ~39), Mn is about 55, O is 16. But wait, the question says to consider the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So the lightest would be K (39) and the heaviest would be Mn (55). Their sum is 39 +55=94, which isn't among the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think: the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X contains, say, Cl and another element, and their lightest and heaviest isotopes are considered.

Wait, let's think of another possibility for X. Suppose X is NaOH. Then the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (mass 1), heaviest is Na (23), sum is 24. Not matching the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbonate like Na2CO3. Elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. So option A is 35. But let me check if this fits.

So if X is Na2CO3, which reacts with an acid (Y) to produce CO2, water, and NaCl (if Y is HCl). But wait, if Y is HCl, then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

So W is CO2, which fits. The precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a weak acid, like acetic acid, then the reaction would produce sodium acetate, which is soluble, so again no precipitate. So perhaps X isn't Na2CO3.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Let's say X is NaOH. Reacting with an acid Y would produce water and a salt. If Y is a weak acid, the salt might precipitate. For example, NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a sulfide. Reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each S has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in S-32, but H has 1 and 0). So H2S molecule has 2 protons and 16*2=32 neutrons? No, that doesn't fit the same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, so W must be CO2. So X is a carbonate.

So let me think that X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2, and a precipitate G which is a salt. When G is heated, it releases B, which is a solid with melting point near 277 K.

So if G is a hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and water. But then, B would be the oxide, which has a high melting point, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide. When heated, it decomposes, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate which, upon heating, decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then, B would be the oxide, which has a high melting point.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible elements in X. If X is a carbonate, its elements are the metal (like Na, Mg, Ca), C, and O. The product with a keto acid has two O's. So perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, which has two O's in the COOH group.

So X must be a carbonate, and when it reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), perhaps in the presence of a strong acid, it can form a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about X being a metal. For example, X could be Mg, which reacts with an acid to produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition (same protons and neutrons). So that's not right.

Alternatively, X could be a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2, CaCl2, and H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a base. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a metal hydroxide, and X is a carbonate. The reaction would produce CO2 and a metal carbonate hydroxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing AgNO3, and X is NaCl. Then the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. But W would be HCl gas, which doesn't fit the same protons and neutrons.

Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck on the initial reaction. Let me try to focus on the elements in X and the sum of their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Looking at the options, 35 is likely the
