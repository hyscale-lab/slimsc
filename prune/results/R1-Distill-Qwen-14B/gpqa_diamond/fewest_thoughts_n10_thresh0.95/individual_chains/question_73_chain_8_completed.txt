Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second one has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because when objects are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't use the classical addition formula. I remember there's the velocity addition formula in special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait, but wait—since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by that factor. Let me get that straight.

Wait no, maybe it's the other way around. If object A is moving at u with respect to the lab frame and object B at v, then the speed of B as seen from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or wait, is it (u - v) over (1 - (u v)/c²)? No, wait, the formula is (v - u) divided by (1 - (uv)/(c²)) if v is the speed of B in the lab frame and u is A's speed. Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, let me think about the direction. Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds. But in relativity, the speeds don't simply subtract. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then as observed from A, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c² ). So denominator is (1 - 0.3) = 0.7. So the numerator is -0.1c, so the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is a positive quantity, the magnitude is about 0.14c. Wait, but the question asks for the relative speed, so perhaps it's the magnitude, or perhaps it's the sign depends on the direction. Wait, in the problem, both are moving in the same direction, so B is behind A. So from A's perspective, B is moving slower, so the relative speed is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? Wait, but wait, that's the classical approach. But in relativity, I can't do that. Oh wait, no, because in relativity, velocities don't just add or subtract like that.

Wait, okay, let me get this straight. The velocity of B as seen from A's frame (u') is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, v is B's speed in lab frame, u is A's speed in lab frame. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.14c, which is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. Looking at the options, option C has v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has same v_rel but E=5mc².

Wait, so I'm getting the relative speed as approximately 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so E = gamma * m c². But wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So for each, I need to calculate their energy and sum them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut moving at 0.5c: gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm. Do I consider the system as both astronauts together? Or does the system's energy relate to the center-of-momentum frame? No, I think in this case, the total energy is just the sum of each astronaut's individual energies. Because each is moving in the same direction, their kinetic energies add up. So yeah, summing the energies is correct.

So the answer should be option C: v_rel ≈0.14c, E≈5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is not simply the difference of their speeds. Instead, it is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since the question asks for the relative speed as a magnitude, we take:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
Mass = \( 2m \), speed = \( 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
Mass = \( 3m \), speed = \( 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:
