Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. 

Alright, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states involve both rotational and vibrational levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? And when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to a higher state.

Wait, so the molecule is initially in the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibrational level or maybe a rotational change? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, I think that in the ro-vibrational spectrum, the transitions are from the ground vibrational state to an excited vibrational state, but for each vibrational level, there are rotational changes too. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, so maybe it's the first excited vibrational state, and the rotational quantum number is at its lowest for that vibrational state.

But wait, the problem says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state. But in reality, the energy levels are quantized, and the transitions depend on the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the selection rule for vibrational transitions is Δv = ±1, and for rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can increase its vibrational state and change its rotational state.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy. So maybe it's moving from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which would be v=1, J=0? Or maybe J=1? Because for each vibrational state, the rotational levels start from J=0 and go up. Hmm, but the energy levels are such that the vibrational energy is much higher than rotational, so the lowest energy excited state would be the first vibrational level, regardless of rotation.

Wait, no. No, for a diatomic molecule, the ground state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be the first vibrational state (v=1), but with the lowest possible rotational state for that vibrational state. Or is it the next rotational state (J+1) in the same vibrational level?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The problem says, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state, and we need to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the first excited state, which is the next higher energy state. But what's the next higher energy state?

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule combine both vibrational and rotational energies. So the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ℏ ω, and the rotational energy is E_r = (J (J +1) ) ℏ c / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state would be the lowest energy state higher than E= (0 + 1/2) ℏ ω + 0. So the next possible states would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has lower energy?

Let me compute. Let's say the vibrational energy for v=1 is (1 + 1/2)ℏω = 3/2 ℏω. The rotational energy for J=1 is (1*2) * (ℏ²/(2I)) = 2 ℏ²/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I). So which is smaller, 3/2 ℏω or ℏ²/(I)? I think ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, and I can compute I.

Wait, I is the moment of inertia. I = μ r². μ is the reduced mass. Given Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu. So that's (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so r=2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20, so I ≈ 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, ℏ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. So let's compute the rotational energy for J=1. E_rot = [1*(1+1)] * ℏ²/(2I). Wait, no, the rotational energy is E_r = (J (J+1) ) * ℏ²/(2I). So for J=1, it's (2) * ℏ²/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I). So E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46) )

Let me compute that:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68)
Divided by 1.204e-46 is approximately 9.23e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy for v=1 is 3/2 ℏ ω. ℏ is ~1.0545718e-34 J s, ω is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vibrational = (3/2) * 1.0545718e-34 *4e14.

Let me compute that: 3/2 is 1.5. 1.5 * 1.0545718e-34 = approx 1.582e-34. Multiply by 4e14: 1.582e-34 *4e14 = 6.328e-20 J.

Comparing E_rot for J=1 (≈9.23e-23 J) and E_vibrational (≈6.328e-20 J). Oh, so 9.23e-23 is much smaller than 6.328e-20. So the next state with the lowest energy would be J=1 in the ground vibrational state (v=0), because that's lower than v=1, J=0.

Wait, but wait no. The total energy for v=0, J=1 is E = E_rot = ~9e-23 J. The total energy for v=1, J=0 is E = E_vibrational = ~6e-20 J. Which is higher, so the next state is v=0, J=1.

Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right because 9e-23 is lower than 6e-20. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be J=1, v=0. Because adding a photon to get to J=1 would require less energy than moving to v=1.

So in that case, the transition is from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1. But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy higher than the current state. Since E(v=0, J=1) is smaller than E(v=1, J=0), the transition would be to J=1.

But wait, wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0, but when we talk about rotation-vibration, the fundamental mode is the transition from v=0 to v=1, but that may not be the case here. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question is about the molecule being in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are either v=0, J=1, or v=1, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest E higher than E_initial.

So E_initial is (1/2)ℏω (v=0) plus 0 (J=0) → E_initial = (1/2) ℏ ω.

Now, E_next for J=1 is E_rot = (2) ℏ²/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I). Which is 9.23e-23 J.

E_next for v=1 is (3/2) ℏ ω ≈ 6.328e-20 J.

Which is higher, 9.23e-23 or 6.328e-20? Wait, 9.23e-23 is 0.923e-22, which is much smaller than 6.328e-20, which is 63.28e-20, which is 6.328e-20.

Wait, no, 9.23e-23 is 0.00923e-20, which is much smaller than 6.328e-20. So 9.23e-23 < 6.328e-20 → So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, same vibrational state. So the transition is from J=0 to J=1, same v=0.

So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between these two rotational states. Because the rotational energy is changing.

So the energy required is ΔE = E_final - E_initial.

E_final is for J=1, so E_rot = (2) * [ℏ²/(2I)] )= [ℏ² / I] * (2 / 2) → wait, no.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_r = (J (J+1) ) (ℏ²) / (2I). So for J=0, E_r0 = 0. For J=1, E_r1 = 2 * ℏ²/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I).

So ΔE = E_r1 - E_r0 = ℏ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be equal to ΔE, so E_photon = ℏ²/(I).

So the momentum of the photon. Because E = p c, where p is momentum, and c is speed of light.

Wait, no, for a photon, E = p c. So p = E / c.

So once I compute E_photon, I can find p.

So let me compute E_photon = ℏ²/(I).

Earlier, I computed I as approximately 1.204e-46 kg m².

ℏ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ℏ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So E_photon = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 → Let's compute that.

1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 = approximately 9.235e-23 J.

So p = E_photon / c = 9.235e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) → 3e8 is 3 * 1e8.

So 9.235e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.078e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.078e-31 N s, because Ns is kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are in that range. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

But wait, my calculation gives about 3e-31 Ns, which is much smaller than any of the options. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, let's go through the steps again. Maybe I messed up a calculation.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of I. Let me recalculate the moment of inertia I.

Given Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ is (20 *2) / (20+2) ) amu → 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx (1.8 * 1.66e-27) → about 2.988e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 2.988e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.988e-27 *4e-20 = 1.195e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

E_photon = ℏ²/(I) → (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.195e-46).

Let me compute (1.05457e-34)^2 → 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.195e-46 → 1.112e-68 / 1.195e-46 ≈ 9.305e-23 J.

So E_photon = ~9.3e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.3e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) → 3.1e-31 kg m/s → which is 3.1e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but that's 1000 times larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the next state. Maybe the next state is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the model considered is the non-rigid rotor, which includes the effect of bond vibrations on the moment of inertia. Wait, but the problem says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor? Or is it the rigid rotor model?

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also known as the non-rigid rotor model. In the non-rigid rotor, the bond length is not fixed, and the moment of inertia can vary with the vibrational state. But for this problem, perhaps it's a simple rigid rotor plus harmonic oscillator model.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the next state. Maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But the problem says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which is lower in energy: v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0.

Earlier, I calculated that E(v=0, J=1) is ~9.23e-23 J, and E(v=1, J=0) is ~6.32e-20 J. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, no, that can't be right. Because 9e-23 is way less than 6e-20, but that would mean that v=0, J=1 is lower in energy than v=1, J=0. So the next state would be the one with lower energy higher than E_initial.

Wait, but the current state is E_initial = (1/2) ℏ ω.

So E_next should be the state where E is just higher than E_initial.

So E(v=0, J=1) is 9e-23 J, and E(v=1, J=0) is 6.3e-20 J. But E_initial is (1/2)ℏ ω = 0.5 * 1.05e-34 *4e14 ≈ 2.1e-20 J.

Wait, no. Wait, E_initial is (1/2) ℏ ω. Let me compute that.

ℏ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So (1/2) * 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 * 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = (0.5 *4) = 2 → 2 * 1.05457e-34 *1e14 → 2.10914e-20 J.

So E_initial is 2.109e-20 J.

E for v=0, J=1 is 9.23e-23 J, which is much lower than E_initial. That can't be right. Because E_initial is already 2.1e-20 J, and E_next must be higher than that. So moving to J=1 would lead to a lower energy state. That can't be, because E_initial is the ground state.

Wait, this suggests that I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, let's recalculate E_rot for J=1.

E_rot = (J (J+1)) * (ℏ²) / (2I).

So for J=1, E_rot = 2 * ℏ²/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I).

I is 1.195e-46 kg m².

So ℏ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.195e-46 = approximately 9.305e-23 J.

Which is way smaller than E_initial (2.1e-20 J). So that can't be. Because that would imply the molecule can transition to a state with lower energy upon absorbing a photon, which is impossible because photons are absorbed to increase energy.

Ah, I think I see my mistake. Oh wait, no. No, the molecule is in the ground state. The next state must have higher energy. So, perhaps the next state is v=1, J=0. Because the rotational state J=1 would have energy lower than E_initial.

Wait, no. Because the rotational energy for J=1 is 9e-23 J, which is less than E_initial (2.1e-20 J). So the molecule cannot transition to J=1 because that would be a lower energy state. That can't be, as that would require a photon with negative energy, which doesn't exist.

So perhaps the selection rule is that for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1, and for rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. But if the vibrational state is at v=0, perhaps the next transition is to v=1, regardless of J.

Wait, but the problem states the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest state. So the next state must have a higher energy. So maybe the next state is v=1, J=0.

Because in that case, the energy is (3/2) ℏ ω = 3/2 *1.05e-34 *4e14 → Let me compute that.

3/2 is 1.5, so 1.5 * 1.05e-34 = 1.575e-34. Multiply by 4e14 → 6.3e-20 J.

So the energy difference is 6.3e-20 J - 2.1e-20 J = 4.2e-20 J.

So the photon's energy must be 4.2e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E / c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So that would be the answer.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state: \( v = 0 \) (ground vibrational state) and \( J = 0 \) (ground rotational state). The total energy of the molecule is given by:

\[
E = E_{\text{vibrational}} + E_{\text{rotational}}
\]

### Step 1: Energy of the Initial State
The vibrational energy for \( v = 0 \) is:

\[
E_{\text{vibrational}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The rotational energy for \( J = 0 \) is:

\[
E_{\text{rotational}} = 0
\]

Thus, the total energy of the initial state is:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

### Step 2: Energy of the Next State
The next state with the lowest possible energy must have a higher energy than \( E_{\text{initial}} \). The two possible transitions are:
1. \( v = 0, J = 1 \): This involves a rotational transition.
2. \( v = 1, J = 0 \): This involves a vibrational transition.

#### Rotational Transition (\( v = 0, J = 1 \))
The rotational energy for \( J = 1 \) is:

\[
E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{J (J + 1) \hbar^2}{2I}
\]

For \( J = 1 \):

\[
E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{2 \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]

The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated using the reduced mass \( \mu \) and the bond length \( r \):

\[
I = \mu r^2
\]

The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:

\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
\]

Given \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), and \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \):

\[
\mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
\]

\[
\mu = 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Thus:

\[
I = (3.01 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2
\]

The rotational energy for \( J = 1 \) is:

\[
E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
\]

Using \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \):

\[
E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

#### Vibrational Transition (\( v = 1, J = 0 \))
The vibrational energy for \( v = 1 \) is:

\[
E_{\text{vibrational}} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

Using \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):

\[
E_{\text{vibrational}} = \frac{3}{2} (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 6.33 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing Energies
The energy of the initial state is:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega = \frac{1}{2} (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.11 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

The energy of \( v = 0, J = 1 \) is \( 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is lower than \( E_{\text{initial}} \), so this cannot be the next state. The energy of \( v = 1, J = 0 \) is \( 6.33 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), which is higher than \( E_{\text{initial}} \). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is \( v = 1, J = 0 \).

### Step 4: Energy of the Photon
The energy difference between \( E_{\text{initial}} \) and \( E_{\text{next}} \) is:

\[
\Delta E = E_{\text{next}} - E_{\text{initial}} = 6.33 \times 10^{-20} - 2.11 \times 10^{-20} = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]

The energy of the photon must match this difference. The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]

Using \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
p = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Matching with Options
The closest option to \( 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s} \) is:

**D) \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s} \)**

Answer: D
