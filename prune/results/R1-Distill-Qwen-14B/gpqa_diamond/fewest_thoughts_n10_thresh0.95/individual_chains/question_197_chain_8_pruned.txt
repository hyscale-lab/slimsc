Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a final product after a reaction, given the IR and NMR spectra of the starting compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) reaction for something specific. Oh right, it's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Oh, wait, no, the other reaction. Oh, right, when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and you use red phosphorus with HI, that's usually theWolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, that's for removing carbonyl groups by converting them into methylene groups, but I'm not sure. Or wait, no, maybe it's the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction? No, that's for elimination. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, the specific reaction is the reduction of esters or ketones. Wait, no. Oh, wait, when you have a ketone and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's the reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Or is it something else? Alternatively, I think that the combination of HI and red phosphorus is used in the presence of a carbonyl group to do a specific type of elimination. Or wait, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. No, wait, wait, another thought: when you have a ketone, like an aromatic ketone, and you use a hydride source like NaBH4, you get the alcohol. But red phosphorus with HI is different. Oh wait, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used for the dehydrohalogenation, like the formation of alkenes via elimination. Or maybe it's for the elimination of HX. Wait, perhaps in the presence of a carbonyl group, the HI adds across the carbonyl, and then elimination occurs. Let me think: for example, if you have a ketone and you add HI, it might form a dihalide through a conjugate addition, but I'm not exactly clear. Alternatively, I think that the reaction of a carbonyl with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of an alkane. Wait, I might be mixing up the reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction where the carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group. Oh, that's theWolff-Kishner reaction. But wait, Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine), heat, and strong base like KOH or NaOH. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, if compound X has a ketone group, after Clemmensen it would become a CH2 group. But the question here mentions red phosphorus and HI, which I think is the Hagemann reaction. Oh wait, no. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent? No, Grignard reagents are made with Mg and diethyl ether, I think. So maybe not. Let me think again. So, the starting material is compound X, which has IR and NMR data. I should analyze that data to figure out what X is, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So let's start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1.

The 3400–2500 cm-1 region often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the NMR doesn't show any signals that would suggest amines, probably an O-H stretch. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is typical for an ester or a ketone. The 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching. So the molecule has aromatic rings and a carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which fits here. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative?

Wait, but let's check all the signals.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's in the aromatic region. A doublet, indicating coupling with one adjacent proton. So perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two protons each in the doublets.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, same as above. So maybe a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para), where each substituent is in the para position. So, for example, a substituent in position 4 and another in position 1, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, it's a benzene ring with four positions substituted? No, no, wait, it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each causing two protons to be in doublets. So perhaps it's a meta substitution, but more likely, it's an ortho or para substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents that each have two protons in the ring as doublets.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each having a substituent that splits the aromatic protons. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other, causing each set of two protons to be doublets. Alternatively, perhaps a structure like para-substituted benzene with another group attached. Hmm.

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe from a CH group next to another CH group or something similar.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. Like a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is adjacent to another CH2 or CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is typical for a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a phenyl group attached to a carbon chain, ending with a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1. For a ketone, that's about 1700-1750. Wait, no, wait, for a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750 cm-1, and for an ester, it's around 1730-1750 cm-1, but can vary. So 1720 could be a ketone or ester, but I think more likely a ketone.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is more like a carboxylic acid. Because ketones don't have protons in that region. Wait, unless it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an enol form. But that usually doesn't give a strong peak around 10.5. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But 10.5 is a bit higher. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Let me consider that.

So, the NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So compound X has a -COOH group.

Looking back at the IR, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3300 cm-1 (broad), which aligns with the 3400-2500 region. The carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes can be a bit higher or lower. So 1720 would fit.

So, if X is a benzoic acid derivative, let's think about the substituents. The aromatic region in NMR has two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents on carbon 4 and another group. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted benzene, but that would typically give more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that each substituent causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, and each has an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the aromatic protons would be deshielded and split into doublets.

If the benzene ring has a substituent at para position which is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an ester), then the adjacent protons would each be next to each substituent. Wait, but the NMR shows 8.0 and 7.2 ppm for the aromatic protons. Let me think about substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. For example, if the structure is 4-phenylbutanoyl or something else. Wait, perhaps it's something like 4-ethylbenzoyl chloride? No, that's not a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let me think: if the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4. Then, the aromatic protons would be in the positions 2,3,5,6. For such a structure, the protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded. But in the NMR, the two doublets each integrate to 2H, so perhaps they're in a para-substituted ring.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) for the aromatic region. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggests a para-disubstituted benzene ring, where each substituent is attached to the ring, causing the adjacent protons to be split into doublets. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Alternatively, substituents at positions 1 and 4 (but that would be para to each other), each having a substituent that causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two in the para positions, each of which is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the adjacent protons to deshield and split into doublets.

But the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and another group like an ethyl chain.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group, perhaps next to a CH.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, probably as a branch.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH2CH(CH3)2) attached to a benzene ring. Wait, no, the 1.7 is m 2H, which could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH.

Wait, maybe it's a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-..., but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 3-phenylpropanoic acid. But the substituents don't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let me think: benzene ring with -COOH at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4. The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,3,5,6. But how would the NMR look? For 4-ethylbenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the ethyl group.

Wait, but in such a scenario, the protons ortho to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The protons meta to the ethyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded.

So, in the NMR, the two doublets could come from these two sets of protons. Let's say the more deshielded protons (adjacent to COOH) are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and the other set at 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between adjacent protons would lead to doublets for each pair.

That makes sense. So the structure would be 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let me check the other NMR signals.

4-ethylbenzoic acid would have the COOH group, so the 10.5 ppm peak would be the O-H. The aromatic protons would be as described. Now, what about the other signals?

Looking at the NMR data, there are signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

Wait, 4-ethylbenzoic acid would have a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, wait, the ethyl group is attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent is an ethyl group, but that's only CH2CH3. But the NMR shows more complex signals, like a CH group and so on.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is not an ethyl group. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to another CH. The
