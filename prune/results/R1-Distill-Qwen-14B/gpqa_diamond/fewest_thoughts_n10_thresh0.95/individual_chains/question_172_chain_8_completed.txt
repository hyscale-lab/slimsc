Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no—that's plants. Oh right, it's the outer layer where we can see the light. So the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars and their energy levels.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium. So each small region of the photosphere is in thermal equilibrium, allowing us to use things like the Boltzmann distribution.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution equation, which relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the degeneracy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as E_i - E_j = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. We're told that the population for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. I think we can assume that the degeneracy factors g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, since it's the same element in the same energy levels, so g_i/g_j would cancel out. So the equation simplifies to (n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The problem says the excitation is twice as excited in star_1. So n1 is the population in the excited state for star_1, and n2 for star_2. But wait, wait, no—the energy levels are in the same state for each star. So for a given star, the excited state is a certain energy level. So for star_1, the population in that level is n1, and for star_2 it's n2.

So n1 = 2 * n2.

Putting into the equation: (n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) for star_1 and exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) for star_2? Or wait, no, because each star has its own temperature. Wait, hold on. Wait, for each star, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is determined by their temperature. So for star_1, the ratio of n1 to n_ground (let's say E_j is the ground state) would be given by the equation. But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the excited states to some other state? Or wait, maybe the ratio is relative to the same other state for both stars.

Wait, perhaps I should model it this way. Let’s denote for each star, the lower energy level as E1 and the higher as E2. Then for each star, the population ratio of E2 to E1 is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

But in the problem statement, it's about the excitation in a specific energy level. Wait, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Ah, I think the correct way to interpret that is that the number of iron atoms in a certain excited state (say, level i) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2. So for each star, the ratio of n_i to another state (like the ground state) would be governed by their respective temperatures.

Wait, but to compare n1_i and n2_i, perhaps we can write the ratio as (n1_i / n1_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly (n2_i / n2_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But then the problem is that n1_ground and n2_ground are different because the total number of atoms is different, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the same state in each star.

Wait, no, perhaps the ratio is relative to the same lower energy level in both stars. So for each star, the ratio of n_i (excited) to n_j (ground) is given by exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2, n2_i / n2_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that n1_i = 2 * n2_i. So let's write that:

n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But n1_j is the population of the ground state in star_1, and n2_j in star_2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if we can directly relate n1_i and n2_i without knowing their respective ground states. Hmm, perhaps it's better to assume that we can take the ratio of the ratios. So (n1_i / n1_j) / (n2_i / n2_j) ) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Which simplifies to (n1_i /n2_i) * (n2_j / n1_j) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But without knowing the relationship between n1_j and n2_j, it's tricky. Maybe the problem is assuming that the total number of iron atoms is the same in both stars, which isn't stated, so perhaps that's an incorrect assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the excited to ground state within each star, and in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated as in star_2. But that would require knowing more about the ground state.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let's think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. The excitation depends on the temperature. So for the same energy difference, the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state is higher in the hotter star.

So if star_1 is hotter than star_2, then the fraction of excited atoms in star_1 would be higher. Since n1_i is twice n2_i, perhaps T1 is higher than T2. But how to relate the temperatures?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations is given by n1_i / n2_i = [T2 / T1] or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each star's population ratio is given by n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, n1_i/n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, n2_i/n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But without knowing n1_j and n2_j, maybe we can take the ratio of the two populations.

So n1_i / n2_i = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] * (n2_j / n1_j )

Wait, but unless n1_j and n2_j are the same, we can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same ground state, so that n1_j = n2_j, which would allow us to eliminate that term.

But I don't think the problem states that. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the effective temperatures. The options involve ln(2), so perhaps the ratio is 2, which would relate to ln(2) when exponentials are involved.

Wait, if n1_i = 2 * n2_i, and each n_i is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), then 2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Because for each star, n_i is proportional to the exponential. So the ratio would be:

n1_i / n2_i = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So 2 = exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Rearranging:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (k ln 2 ) / ΔE

But let's compute that ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and k is the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, that's exactly the same number. So ΔE = k. Because 1.38e-23 J is k.

So (ΔE)/(k) = 1.

So ln(2) = (1) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So ln(2) = (1/T2) - (1/T1 )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So option D is the correct equation.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. For a given energy difference \( \Delta E \), the ratio of the populations of atoms in an excited state to a ground state is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the populations of the excited state are related as \( n_{1,i} = 2 \, n_{2,i} \). Assuming the Boltzmann factor applies to each star, the ratio of the populations can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{2,i}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{2,i}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Given \( n_{1,i} = 2 \, n_{2,i} \), we substitute \( 2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) \). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of \( k \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \), and the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the final equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
