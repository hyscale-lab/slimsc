Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the RV method. Hmm, the radial velocity method, right? I remember that's when you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both stars have the same mass, M, and the planets have similar masses, m. The planets are in circular orbits.

They detected the planets via RV method. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's.

Wait, so I need to find (Period2)/(Period1). Or wait, no—if planet #2's period is longer, then the ratio would be greater than one. Let me read the question again. It says, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So we're looking for Period2 divided by Period1.

I think the key here is understanding how the RV method relates the spectral shift to orbital parameters. From what I remember, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is related to the planet's orbital motion. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Another approach: The semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, and since the orbits are circular (so e=0), perhaps the formula simplifies. Let me think about the formula again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, while the Sun is 333,000 Earth masses), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So sin i is approximately 1 for edge-on orbits, which is the best case scenario. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but both planets have the same mass as Neptune, and the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So for both planets, M_planet and M_star are the same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, that's a key point. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me double-check. Because if K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^(3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1, right? Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

Wait, wait, I think I got the proportionality wrong. Let's think again. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

But again, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1. So:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p for both planets is same, M_star is same for both stars. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, and K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1, because 1/P2^(1/3) is bigger than 1/P1^(1/3) only if P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, but in the question, the shift for planet #2 is larger (7 milliangstrom) than planet #1 (5). So K2 is greater than K1. So according to K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because a larger velocity shift would imply a more massive planet or a closer orbit. But since the planets have the same mass, perhaps a closer orbit would cause a larger velocity shift. Because if the planet is closer, the star's velocity would be higher due to the tighter orbit. Alternatively, a larger semi-major axis (longer period) would result in a lower velocity shift.

Wait, yes, because the velocity of the star is determined by the planet's orbital speed. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Again, M_p << M_star, so:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me get this right. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, and K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, where C is a constant.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me think it through.

Suppose K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = C * (1/P1)^(1/3)
K2 = C * (1/P2)^(1/3)
So K2/K1 = (1/P2)^(1/3) / (1/P1)^(1/3) ) =
