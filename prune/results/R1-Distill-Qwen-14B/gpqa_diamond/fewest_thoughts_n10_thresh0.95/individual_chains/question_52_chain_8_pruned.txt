Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms in energy levels depends on the temperature. Oh right, it's about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The star's initial parameters are a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, does that mean the spots are making the star cooler overall? Or does it have to do with the emission we observe?

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, right? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower.

I remember the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant. So the ratio depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the near ultraviolet, I think. So the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Let me calculate ΔE first. But wait, maybe I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out in the ratio. Hmm, perhaps I can find the ratio of the ratios (n1/n2) at the two different temperatures.

Wait, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. But wait, the spots are dark, so they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire surface is at 5500 K on average, or is it that part of the surface is cooler and part is at 6000 K? Hmm, the problem says the overall photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K. So the effective temperature is that of a blackbody with 40% of the surface at a lower temperature and 60% at 6000 K. Wait, that's a bit more complicated. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they just want me to compare the two temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio depends on the temperature. Let me think about this.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) * (g1/g2). Or wait, from Boltzmann, the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So with spots, n1/n2 is lower than without spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than when there are spots.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Let me write down the two ratios:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Without spots: T1 = 6000 K.

With spots: T2 = 5500 K.

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Wait, the (g1/g2) terms cancel out because both ratios have the same g1 and g2. So the factor becomes exp( ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So the factor is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

What is ΔE? Let me compute it. Using E = hc/λ.

Given λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, for the Boltzmann equation, we're looking at the energy difference per unit of temperature. So ΔE/(k) would be in terms of Kelvin, perhaps.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K ≈ 10^5 K.

Wait, that's a huge number. So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 10^5 K.

So now, let's plug into the exponent:

(ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 1e5 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1/6000 is about 0.00016667, and 1/5500 is about 0.00018182. But wait, no, wait, 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000. So wait, 1/5500 is approximately 0.00018182.

So (1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative, because 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000. So the exponent becomes (1e5) * (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) = 1e5 * (-0.00001515) = approximately -1.515.

So the exponent is about -1.515.

So the factor is exp(-1.515) ≈ what? Hmm, e^1.5 is about 4.48. So e^-1.5 is about 0.22. But 1.515 is a bit more than 1.5. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817. So e^-1.5 ≈ 0.2231.

But 1.515 is 1.5 + 0.015. So e^1.515 = e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.549. So e^-1.515 ≈ 1/4.549 ≈ 0.2198.

So the factor is approximately 0.22. But wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2 )) ) ≈ 0.22. So this means the ratio without spots is about 0.22 times the ratio when there are spots. Wait, no, let me double-check.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted. So if the factor is 0.22, that would mean that when the star has no spots, the ratio is 0.22 times when it has spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is lower when spotted, which would mean that the ratio without spots is higher than when spotted. So our calculation gives that the ratio without spots is 0.22 times the ratio when spotted. Wait, but that would mean that when not spotted, the ratio is lower, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let me retrace my steps.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So n1/n2_spotted < n1/n2_unspotted. So the ratio without spots is higher.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted = exp( [ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ] )

Wait, but ΔE is E2 - E1. Oh wait, wait, no: in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is -(E2 - E1)/(k T). So when E2 > E1,
