Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and not be resolvable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or perhaps the average? Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Let me compute the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But wait, we might need to convert units to electron volts because the options are in eV.

Wait, another approach: since the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), where τ is the lifetime, so for each state, we can compute ΔE.

Let me compute for each:

For the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2*τ1).

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2*τ2).

Which one of these would be larger? Since τ2 is larger than τ1, 1e-8 > 1e-9, so 1/τ2 is smaller than 1/tau1. So ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. That makes sense because a longer lifetime means a smaller uncertainty in energy.

So the uncertainty from the first state is bigger. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the sum would be the largest uncertainty, which is ΔE1?

Wait, no, the sum of the two uncertainties would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because each energy level contributes its own uncertainty. So if the energy difference is greater than that sum, then they can be distinguished.

So let's compute the uncertainties. Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, calculate ħ in eV·s. I know that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.291e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

So the sum of these uncertainties is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Wait, but sometimes the energy difference only needs to be greater than the largest uncertainty. Since ΔE1 is bigger, maybe the energy difference just needs to be bigger than that. But the question is about being clearly resolved, so perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C:1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 3.6e-7.

Option D:1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.01e-6. Also smaller than 3.6e-7.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. The larger the sum, the more separated the states are.

Wait, but in reality, when measuring energy levels, the uncertainty comes from each state. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So for example, if E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, the energy difference between them must be at least ΔE1 + ΔE2 to be resolvable.

So the minimum ΔE is approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Now looking at the options, which option is larger than 3.62e-7 eV?

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is way bigger than 3.62e-7 eV (which is about 0.362e-6 eV). So option C is much larger than the required sum.

Alternatively, checking the other options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → smaller than 0.362e-6.

Option B: 1e-11 → 0.000001e-6 → way too small.

Option D:1e-8 → 0.01e-6 → 0.01e-6 is less than 0.362e-6. So option D is also too small.

So the only option that is larger than the required 3.62e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but is there a possibility that only the larger uncertainty matters? Let me think again. Suppose the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the lower energy state, but less than the sum.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties of each state. Because if the energy difference is less than the uncertainty of one of the states, then the lines could overlap.

But wait, the states are E1 and E2. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. The uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV, and for E2 is ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, which is 3.62e-7 eV. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two energy levels might not be resolvable; their energy ranges would overlap.

So the energy difference must be larger than 3.62e-7 eV for them to be clearly distinguished. Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16/(2e-9) → 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 → 3.291e-7 eV.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 → 3.291e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be larger than 3.619e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV which is 100e-6 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. Wait, wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4. 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6. 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is way bigger than 0.36e-6.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. Therefore, it's a viable option.

What about if the energy difference is 1e-4, which is way higher than needed, but that's okay because it's the only option that's high enough.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau},
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. The Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Compute the uncertainties for each state
- For the first state (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state (\( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 100 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
