Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states of molecules.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given with different p values.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. So the molecule can change either its vibrational state or its rotational state, or both. But for the minimal energy change, probably only one of them changes.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think that means the smallest possible energy jump. Because the next state could be either a higher rotational state or a vibrational state, but which requires less energy?

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be either a higher rotational state (like J=1) or a higher vibrational state (like v=1).

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the non-rigid rotor, it's a bit more complex, but I think in this problem, we might approximate it as a rigid rotor since the question doesn't specify otherwise.

For the vibrational energy, the harmonic oscillator model gives E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. The fundamental state is v=0. The next vibrational state would be v=1, which requires a photon with energy hν. Alternatively, for rotation, the next state would be J=1, requiring a photon with energy proportional to B.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy: rotating from J=0 to J=1, or vibrating from v=0 to v=1?

Let me compute both and see which is smaller.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The frequency ν is given as 4e14 rad/s. Wait, but in the formula, it's angular frequency ω, and ν (frequency) is ω/(2π). Wait, no, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (v + 1/2) h ω, where ω is the angular frequency. So the energy difference ΔE_vib between v=0 and v=1 is hω (since 1/2 hω is the zero-point energy, and you add another hω for v=1).

So ΔE_vib = hω.

Then, the rotational energy. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ r², and μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So let's compute μ.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = (40)/(22) amu = (20/11) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ approx 2.99e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 1.818 * 1.66 = about 3.000, so 3e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 12e-47 kg m².

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2e-10 squared is 4e-20. Multiply by 3e-27 kg: 3e-27 *4e-20 = 12e-47 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Then, B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (ħ²) / (2I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2e-46 )

Calculating numerator: (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2e-46 = 2.4e-46.

So B = 1.1e-68 / 2.4e-46 ≈ (1.1/2.4) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.458e-22 ≈ 4.58e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait: 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22. So 1.1e-68 / 2.4e-46 = (1.1/2.4) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.458e-22 = 4.58e-23 J.

But wait, B is in J·s²/m²? Or is it in cm⁻¹? Wait, no, B is the rotational constant in energy units (J), but in spectroscopy, B is sometimes given in terms of cm⁻¹, but in this case, we're using it for energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy required to change rotational state. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), so from J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by B [2 - 0] = 2B.

So the energy difference for rotation is 2B.

So comparing ΔE_vib = h ω and ΔE_rot = 2B.

Which is larger? Let's compute both.

First, h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

ΔE_vib = h ω = 6.
