Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, first, I think I need to figure out their relative speed as observed by one astronaut. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, but under special relativity, it's not that straightforward. Oh right, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, right. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, I need to double-check. Oh wait, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u and v are velocities. So let's see, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait wait, wait. No, wait a second. The question is about their relative speed. So let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem states that both are moving in the positive x direction, but the problem is asking for their relative speed. So I need to find the speed of one relative to the other.

Wait, so if I'm in A's frame (moving at 0.6c), then B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So in my frame, I'm stationary, and B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c? No, wait, no, that can't be right because velocities don't simply subtract in relativity. So I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall the formula. The relative velocity u' (of B in A's frame) is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is B's velocity in the lab frame, and v is A's velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait a second. No, actually, in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So when you're in A's frame, which is moving at v =0.6c relative to the lab, then the speed of B is (u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)) ), where u is B's speed in the lab frame, which is 0.5c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c² )

Calculating numerator: 0.5 -0.6 = -0.1 c. Denominator: 1 - ( (0.3 c²) )/c² ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = -0.142857 c, approximately. Wait, but the question is about the relative speed, which is the magnitude. So the relative speed is about 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c, which is one of the options. So that would correspond to options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. So I need to calculate the relativistic energies of both astronauts and add them up.

The total energy E is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. The energy of each is gamma * m c². So for each, I need to compute gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) =1/0.8=1.25.

So energy E1= gamma * m_rest * c². But wait, the mass given is 2m and 3m. So E1 = gamma_1 * 2m c²=1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=approx 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma_2 * 3m c² =1.1547 *3 m c²= approximately 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E= E1 + E2=2.5 +3.4641=5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

That matches. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as observed by the other is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame) and \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### Energy of Astronaut B
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 = 3.4641m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
