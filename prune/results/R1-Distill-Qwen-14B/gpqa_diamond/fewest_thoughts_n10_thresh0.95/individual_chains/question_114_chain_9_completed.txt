Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Alright, let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one has a carbonyl group, so the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxy group. Oh, right! So maybe it's an addition followed by something else. Oh, wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it gives a cyanohydrin. But in this case, it's NaCN, which I think is providing CN- in a basic solution. Or maybe it's in an acidic solution?

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the product structure. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure-wise, that's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait no, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, right. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, maybe I should draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, butane has four carbons, so the nitrile is on C1, then C2 is the hydroxy and methyl. Let me count: the parent chain is butane, so four carbons. The nitrile is on C1 (since butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN?), but the product is butan-2-one reacting to form a cyanohydrin.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl. The reaction is:

RCO(R') + HCN → RC(OH)(R')R'' where R'' is the cyanide part. Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached.

So in this case, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product has four carbons. Wait, but the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, three carbons. So adding CN would make it four. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butanenitrile is four carbons, nitrile on C4. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but that would be five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be 3-pentanenitrol or something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's think about the reaction type.

The reaction is between a ketone and NaCN. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. But the product has both an alcohol and a nitrile group. Oh! So it's a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction is when a ketone reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. But in this case, it's NaCN, which is a source of CN- in a solution. So what conditions are needed?

Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Wait, but I think HCN is a weak acid, so maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst. But NaCN is a strong base, so perhaps when it's in an acidic solution. Or maybe when a base is present, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the cyanohydrin reaction usually involves adding HCN to a ketone. The reaction is catalyzed by an acid. For example, HCN plus ketone in H2SO4 or something. But in this problem, the reagent is NaCN and A. So perhaps A is the acid that protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

So the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product (cyanohydrin). So A is probably an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or something else. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B says A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH. Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl. Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that would make sense as an acid catalyst for the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- in a solution. But if the solution is acidic, CN- can't be present because it would be protonated to HCN. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in acidic conditions, CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. So if the solution is acidic, wouldn't the CN- not be available for the reaction?

Wait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps the first reaction is done under basic conditions. But wait, the product has a hydroxyl group. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Oh, no, that's not likely because ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the second reaction. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (which is H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. So the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, no, the reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. Because in the question, the second reaction is written as:

[compound] + B (H2O) → [another compound]

So B is the reagent, and the reaction is carried out in water. So what reagent in water would oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

Oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like O3, but more commonly KMnO4 or similar.

Wait, but the options for B are either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. Hmm, perhaps B is an acid catalyst, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group under certain conditions.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under specific conditions. Hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires either strong acid or strong base, and heat. For example, in acidic conditions with H2O and HgSO4 as a catalyst, or in basic conditions with NaOH and heat.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the structure is R-C(OH)-CN, and the product is R-C(OH)-COOH. So the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

So the transformation is CN → COOH. That's an oxidation. So what reagents can oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

In acidic conditions, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, another possibility is treatment with a strong acid and heat. But in the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, NaHSO3, etc.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile. Wait, but I thought nitrile hydrolysis typically requires more than just HCl. Oh, wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. Let me think: nitrile → amide → hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe B is HCl and the reaction involves hydrochloric acid acting as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: If the reagent is HCl (B = HCl), perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. So the nitrile group (CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (COOH) under acidic conditions. Is that possible?

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions usually gives a carboxylic acid. For example, when a nitrile is treated with concentrated H2SO4 and HgSO4, it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under strong acidic conditions, maybe in presence of HCl and water, the nitrile could hydrolyze.

Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is first converted to an imidamide or something else, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the structure is R-C(OH)-CN. So when the nitrile is oxidized, it becomes R-C(OH)-COOH.

Wait, oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires a strong oxidizing agent. So KMnO4 under acidic conditions is a common reagent. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst, maybe?

But the options don't include KMnO4. So perhaps B is an acid, like HCl or acetic acid, which acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me think about the possible reactions.

In the first reaction, the reagent A is used in the formation of the cyanohydrin. Since the product is a cyanohydrin, the reaction is likely acid-catalyzed. So A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the reagent B is used in the presence of water to convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So if B is HCl (option A and C), then perhaps it's acting as an acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

But wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid usually needs a strong acid and a catalyst. HCl is a strong acid, but I'm not sure if it's enough on its own. Alternatively, perhaps B is an acid, like acetic acid (option B and D), which would provide the acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH when A is H3O+ (options A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. For the second reaction, the reagent B is in H2O. So the reaction is in aqueous solution, with B as the reagent. So B could be an acid (like HCl) or another reagent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group under acidic conditions. So B is an acid, which provides the H+ for the reaction. So if B is HCl, then it's a strong acid.

But wait, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (i.e., an acidic solution), then the product would be the correct cyanohydrin. So looking back, the first reaction uses NaCN and reagent A.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is not under acidic conditions but under basic conditions. Because NaCN in a basic solution would provide CN- as a nucleophile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So in basic conditions, it's less reactive towards nucleophilic attack because the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated, making the carbonyl less electrophilic. Hmm, but in the presence of a strong base, maybe the CN- would attack the carbonyl.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the reaction is not possible because the CN- is a weak base and would not stay in solution. Or maybe the base deprotonates the ketone, making it more reactive.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is done in a basic solution, using NaOH as a base, but that's not one of the options for A. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is in the presence of a strong acid, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

Wait, but if the solution is acidic, CN- would protonate to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. So that would make the reaction less likely. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction mechanism. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed addition of HCN, which then loses HCN and forms the cyanohydrin. Wait, no, that doesn't explain it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is Claisen or some other condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is using NaHSO3 as the reagent A. Wait, what does NaHSO3 do in such reactions?

Wait, HSO3^- is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Or perhaps in solution, it's a weak acid. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It can act as a reducing agent, or in some cases, as a source of H+.

Alternatively, maybe in the first reaction, NaHSO3 is used as a catalyst. Wait, but I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, if the reagent A is H3O+, that would imply an acidic solution, which would protonate the ketone, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

But wait, if it's acidic, CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. That would decrease the reaction rate, making it less likely. So maybe A is a base, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the first reaction. Let me think again. Could the first reaction be an example of a condensation reaction, like the formation of a cyanohydrin via acid catalysis?

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN and an acid catalyst, like sulfuric acid. So in this case, NaCN would provide CN- in a solution, but in the presence of H3O+ as a catalyst.

Wait, but if NaCN is in an acidic solution, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, making it a better nucleophile? Or worse, since HCN is a weaker base than CN-.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the standard reaction.

The cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then, the CN- (from HCN) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the proton is transferred, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but NaCN in an acidic solution would have CN- reacting with H+ to form HCN. So perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward. Unless the solution is not highly acidic, or perhaps the reaction is done under specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reagent is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, maybe it's acting as a catalyst in some way.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try to think about the second reaction again.

The second reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reagent is B in the presence of H2O.

If B is HCl (option A and C), then perhaps it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Or, if B is CH3COOH (options B and D), then it's also an acidic environment.

But the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the nitrile is being oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps it's hydrolyzed under strong acidic conditions. Let me recall: the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic conditions with H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts to form carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions with aqueous NaOH and heat, you get amides or acids.

Wait, perhaps B is HCl, which is a strong acid, and in the presence of water, it facilitates the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid. So HCl (B) is the reagent, and the reaction is in H2O.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's try to see which option makes sense.

If the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is an acid catalyst, and the second reaction uses HCl as B, which provides the acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid, then option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) would be correct.

Alternatively, if the second reaction uses acetic acid (CH3COOH) as B, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, but I'm not sure if it's strong enough. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so maybe it's not sufficient. HCl is a strong acid, so perhaps it's better for the hydrolysis.

So for the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → product. So the acid (H3O+) is the catalyst.

In the second reaction: the nitrile is treated with HCl (a strong acid) in water, leading to the oxidation or hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

So option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Alternatively, wait, wait. Let me consider the possibility that the second reaction is an oxidation using a strong oxidizing agent. But in the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc., which don't directly act as oxidizing agents. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile under strong acidic conditions, which would convert the nitrile to an amide first and then to a carboxylic acid. So, in the presence of HCl, perhaps the nitrile reacts with water to form the carboxylic acid.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different reagent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the second reaction is using a reagent that converts the nitrile into an amide, which then is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is using a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. For example, KMnO4 in HCl. But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is in H2O with HCl, perhaps providing the acidic environment for the oxidation.

Wait, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. So if the reaction uses KMnO4 and HCl, it would oxidize the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But I don't see KMnO4 as a reagent in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

In the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. Maybe it's acting as a catalyst or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of HSO3^- which can act as a nucleophile. But that doesn't quite fit because the product is a cyanohydrin, which suggests the addition of CN-.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is in the presence of a strong base, but NaHSO3 in solution would release H+ and SO3^2- which is a weak base. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if A is H3O+, then the first reaction is acid-catalyzed, which makes sense for the cyanohydrin formation.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: [nitrile compound] + HCl (B) in H2O → [carboxylic acid].

So the correct option would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Alternatively, let me think if the second reaction uses acetic acid. Could that work? If B is acetic acid, the solution would be acidic, but perhaps not strong enough for the hydrolysis. HCl is a stronger acid, so more likely.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is a stronger acid than acetic acid. So under acidic conditions, perhaps the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid.

Hmm. I think I'm leaning towards option A.


The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, and the second reaction is the oxidation of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Reaction 1: Formation of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
Butan-2-one ((CH₃)₂CO) reacts with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (option A) is a suitable acid catalyst for this reaction. If A were NaHSO₃, it would not provide the necessary acidic environment for cyanohydrin formation.

### Reaction 2: Oxidation of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid in the presence of water. The reagent B must create an acidic environment to facilitate this transformation. **HCl** (a strong acid) is more effective than CH₃COOH (a weak acid) in providing the necessary conditions for the hydrolysis and oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, B = HCl is the appropriate choice.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl):** Correct for both reactions. H₃O⁺ catalyzes cyanohydrin formation, and HCl provides the acidic environment for nitrile oxidation.
- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH):** Incorrect because CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for the second reaction.
- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl):** Incorrect because NaHSO₃ does not provide the necessary acidic environment for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH):** Incorrect for the same reasons as options C and B.

### Conclusion
The correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
