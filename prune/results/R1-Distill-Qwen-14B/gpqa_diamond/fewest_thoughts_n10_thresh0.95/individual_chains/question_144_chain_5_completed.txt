Okay, I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The question is asking for the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. I remember that the decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and speed, but let me get the exact formula.

Wait, the mean decay distance should be c multiplied by the proper lifetime of the particle, right? But since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, I think I need to account for time dilation. So, the lifetime I should use is the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma.

Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the mean decay distance is c multiplied by gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau. Gamma is E/(m c²) or something like that. Oh wait, E is the total energy, so gamma would be E/(m c²). Let me see: E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, in units where c=1, that's just E/m. But since I'm working with units where perhaps c is not 1, I need to be careful.

But wait, the problem is in natural units, maybe? Because E and m are given in GeV and GeV, so perhaps they are using units where c=1, and then we can convert to meters using appropriate constants.

Wait, the decay length formula is L = gamma * c * tau. Tau is the proper lifetime, which is related to the width Γ. The width Γ is the energy width, and tau is related to the width as tau = ħ/(Γ). But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s, so if Γ is in GeV, then tau would be in seconds. Then, I need to compute gamma, multiply by c, multiply by tau, and get the distance.

So putting it all together, L = gamma * (c * tau) = gamma * (c * ħ / Γ). 

But wait, let's write this step by step.

First, calculate the proper lifetime tau. Tau is ħ divided by the decay width Γ. So:

tau = ħ / Γ.

Then, the Lorentz factor gamma is E_X / m_X c². But in units where c=1, it's E_X / m_X.

Wait, but the units here might be a bit tricky. Let me check.

In particle physics, energies and masses are often given in GeV, and natural units are used where c=1 and ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s. So, let's proceed in units where c=1 and ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ. So, tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah.

Now, gamma is E_X / m_X. Given E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV.

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666... So, approximately 6.6667.

Now, the mean lifetime as observed is gamma * tau. Because of time dilation, the lifetime is longer when moving at high speed. So, the lifetime tau_observed = gamma * tau.

Then, the decay length L is c multiplied by tau_observed. But wait, in natural units, c is 3e8 m/s. So,

L = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait: tau is already in seconds. So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * gamma * tau.

So plugging in the numbers:

gamma ≈ 6.6667,

tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ let's calculate that.

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ let's see: 6 * 2e-24 is 1.2e-23, but more precisely,

2.056875 *6.6667 ≈ let's compute 2.056875 *6 is about 12.34125, 2.056875 *0.6667 ≈ 1.371. So total about 13.712. So 13.712e-24 s. Wait, wait, 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approximately 13.712e-24 s? Wait, 6.6667 multiplied by 2.056875 is roughly 13.712. So 13.712e-24 s.

Then, L = 3e8 m/s * 13.712e-24 s = 3e8 * 1.3712e-23 m.

Wait, 3e8 * 1.3712e-23 = (3 * 1.3712) * (1e8 * 1e-23) ) = 4.1136 * 1e-15 m.

So approximately 4.1136e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my approximation is about 4.11e-15 m. The closest is option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I made some approximation errors in the intermediate steps. Let me do the calculations more precisely.

First, compute tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = let me compute that:

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau = 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. Because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 s.

Wait, wait: 6.582e-25 is 6.582 * 1e-25.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

Which is 20.56875 * 1e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Oh, okay, that's correct.

Then, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So 20/3 exactly.

So gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

So tau_observed = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 20/3 * 2.056875e-24.

20/3 is approximately 6.6666667.

So 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.056875e-24 * 6.6666667 = ?

Let me compute 2.056875 *6.6666667.

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6666667 ≈ 1.37125.

So total is approximately 13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s.

Then, L = c * tau_observed.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s = 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 m.

3e8 *1.37125e-23 = (3 *1.37125) * (1e8 * 1e-23) )= 4.11375 * 1e-15 m.

So L ≈4.11375e-15 m. But the options have 4.0655e-15 m as option B and 5.0223e-15 as option C.

Hmm, so why the slight discrepancy? Maybe my approximations are off, or perhaps I need to use more precise values for hbar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations.

Let me recompute tau:

tau = ħ / Γ.

We have ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32 precisely.

6.582 / 0.32 equals:

0.32 goes into 6.582.

0.32 * 20 =6.4.

6.582-6.4 =0.182.

0.182 /0.32 = approximately 0.56875.

So 20.56875. So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 = 6.666... So exactly, 6.6666666667.

So tau_observed = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.

20/3 is about 6.6666666667.

So 2.056875e-24 * 20/3 = (20 * 2.056875e-24 ) /3.

20 * 2.056875e-24 =41.1375e-24 =4.11375e-23.

Divide by 3: 4.11375e-23 /3 =1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait, no, wait: 20/3 multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 20/3 is 6.666666... So 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 2.056875e-24 * 6.666666667.

I can compute 2.056875 *6.666666667.

6.666666667 is 20/3, so 2.056875 * (20/3) = (2.056875 *20)/3.

2.056875 *20 =41.1375.

41.1375 /3 =13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s.

Then L = c * tau_observed.

c is approximately 299,792,458 m/s, but often approximated as 3e8 m/s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s = 3e8 *1.37125e-23 m.

Wait, 3e8 *1.37125e-23 = 3 *1.37125 =4.11375, and 1e8 *1e-23 =1e-15. So 4.11375e-15 m.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C:5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm. I'm getting 4.11375e-15 m. But none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check.

Gamma is E / (m c²), but wait, in natural units, c=1, so gamma is E_X / m_X.

But wait, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So 8 / 1.2 is indeed 20/3≈6.6667.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the formula used is different. Wait, sometimes the decay length is given by L = c * tau * beta * gamma.

Wait, beta is v/c, and for a high-energy particle, beta is approximately 1 when gamma is large. But for precise calculation, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) )? Or more accurately, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately.

Wait, the velocity beta is v/c. Let's compute beta.

E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, E² = p² c² + m² c^4.

But in terms of beta and gamma, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, another approach: beta = v/c = (pc)/(E). So beta = (p c)/E.

But since E = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), we can write p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) )/(c^2) ) /c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

But since we're in natural units where c=1, this simplifies to beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So:

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

1.2 squared is 1.44, 8 squared is 64.

1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approximately 0.9887. Hmm, that's about 0.9887.

Wait, so beta is not exactly 1. So, in the decay length formula, it's L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, did I forget beta before? So my earlier calculation didn't account for beta. So the correct formula is L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Oh no! So I must have missed a factor of beta in the calculation.

So let me recalculate.

So, tau is still ħ/Γ = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)).

Compute 1.44 /64 =0.0225.

1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

So,

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * (20/3) ≈0.9887 *6.6666667 ≈6.5913.

So, 6.5913.

Then,

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.5913 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no: L is c * beta * gamma * tau. Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

c =3e8 m/s,

beta * gamma ≈6.5913,

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.5913 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute 6.5913 *2.056875e-24.

6.5913 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 6.5913 * 2.056875.

6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.5913 * 2.056875≈ approximately 1.215.

Total ≈13.55625.

So, 13.55625e-24 s.

Then, L =3e8 m/s *13.55625e-24 s.

Which is 3e8 *1.355625e-23 m.

Multiply 3 * 1.355625 =4.066875.

So, 4.066875e-15 m.

Ah! That's very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]

Using \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Then, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.5913 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

\[
L = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.355625 \times 10^{-23}.
\]

\[
L \approx 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
