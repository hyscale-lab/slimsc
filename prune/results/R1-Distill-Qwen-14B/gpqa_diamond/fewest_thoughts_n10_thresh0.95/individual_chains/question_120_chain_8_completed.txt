Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means they're farther away.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution in terms of space? Or maybe in terms of density? Oh, wait, uniform distribution probably means that the number of stars is the same in all directions, but that might not directly translate. I think it's saying that the density of stars is uniform throughout space, not just on the sky surface. So the number of stars doesn't depend on direction, just on distance.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So, looking at how the density of stars in a certain parallax range varies as parallax changes.

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So higher plx means closer. Since the star distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume should be proportional to that volume.

So let's think about a shell at a certain distance d from us. The thickness of the shell would be a small change in distance, say dr. But since we're considering parallax, which is 1/d, a small change in parallax dplx would correspond to a change in distance. Let me think about how dr relates to dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then the differential is dplx = -1/(d^2) dr. So dr = -d^2 dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases (we move to closer stars), d decreases. But for the purposes of counting stars, maybe the absolute value is what matters. So the thickness in distance terms is proportional to d^2 dplx.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr, right? Because the surface area is 4πd² and thickness dr. So the volume element is 4πd² dr. Substituting dr from earlier, dr = d^2 dplx. So the volume element becomes 4πd² * d^2 dplx = 4π d^4 dplx.

Wait, but wait, I'm probably getting confused. Let me double-check. The shell's radius is d, and thickness dr. So volume is 4πd² dr. But since dr is related to dplx, let's substitute. So dr = d^2 dplx (from earlier, ignoring the sign). So the volume becomes 4π d^2 * d^2 dplx = 4π d^4 dplx.

But if the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume (since density is uniform), then number of stars N = density * volume. Since the density is uniform, say rho stars per volume, then N = rho * 4π d^4 dplx.

But we need to find the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is N/(dplx). So N per dplx is rho *4π d^4.

But wait, the question is about how this varies with plx. Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting d=1/plx into d^4 gives (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4.

So N/(dplx) = rho *4π (1/plx^4) * d^4? Wait, no. Let me re-express that. Since d = 1/plx, d^4 = (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4. Oh wait wait, no. So d^4 is (1/plx)^4, so 1/(plx^4). So N/(dplx) = rho *4π *(1/(plx^4)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think differently. The number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those two parallaxes.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model in terms of distance. The number of stars per unit distance is constant because the distribution is uniform. So, when you move to a shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume 4πd² dr. So the number per unit distance is 4πd².

But we want the number per unit parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then d^2 = 1/(plx^2). So the number of stars per unit distance is 4π (1/(plx^2)).

Wait, but distance is dr, not plx. So to get the number per unit parallax, perhaps we can express dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars per unit parallax interval is the number per unit distance multiplied by how much distance corresponds to a unit parallax change.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differentiation. Let me model it.

Let N be the number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx. The number is proportional to the volume between those two parallaxes. So N = 4π ∫ (d)^2 dr, where d is between 1/(plx + dplx) and 1/plx.

Wait, integrating from d = 1/(plx + dplx) to d=1/plx. Let me make a substitution. Let plx = 1/d. Then, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dr, which is negative. But let me not worry about the sign for now.

So the integral becomes ∫ from d= a to d= b of 4π d² dr, where a=1/(plx + dplx) and b=1/plx.

But perhaps it's easier to compute this for small dplx, so we can approximate the integral as the volume of a thin shell. For small dplx, we can approximate the integral as 4π (d)^2 dr, where d is the average value. But maybe better to perform the integral exactly.

Wait, let me switch variables. Let plx = 1/d. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dr = -d^2 dplx.

Wait, the integral I'm trying to compute is the volume between d1 and d2, where d1 = 1/(plx + dplx) and d2 = 1/plx.

So, N = 4π ∫ (from d1 to d2) d² dr.

But substituting dr = - (1/d²) dplx, so dplx = - d² dr. Hmm, maybe it's easier to change variables.

Let me change variable from d to plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the integral, N = 4π ∫ (d from d1 to d2) d² dr = 4π ∫ (plx from plx to plx + dplx) (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of substitution.

Wait, d = 1/plx, so when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dr = - (d^2) dplx.

So, the integral becomes:

N = 4π ∫ (from d= d2 to d=d1) d² dr = 4π ∫ (d=1/(plx + dplx) to d=1/plx) d² dr

But since plx increases, d decreases, so the integral goes from higher d to lower d. So to make it positive, I can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign.

So N = 4π ∫ (d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx)) d² (- dr) )

=4π ∫ (d=1/(plx) to d=1/(plx +dplx)) d² (- dr) )

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since d = 1/plx, dr = - d^2 dplx.

So, the integral becomes:

N = 4π ∫ (from plx to plx + dplx) (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx²) dplx) )

Wait, that's d^2 dr = (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) )

So the integrand becomes 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx )

Wait, but that would be 4π * (-1/plx^4) dplx.

But since the integral is from plx to plx + dplx, and the integrand is negative, perhaps I should flip the limits.

So N = 4π ∫ (from plx to plx + dplx) [1/(plx'^2)] * [ - (1/(plx'^2)) dplx' ] 

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me think in terms of differentials.

If I have a thin shell at parallax plx, with thickness dplx, what is the volume corresponding to this shell?

The volume element dV is 4π d² dr. But since d = 1/plx, and dr = - d² dplx = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 dplx) )

Wait, so that's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But dV must be positive, so perhaps the negative sign indicates the direction, but for the magnitude, it's 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this shell is N = (number density) * dV = rho * 4π d^2 dr.

But substituting, N = rho * 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) )

But wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the magnitude, the number of stars is rho * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is N/dplx = 4π rho / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx (i.e., per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is ~1/plx^4.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the number of stars per unit distance is 4π d^2. Since d=1/plx, that's 4π/(plx^2). So if I'm looking for number per unit distance, it's 1/plx^2. But the question is about number per unit plx.

So the number per unit plx is (number per unit distance) multiplied by (distance per unit plx). Because if you have stars per distance, and you want stars per plx, you need to know how much distance corresponds to a unit plx.

Wait, maybe that's a better way to think. Let's see.

The number of stars per unit distance is s = 4π d^2.

We can write s = 4π (1/plx)^2.

But we want the number per unit plx, which is s multiplied by (dr/dplx). Because if you have s per unit dr, then per unit plx is s * (dr/dplx).

But dr = d^2 dplx, so dr/dplx = d^2 = (1/plx)^2.

So the number per unit plx is s * (dr/dplx) = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) )= 4π/(plx^4).

So again, same conclusion: number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A higher parallax corresponds to a closer star, while a lower parallax corresponds to a more distant star.

2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the star distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to its volume.

3. **Expressing \( dr \) in Terms of \( d\text{plx} \)**: From \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), differentiating gives \( d\text{plx} = -\frac{1}{d^2} dr \), or \( dr = -d^2 d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

4. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to the volume element per unit \( d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume element \( 4\pi d^2 dr \), we get:
   \[
   \text{Number of stars per unit } d\text{plx} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
