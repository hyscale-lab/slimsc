Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them are the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms.

Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic system, right? But in a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems, kind of like a cube that's been compressed along all axes equally but with the angles changed. So in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, a=b=c, but the angles between them are equal and not 90 degrees. So it's like a stretched or compressed cube.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(h l cos β) + 2(k l cos α) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula:

d = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α))^{-1/2} * a ?

Wait, perhaps I should get the exact formula. The general formula for d is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, or maybe it's:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^{-1} ?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, right, the formula comes from the Miller indices h, k, l and the metric tensor of the crystal. For a rhombohedral system where a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal to θ (which is 30 degrees in this case), the formula simplifies.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is defined by a, and angles α, β, γ, which are all equal. So in this case, α=β=γ=30 degrees.

The general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / [sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) +
