Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Oh wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me look again. Oh right, it's L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f(y) [v + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the v is a constant or another field? Not sure yet, but perhaps it's not too important for determining the possible decays.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Alright, so I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, the possible decay products depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. The rule is that the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. So for a decay X → f f̄, the fermion f's mass must be less than half of X's mass because each f would have mass m_f, and 2m_f ≤ m_X. Wait, is that right? Because the rest mass of each particle when they are produced at rest would require that their combined rest energy doesn't exceed the X's mass. So yeah, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Now, I need to list all the fermions that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the known fermion masses.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): mass ~ 0.0005 GeV. Definitely much less than 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV. Also less.
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV. Also less than 3.
- What about neutrinos? Their masses are negligible, so probably we don't consider them in this context because they're too light. Plus, the decay to neutrinos would require another process maybe, but I'm not sure. But the problem lists options with e+, μ+, τ+ etc., so maybe neutrinos aren't considered here.

Quarks:
Light quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (current mass), but their constituent mass is higher, but in terms of actual particle mass, the up and down are light. So their mass is <<3 GeV.
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV. Also less than 3.
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV. Less than 3, so yes.
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV. Wait, this is above 3 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then 2m_b would be about 8-9 GeV, which is more than 6. So the bottom quark is too heavy. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

Wait, that's conflicting with the options. Let me check the exact masses again. Wait, the current quark masses (the mass when the quark is free) are lower than when they're bound in hadrons. But I think for decay purposes, the mass that matters is the rest mass of the fermion, which for quarks would be their current masses. Or wait, perhaps for the decay X → f f̄, the mass of the fermion is the one that's important. So let me get some precise masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.777 GeV
Up: ~0.003 GeV
Down: ~0.004 GeV
Strange: ~0.095 GeV
Charm: ~1.27 GeV
Bottom: ~4.7 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

So, for each fermion pair, 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible option:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but b has a mass of ~4.7 GeV. So 2m_b = ~9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes a decay that's not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

c is 1.27 GeV, so 2m_c = 2.54 GeV <6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

Other options: s (0.095 GeV), so 2*0.095 is 0.19 <6. u: same, d: same.

Tau: 1.777, 2*1.777=3.554 <6. So yes.

Leptons: e, muon, tau, all allowed.

So what about the quarks in option B? They include c, s, u, d. So all their 2m_f <6 GeV.

But wait, what about the top quark? It's not in any options, but its mass is way too high, so it's not relevant.

So option B includes c, which is allowed. But wait, is c the only heavy quark besides b and t? So in this case, option B would be allowed.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B doesn't include b, which is correct because 2m_b is too big.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Again, same issue as A: b is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, etc. But t is top quark with mass ~173 GeV. 2m_t is way bigger than 6 GeV. So t t̄ decay is impossible. So C is incorrect.

So the correct options are B and D, but D has b which is too heavy. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So which fermions are involved? The f here is the flavor index. So the interaction is with the fermion ψ_f. So which fermions are f in this case?

Wait, the problem says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the field X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the decay X → f f̄ is possible only if X couples to f. So the possible decay products are the fermions that the X couples to.

So, the fermions that are involved are the ones that have this interaction. So if X only couples to, say, up-type quarks, then it would decay into u ū, c c̄, t t̄, but wait, but earlier we saw that t is too heavy. But perhaps in this problem, X can only decay into the fermions that are in the interaction term.

Wait, the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f.

Hmm, perhaps f is a flavor index, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe f is a field, but perhaps the fermions in the interaction are the ones that X couples to.

Wait, perhaps the model allows X to interact with any fermion, but in reality, the coupling might depend on the charge or something else, but in the problem statement, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling, so X could decay into any fermion as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

But wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the fermions f that have a Yukawa interaction with X would be those that can be decay products.

But perhaps the fermion in the interaction term is all possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is with all fermions, so X can decay into any allowed fermions based on mass and charge conservation.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays, so perhaps the question is only about the mass constraints, not about whether the interaction term allows it. Because the interaction term may allow it, but the kinematics (masses) may restrict.

But the problem says, "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So the interaction is with fermion fields ψ_f. So the X couples to any fermion ψ_f, as long as the Lagrangian term exists.

So the possible decay products would be any fermion pair, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So going back: X can decay into any fermion f where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So which fermions satisfy that? Let's list all possible fermions and their masses (current masses):

- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed
- μ: 0.105 → allowed
- τ: 1.777 → allowed
- u: 0.003 → allowed
- d: 0.004 → allowed
- s: 0.095 → allowed
- c: 1.27 → allowed
- b: 4.7 → 2m=9.4 >6 → not allowed
- t:173 → way too big.

So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Therefore, the decay products would include all these fermion-antifermion pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e. So all allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

Option C includes t, which is too heavy.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). The decays depend on the masses of the fermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \), which must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) (i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
The masses of known fermions (in GeV) are approximately:
- \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

Fermions \( b \) and \( t \) are excluded because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. **Incorrect**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**.

Answer: B
