--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the lifetime and the velocity times the speed of light. So, formula-wise, it's c * τ * β, where β is v/c.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the energy width. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a resonance, the natural linewidth Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to be careful with units here. Let me jot down the equations.

First, compute the lifetime τ. Then find the velocity β, and then multiply by c*τ to get the decay length.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

What's ħ in GeV·s? Let's see. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, that's right because 1 GeV is about 1.6e-10 J, but I think the value of ħ in GeV·s is around 6.58e-25.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh right, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: let's see, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is about 20.569... So 20.569e-25 s. So τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds? Wait, wait. Wait 6.582 / 0.32 is actually 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32.

6.582 divided by 0.32. Well, 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is 20.56875 (since 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582). So τ is approximately 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24.

Wait, wait, 1e-25 multiplied by 20.56875 is 2.056875e-24. Right.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity β. How to get that. Well, since the particle is a meson, I can use relativistic energy.

The production energy is E_X =8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV. The rest mass is m =1.2 GeV/c².

In terms of relativistic energy, E = γ m c².

So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But in units where c is in m/s, but since m is in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of β and γ.

Wait, let me think. The energy E is given, and mass m. So the kinetic energy plus rest energy is E. Or wait, no: in particle physics, when we say E_X is the production energy, it's the total energy, so E = γ m c².

So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) is γ m (in GeV/c²) * c², but when using GeV and c in m/s, perhaps it's better to compute β.

Alternatively, another approach to find β is to compute the velocity from the energy.

So, E = γ m c², and momentum p = γ m v. Also, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, we can compute γ from E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But wait, m is given as 1.2 GeV, which is in units of GeV/c². So let's compute γ.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ = 6.666666...

Wait, that's approximately 6.6667.

Then, from γ, we can find β. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²).

So, 1/γ² = 1 - β² → β² = 1 - (1/γ²).

So, β = sqrt(1 - (1/(γ^2))).

So γ is about 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/(γ^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → β ≈ sqrt(0.9775).

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let's see. 0.988 squared is about 0.976, since 0.988^2 = (988/1000)^2 = (approx 0.976), so sqrt(0.9775) is around 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute 0.988^2: 0.988 × 0.988.

0.988 × 0.988:  (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144. Hmm, but 0.9775 is a bit higher. So let's compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885 × 0.9885.

Compute 0.9885^2:

Approximately, 0.9885 * 0.9885 = (9885/10000)^2. Let me compute 9885 * 9885.

Wait, 9885² = (9000 + 885)^2 = 9000² + 2*9000*885 + 885^2.

9000² = 81,000,000.

2*9000*885 = 18,000 * 885 = 18,000*(800+85) = 14,400,000 + 1,530,000 = 15,930,000.

885^2 = let's calculate 800^2 + 2*800*85 +85^2 = 640,000 + 136,000 + 7,225 = 640,000 + 136,000=776,000 +7,225=783,225.

Total: 81,000,000 + 15,930,000 = 96,930,000 + 783,225 = 97,713,225.

So 9885^2 is 97,713,225. Since it's (9885/10000)^2, it's 97713225e-8 → 9771.3225e-4 → 977.13225e-2 → 97.713225.

Wait, wait, 97,713,225 divided by 1e8 is 0.97713225. So 0.9885^2 = 0.97713225. Our target is 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 is 0.97713225, which is just under 0.9775. So we need a slightly higher value. Let's try 0.9887.

0.9887^2: Let me compute 0.9885^2 is 0.97713225. The difference between 0.9885 and 0.9887 is 0.0002. Let's see how much that adds.

Approximately, (a + da)^2 ≈ a^2 + 2 a da. So a is 0.9885, da is 0.0002. So the square is about 0.97713225 + 2 * 0.9885 * 0.0002.

Compute 2 * 0.9885 * 0.0002 = 0.0003954. So new square is approximately 0.97713225 + 0.0003954 = 0.97752765. Which is a bit over 0.9775. So 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So, back to the decay length. Decay length L = c * τ * β.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 m. 3 * 2.056875 is 6.170625, so 6.170625e-16 meters.

Now multiply by beta, which is about 0.9887.

6.170625e-16 m * 0.9887 ≈ 6.170625 * 0.9887 * 1e-16 m.

Compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.

Well, 6 * 0.9887 is about 5.9322. 0.170625 * 0.9887 is approx 0.1687.

So total approx 5.9322 + 0.1687 = 6.1009.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

6.170625 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.

= 6.170625 * (1 - 0.0113) 

= 6.170625 - 6.170625 * 0.0113.

Compute 6.170625 * 0.0113.

0.01 *6.170625 = 0.06170625.

0.0013 *6.170625 = 0.0079988125.

So total is 0.06170625 + 0.0079988125 = 0.0697050625.

So 6.170625 - 0.0697050625 = 6.10092.

So approximately 6.1009e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that L = c * τ * β.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here; maybe I messed up the calculation steps.

Wait, earlier I thought L = c * τ * β. But wait, in the decay length formula, isn't it L = c * τ * β? Or is it c * τ * γ * β?

Wait, no, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So, L = v * τ = (β c) * τ. So yes, L=β c τ.

Which is, β * c * τ.

So, correct approach.

So, c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.057e-24 s.

beta is 0.9887.

So,

L = 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s * 0.9887.

So compute 3e8 * 2.057e-24 first.

3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 3 * 2.057 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.171 * 1e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.171 * 0.9887 = approx 6.1009e-16 m.

So, approximately 6.1009e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that's near 6e-16 m. The options are 5e-16 or 4e-15 or similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the width is given as 320 MeV, and I used that as 0.32 GeV, which is correct.

Tau is ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c^2). Wait, but in units where c=1, it's E/(m). So gamma =8 /1.2 =6.666666...

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, gamma is 6.666666... So 1/gamma^2 is (3/20)^2=9/400=0.0225.

So 1 -0.0225=0.9775, so sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So that's correct.

Wait, but then why is the calculated L about 6e-16, but the options are 5e-15, 4e-15, and 5e-16, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c * tau * beta.

Wait, let me recompute that.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

beta is 0.9887.

So c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =3 * 2.056875e-16 m =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 = approx 6.1009e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options are near 6e-16 m. The closest options are A)5.0223e-16 and C)5.0223e-15.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2). Wait, but in natural units where c=1 and E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², E = gamma m c^2.

Wait, perhaps I should write E in units of GeV, m c² is m * c^2 in GeV.

Wait, m=1.2 GeV/c². So m c² = 1.2 GeV. So E =8 GeV = gamma * m c² → gamma =8 /1.2 =6.666... So that part is correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the natural line width formula differently. Maybe the mean lifetime is related to the width as Γ = ħ * tau^{-1} ?

Wait, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, so if Γ is the uncertainty in energy, then Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Yes, that's correct. So tau is ħ / Γ.

Hmm. Let me recheck the calculation.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should use the total decay width. But in this case, it's given as Γ_X=320 MeV, so using that is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta.

Gamma is 6.666666..., so gamma squared is 44.444444.

1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (1/44.444444) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = 0.9887.

Wait, maybe using a more precise calculation for sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me think. 0.9775 is the number.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

We can use a Taylor expansion or iterative method. Let me see.

Let me assume x = 0.9887.

x^2 = (0.9887)^2 = ?

Well, 0.9887 is about 0.9887*0.9887.

Let me compute:

(0.9887)^2 = (approx) (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

(0.0087)^2 = 0.00007569.

So total is 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 +0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is about 0.97752769. But we needed 0.9775. So 0.9887 is correct.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, so the decay length is approximately 6.10e-16 meters.

But none of the options match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm. So none of the options are close to 6e-16 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length formula uses the mean lifetime, but perhaps the decay width is given in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the velocity as beta * c, and multiply by tau.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the decay width is given in MeV, which I converted to GeV (0.32 GeV). But perhaps I should keep everything in GeV and other units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the decay length in terms of the natural units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = c * tau * beta, but perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options are off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, gamma is 0.32 GeV, so tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, so I should use Γ = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but wait, perhaps the width is given in the same units as the energy. Hmm, I think I didn't make a mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the particle's energy correctly. Wait, the decay width relates to the mean lifetime, so that's correct.

Hmm. I'm getting a decay length of about 6.1e-16 m, but the options are all around 4e-15, 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculation.

Wait, let me recompute c * tau * beta.

c =3e8 m/s.

tau =2.056875e-24 s.

beta =0.9887.

So:

c * tau =3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 *2.056875 ) * 1e-16 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 = approximately 6.1009e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are A:5.0223e-16, D:4.0655e-16.

Hmm. So my calculation is higher than the highest option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different formula for beta.

Wait, another approach: since E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v.

But perhaps using E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So,

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).

So,

p c = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) GeV = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So,

p c =7.91 GeV.

But p = gamma m v / c.

So, p c = gamma m v.

So,

gamma m v =7.91 GeV.

But gamma m c^2 =8 GeV → gamma m = 8 / c² GeV.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, E = gamma m c^2 → gamma m c^2 =8 GeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So, p c =7.91 GeV.

But p = gamma m v / c.

So,

p c = gamma m v.

So,

gamma m v =7.91 GeV.

But gamma m c^2 =8 GeV → gamma m = 8/(c²) GeV/(c²) * c² → unit-wise, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of p.

v = (p c^2) / (E).

Wait, because:

p = gamma m v → v = p c^2 / (gamma m c^2) ), but E = gamma m c^2.

So,

v = (p c^2) / E.

But,

p c =7.91 GeV.

So,

v = (7.91 GeV * c^2) / (8 GeV) ) * (1/c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of beta.

Beta is v/c = (p c^2) / (E c) ) / c^2 → wait, perhaps beta = (p c^2) / (E c^2) ) → beta = p c / E.

Because:

p c = gamma m v → v = (p c) / (gamma m).

But E = gamma m c^2 → gamma m = E/(c^2).

So,

v = (p c) / (E/(c^2)) ) → v = (p c^3 ) / E.

Hmm, that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, beta = v/c = (p c^2) / (E c) ) → beta = (p c) / E.

Because:

p = gamma m v → v = p c^2 / (gamma m c^2) → v = (p c^2) / E.

So, beta = v/c = (p c^2) / (E c) ) → beta = (p c) / E.

Yes, that seems right.

So, beta = (p c ) / E.

We have p c =7.91 GeV.

E is8 GeV.

So,

beta =7.91 /8 ≈0.98875.

Which is the same as before. So beta is approximately 0.98875.

So that calculation is correct.

Hmm, but then why do I get a decay length of ~6e-16 m, but the options are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in tau calculation.

Wait, perhaps the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, so tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 =2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the decay width in a different way. Wait, in particle physics, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ.

But sometimes, Γ is given as the total decay width, which is the sum of partial widths, but in this case, the mean decay width is already given.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = c * tau * beta * gamma?

No, because beta is v/c, so v=beta c. So the distance is v*tau = beta c tau.

Which is what I did.

Hmm, maybe I should use another formula, such as L = (c tau) * beta.

Which I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation requires using relativistic expressions for beta and gamma in a different way.

Wait, another approach: using the relation between lifetime and energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the time dilation factor. Wait, tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau.

Wait, no, the proper lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau.

So, the mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma tau.

But the decay length is then v times the lifetime, which is beta c gamma tau.

So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the mean decay length is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So,

L = v * gamma tau.

But v = beta c.

So,

L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me compute this.

Wait, but earlier I thought L = beta c tau, but perhaps I was wrong. Because the decay width gives the proper lifetime tau. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

So, the decay length is L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c gamma tau.

So, perhaps I missed a factor of gamma in the earlier calculation.

Ah, this could be where I went wrong.

So the correct formula for decay length is L = beta c gamma tau.

So, let me recompute.

L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

So, with beta=0.98875, gamma=6.666666..., c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

Compute each part:

beta * gamma = 0.98875 *6.66666667 ≈6.6.

Wait, let me compute 0.98875 *6.66666667.

0.98875 *6 =5.9325.
0.98875 *0.66666667≈0.659166667.
Adding together:5.9325 +0.659166667≈6.591666667.

So, beta * gamma ≈6.591666667.

Now, L = (beta gamma) * c tau.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 meters.

Wait, no: c tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

But then L = (beta gamma) * c tau.

So,

(6.591666667) *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.591666667 *6.170625e-16.

6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.591666667 *6.170625 ≈3.647.

So total is approx 37.02375 +3.647 =40.67075e-16 m →4.067075e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is4.0655e-16 m.

So 4.067e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Ah, so I see now. I must have missed the gamma factor earlier. That's why the initial calculation gave 6e-16, but after including gamma, it's about 4e-15.

So the correct answer should be option B or D.

Wait, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to our calculation of 4.067e-15 m.

Hmm. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute beta * gamma:

beta =0.98875.

gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666666667.

beta * gamma =0.98875 *6.666666667.

Let me compute it more precisely.

0.98875 *6.666666667.

That's 0.98875 * (20/3) = (0.98875 *20)/3 =19.775 /3 ≈6.591666667.

So, beta gamma =6.591666667.

Now, c tau is3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

So,

L =6.591666667 *6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply 6.591666667 *6.170625.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.591666667 *6=3.55.

0.591666667 *0.170625≈0.1009.

So,

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.591666667 *6.170625=3.647.

Adding 37.02375 +3.647=40.67075 → 4.067075e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at option B:4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Hmm, so the answer is option B.

But wait, why did I get a factor of gamma earlier when I thought I didn't need it?

Ah, because tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), but when the particle is moving, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime.

Thus, L = v * (gamma tau) ) = beta c gamma tau.

So that's why I had to include gamma.

So, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass is \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we compute:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5917.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest option to the calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**
