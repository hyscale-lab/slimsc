Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to pick the right one.

Alright, the data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which might correspond to a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester). The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or something else, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide, but I don't think there's any amide info here. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a conjugated ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has some double bonds, maybe from an alkene or maybe part of a ring structure.

Then, the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments with that mass... maybe something like (CH3)2O? Because (CH3)2O has a molecular weight of 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16= 24+6+16=46 wait, no, wait. Let me calculate: (CH3)2O is (2*15) for the two CH3 groups (each is 15) and O is 16. So 15*2 +16= 46. Oh, that's m/z 46. Hmm, not matching 45. Alternatively, maybe CH2O (formaldehyde) but that's 30. Or maybe a fragment like C3H7O? Wait, maybe it's an acylium ion or something else.

Wait, another thought. The molecular ion might break into smaller ions. Maybe a common fragment is something like (CH2O), but that's 30. Or perhaps a ketene ion? Or maybe it's an aldehyde group losing something. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ester group.

Wait, 45 could be CH2COOH? No, that's 60. Hmm. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Wait, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each of these. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N mentioned, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12.
(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But earlier, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So maybe a ring plus a double bond? Or a triple bond. Hmm, but 1 degree could be either one ring or one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. C=6, H=10.
(2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. C=6, H=10.
(2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees again.

Option D: C6H12O. C=6, H=12.
(2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So same as option A: one degree, either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there must be a double bond. So the degree of unsaturation from the double bond plus any rings. Let's see:

If a compound has a double bond, that's one degree. If it's a ring, another. So a molecule with a ring and a double bond would have two degrees. So which options have two or more degrees?

Option B: C6H10O has 2 degrees. So could be a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 has 2 degrees. So same, ring and double bond, or two double bonds.

Options A and D have only one degree. But the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So A and D could have a double bond but would only have one degree of unsaturation. That would mean if it's a double bond only, with no rings. But the IR has 1700 and 1650 peaks. Hmm.

Wait, the IR peaks: 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbony
