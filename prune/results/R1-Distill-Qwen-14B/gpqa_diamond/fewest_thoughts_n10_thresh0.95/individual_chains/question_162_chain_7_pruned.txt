Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. Let me think. I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like, it's kind of a hyperbolic shape. So the metric given must be representing some kind of pseudosphere.

The metric is given as ds² equals 32 divided by (4 minus x² minus y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, so the line element is in terms of x and y, which probably means we're working in 2D coordinates. I'm a bit rusty on the exact forms, but I think for surfaces of revolution, especially pseudospheres, the metric can be written in terms of coordinates like these.

The question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, I thought the radius of a pseudosphere relates to its curvature. Oh right, the Gaussian curvature K is equal to -1/(r²), where r is the radius of curvature. So if r is 2, then K would be -1/(4). But wait, how does that relate to the metric?

Looking at the metric, the coefficient of (dx² + dy²) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). That reminds me of the metric for a sphere, but with a negative curvature. Because for a sphere, the metric would have a (1/(a² - x² - y²)) factor, but here it's 32 over (4 - ...). So maybe 4 is related to r squared? Because r is 2, so 2 squared is 4. So that makes sense. So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)). 

Wait, so the metric looks like ds² = (32 / (4 - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²). That suggests it's a metric for a space with constant curvature, which would be either spherical or hyperbolic. Since the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)), which under square root is similar to the metric for hyperbolic space or a pseudosphere. Wait, no, for a sphere, the metric is (1/(a² - r²)) where r is the radial coordinate, but in this case, the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)), implying that x² + y² <4, so it's a disk-like coordinate system.

Wait, but pseudosphere metrics are usually in the form where the metric becomes singular at the boundary. So the area of the pseudosphere would require integrating the area element over the region where the metric is defined.

The area element in such a metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is 2D and the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal components. So the metric tensor g has components (32/(4 - x² - y²), 0; 0, 32/(4 - x² - y²)). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no, wait. The metric is written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² + ... but here it's just dx² + dy² multiplied by a scalar. So the metric tensor is diagonal with both g_11 and g_22 equal to 32/(4 -x² -y²). So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². But when calculating the area element, we take the square root of the determinant, so sqrt(det) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the determinant of a diagonal metric with both terms equal is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The sqrt of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So to find the area, I need to integrate this area element over the region where the metric is defined. The coordinates x and y must satisfy 4 - (x² + y²) >0, because the denominator can't be zero or negative (as we can't take the square root of a negative number in real coordinates; I think for pseudospheres, it's a hyperbolic metric, so maybe the denominator is positive or negative, but I'm not sure. Wait, in standard hyperbolic coordinates, sometimes you have terms like (1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but I might be mixing up the forms.

Wait, but let's proceed. The integration region is where 4 - (x² + y²) > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 (since sqrt(4)=2) in the x-y plane.

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral. Maybe it's easier in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So factor out the constants and the angular integral:

A = (32) * ∫(0 to 2π) dθ ∫(0 to2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The angular integral is straightforward: ∫0 to2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Now, compute the radial integral:

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. 

When r=0, u=4-0=4. When r=2, u=4-4=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ r dr / u ] → substituting, r dr = -du/2. So:

∫ (4 to 0) ( (-du/2) ) / u → ∫ (4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du.

Which is equal to ( -1/2 ) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Reversing the limits, that's ( -1/2 ) ∫ (4→0) → (1/2) ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du.

Wait, wait, let me do it correctly. The substitution turns the integral into:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2)/u ] = ∫ (u=4 to u=0) (-1/(2u)) du.

Which is the same as ∫ (u=0 to u=4) [1/(2u)] du. Because when you flip the limits, the negative sign cancels.

Wait no, when you change the limits from 4 to 0 to 0 to 4, the integral becomes positive. So:

∫ (4 to 0) [ (-1/(2u)) du ] = ∫ (0 to4) [ (1/(2u)) du ].

So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du.

But wait, ∫(1/u) du is ln |u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to 4:

(1/2) [ ln(4) - ln(0) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity. That would mean the area A is infinite.

Wait, that makes sense? Because a pseudosphere is an infinite surface in terms of area, right? Its surface area is infinite. So the area would be infinite, which corresponds to option D, which is +infty.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, so the answer should be D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a pseudosphere, a surface of constant negative curvature. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \). The radius of curvature \( r \) is related to the Gaussian curvature \( K \) by \( K = -1/r^2 \), so here \( K = -1/4 \).

To compute the area, we use the area element in this metric, which is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The integration region is where \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), i.e., \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac
