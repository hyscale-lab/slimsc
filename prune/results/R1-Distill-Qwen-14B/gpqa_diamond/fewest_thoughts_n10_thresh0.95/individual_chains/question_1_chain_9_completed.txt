Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It's about the relationship between the energy (or more accurately, the energy uncertainty) and the lifetime (or time uncertainty) of a state. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. A longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty because ΔE would be approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties for us to clearly distinguish them, right?

Let me calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. The reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the options are in electron volts. Oh, right, I should convert units. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602176634e-19 joules.

So for each state:

First, for the state with lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1
= 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s
= 1.0545718e-25 J

Convert that to eV:
ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV)
≈ (1.05457e-25) / (1.60218e-19)
≈ 6.58e-7 eV

Wait, wait, because I'm using ħ as 1e-34, but is that right? Let me think again. Oh, no, I should have considered that the actual formula uses ħ, which is h/(2π), so the calculation is correct.

Wait, but another approach is to remember that 1 eV·s is approximately 1.50919e-16 J·s. Hmm, maybe another way to calculate it.

Alternatively, I think that the energy-time uncertainty relation can be written as ΔE ≈ ħ / (2 τ), but sometimes people ignore the factor of 2 for order of magnitude purposes. So maybe I should consider both possibilities, but perhaps the problem is considering the approximate relation without the factor of 2.

So for τ1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1
Which is approximately (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Converting to eV:
1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 ≈ 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting:
1.05e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 6.56e-7 eV and 6.56e-8 eV for the two states.

But wait, the question says we need to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, we can't tell them apart—they might overlap.

So the minimum energy difference ΔE_min is about (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let me compute that:

ΔE1 is approx 6.56e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV. Adding them:

6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → too small
B) 1e-11 eV → way too small
C)1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than our sum. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. Which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So the energy difference would be clearly resolved if it's larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So that would work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1e-8, which is less than 7.2e-7. So it's not enough.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the exact values.

Calculating ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
τ1 = 1e-9 s
ΔE1 = ħ/(2π τ1) → Wait, wait, no, the energy uncertainty is ħ/(2τ) in some textbooks. Hmm, but I think sometimes the formula is written as ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty is roughly in the order of ħ/(2τ), but if we're just looking for an order of magnitude, perhaps we can ignore the constant factors.

But perhaps the exact formula is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So:

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 5.27e-26 J. Converting to eV:

5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. → 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 → approx 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is about 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than 3.62e-7 eV. Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV, much larger than 3.6e-7. So that would be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 3.6e-7, so it would not be resolvable.

Other options: A is 1e-9, which is 0.000000001 eV, which is way too small. B is 1e-11, even smaller.

So the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait again. The question gives the lifetimes of the states as 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. What's the relation between the energy and the lifetime?

The uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty. So E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) than E2 (1e-8 s), so ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2. Therefore, the sum is around 3.6e-7 eV.

So the minimum ΔE between the two states must be greater than this sum for them to be distinguishable.

So the energy difference should be bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. The available options are:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 < 3.6e-7 → no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller → no.

C)1e-4 → 0.0001 → which is 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 3.6e-7 → yes.

D)1e-8 → 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 3.6e-7 → no.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime uncertainty (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for each state are approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{min}} \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{min}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]
\[
\Delta E_{\text{min}} > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Final Answer
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
