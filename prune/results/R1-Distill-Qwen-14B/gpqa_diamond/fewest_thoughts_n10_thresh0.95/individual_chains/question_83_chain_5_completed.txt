Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read the problem again. We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when we add equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2, and since V1 and V2 are equal, M2 is half of M1.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles. Moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, I think I need to find two pH values: at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH addition (25% titration) and at the equivalence point (10 cm³ added).

Let me tackle the first part: 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution. Because at 25%, we're partway into the titration, so both acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) are present.

Wait, what's the ratio of acetate to acetic acid at 25%? Let's see. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate.

So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The acetate is 0.00025 moles.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is negative. Log(1)=0, log(3)=0.477, so log(1/3) = -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can calculate it more precisely. 1/3 is approximately 0.333333. Log(0.333) is about -0.4771. So 4.733 -0.4771 = 4.2559, which is about 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), the solution will be basic. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

So, the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is determined by the moles of acetate. Initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. At equivalence, all of that has been converted to acetate. But the total volume is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ total. So concentration is (0.001 moles) / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054 * 1e-9 = 5.4054e-10.

So Kb is 5.4054e-10.

The hydrolysis of acetate is a weak base. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming that the hydrolysis is small, we can approximate that [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [OH-] is x. So, Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02. Solve for x.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.4054e-10)(0.02) = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.288) is approximately 0.5168, so pOH is 5.4832. So pH = 14 - 5.4832 ≈ 8.5168, which is about 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is small is okay here. Let me check. Kb is 5.4e-10, and 0.02 is 2e-2, so the denominator is 2e-2. So, 5.4e-10 * 2e-2 = 1.08e-11, which is x^2. x is about 3.28e-6, which is much less than 0.02, so the assumption holds.

So, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → This matches our calculations.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → No.

Option C:4.73;7 → No, because equivalence is around 8.5.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → No.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \cdot V_2 = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. At this point, a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) is present. The moles of acetic acid and acetate ion can be calculated:

- Initial moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).
- Moles of acetic acid neutralized: \( 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).
- Remaining moles of acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \).
- Moles of acetate ion formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).

The ratio of acetate to acetic acid is:

\[
\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ion. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[A^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) at equilibrium be \( x \). Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[A^-]} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [A^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH^-]) = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: 4.26; 8.52 → Correct.
- **Option B**: 3.17; 6.73 → Incorrect.
- **Option C**: 4.73; 7.00 → Incorrect.
- **Option D**: 4.57; 6.92 → Incorrect.
