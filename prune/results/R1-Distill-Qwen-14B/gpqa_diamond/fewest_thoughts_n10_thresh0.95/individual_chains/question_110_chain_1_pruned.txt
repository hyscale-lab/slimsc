Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters. The main thing I need to determine for each star is whether it's bright enough in the V band for both instruments. The key points are the magnitude limits of each spectrograph.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude (m) that's ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, right, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So brighter than 17 mag means m < 17? Because if something is brighter than 17, its magnitude would be less than 17. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So, a star with apparent magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so both can see it.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, because ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which includes brighter (m <17). HIRES can observe brighter than 16, which is m <16. So wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So apparent V mag must be less than 17. Similarly, with HIRES, apparent V mag must be less than 16.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16 because that's the more restrictive condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (m <16), then it's also brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it as well. Wait, no. Because for each, the limit is what they can observe. So for a star to be observed by
