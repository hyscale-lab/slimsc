Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number A = protons + neutrons = 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Next, I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is given by its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But wait, in high-energy physics, they often talk about total energy, which includes both the rest mass and the kinetic energy. So I think the formula for total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy (gamma * m0c²), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So since v is 0.96c, let me compute gamma here. Let's calculate that. Let me plug in v=0.96c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) ). Let's compute (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (since 0.28 squared is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is needed. The rest mass energy E0 is m0c². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately... Well, the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 g/mol. But wait, each Li-6 atom has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, 1 u is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But maybe I can find the mass in terms of MeV/c² because I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Oh right, that's a useful conversion.

So the mass of Li-6 is 6 u. So E0 = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Wait, wait, let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So E0 = 5.589 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by E0. So E = gamma * E0 = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, 3 * 5.589 = 16.767.

Then 0.5714 * 5.589: Let me compute 0.5 *5.589 = 2.7945; 0.0714 *5.589 ≈ approximately 0.400 (since 0.07*5.589≈0.3912 and 0.0014*5.589 ≈ ~0.0078, so total around 0.399). So adding 2.7945 + 0.399 gives about 3.1935.

So total E ≈ 16.767 + 3.1935 ≈ 19.9605 GeV. Wait, that's approximate. Let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, 3.5714 * 5.589. Let me compute 3.5714 *5=17.857, 3.5714 *0.589. Let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 3.5714 × 5.589:

3.5714 × 5 = 17.857

3.5714 × 0.5 = 1.7857

3.5714 × 0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 × 0.009 = 0.0321426

Adding these together:

3.5714 × 5.589 = 3.5714 × (5 + 0.5 + 0.08 + 0.009 )

Which is 17.857 + 1.7857 + 0.285712 + 0.0321426.

Adding 17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427.

19.6427 + 0.285712 = 19.9284.

19.9284 + 0.0321426 ≈ 19.96054 GeV.

So E ≈ 19.9605 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, D is 21.419. Hmmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. Because 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: let me compute sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part is correct.

Hmm, so if E is approximately 19.96 GeV, but none of the options have that. Wait, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check that.

Wait, Li-6 has a mass number of 6, so the mass is 6 u. But wait, the formula uses the rest mass, which is correct. So 6 u is 6 *931.5 MeV/c² = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh, wait! Maybe the problem is asking for the kinetic energy (K) rather than the total energy (E). Because sometimes, the energy given in colliders refers to kinetic energy.

If that's the case, then K = (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So let me compute that. Gamma is about 3.5714. So K = (3.5714 -1) * 5.589 GeV.

So (2.5714) *5.589.

Let me compute that. 2 *5.589 is 11.178. 0.5714 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945.

0.0714 *5.589 ≈ 0.400.

So 2.7945 + 0.400 ≈3.1945.

So total K ≈ 11.178 + 3.1945 = 14.3725 GeV.

But that's not matching any of the options either. So now I'm confused. Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". So I'm not sure whether they refer to the total energy or the kinetic energy.

Wait, RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, and the energy is usually given as the total energy, but sometimes as the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, perhaps using a more precise value for gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 exactly.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... That's correct.

Wait, maybe the mass is not 6 u? Let me think again. Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons, so mass is 6 u. So E0 is 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * E0 =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated this earlier. Let me do this multiplication more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.589.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.08 =0.2857142856.

3.57142857 *0.009 =0.03214285713.

Adding these together:

17.85714285 +1.785714285=19.64285714.

19.64285714 +0.2857142856=19.92857142.

19.92857142 +0.03214285713=19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the mass isn't exactly 6 u. Let me think: perhaps I should be more precise with the atomic mass. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Wait, wait, I think each Li-6 nucleus has a mass of approximately 6.015 u. Because the exact atomic weight is about 6.941 g/mol for Li, but Li-6 is a specific isotope.

Wait, actually, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0150 u. Because carbon-12 is 12 u, and Li-6 is 6 u, but due to binding energy, maybe the actual rest mass is a bit less. Wait no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is roughly 6.015 u.

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate the exact mass using the atomic weight. Let me think: the atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the isotope mix. Li-6 is about 7.5% of natural lithium. But the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Let me look up the exact value.

Wait, I'm just trying to think through this. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.01503 u.

So E0 = 6.01503 u * 931.5 MeV/u = approximately 6.01503 * 931.5 ≈ let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589, 0.01503 *931.5 ≈ approximately 13.99 MeV. So total E0≈5589 +13.99=5602.99 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

So with E0=5.603 GeV, gamma=3.5714, E=3.5714 *5.603.

Let me compute that again. 3.5714 *5=17.857, 3.5714 *0.603=?

3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 *0.003=0.0107142.

So 2.14284 +0.0107142=2.153554.

Total is 17.857 +2.153554=19.999974 GeV ≈ 20 GeV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some factors, like relativistic considerations in the mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, and I'm supposed to calculate the total energy, which is gamma*m*c².

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c, so beta = v/c =0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps using more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute beta^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 28^2 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 6.01503 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

So 6.01503 *931.5 = let me compute that.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01503 *931.5 ≈ 13.998.

So total is 5589 +13.998 =5602.998 MeV ≈5.602998 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.602998 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.602998 = ?

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.602998 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.002998 ≈3.57142857 *0.003=0.0107142857; but 0.002998 is 0.003 -0.000002.

So 0.002998 *3.57142857 ≈0.0107142857 - (3.57142857 * 0.000002) =0.0107142857 -0.000007142857≈0.01070714285.

So 3.57142857 *0.602998 =2.142857142 +0.01070714285 ≈2.153564285.

So total E =17.85714285 + 2.153564285 =19.99999999999 GeV. So about 20 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 20. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, I'm using 6.01503 u for the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6. The standard value is about 6.015033 u. So 6.015033 *931.5 MeV/u.

6.015033 *931.5 = let's compute that:

6 * 931.5 =5589.

0.015033 *931.5 = approx 13.998 MeV.

So total E0 =5589 +13.998 =5602.998 MeV =5.602998 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.602998.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.602998 can be done as:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.602998.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.002998 =approx 0.010714286.

Wait, but 0.602998 is 0.6 +0.002998.

So 3.57142857 ×0.602998 =2.142857142 + (3.57142857 ×0.002998).

3.57142857 ×0.002998 = let me compute 3.57142857 ×3e-3 =0.01071428571.

But since it's 2.998e-3, which is 0.999333333 ×3e-3.

So 0.01071428571 ×0.999333333 ≈0.0107071427.

So adding that to 2.142857142 gives 2.153564285.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.153564285 =19.99999999999 GeV.

So E≈20 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm. Am I missing something here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the exact value of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma using more precise math.

Beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.571428571428571...

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately by using a calculator approximation.

Wait, perhaps another way: using the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But maybe a more precise calculation of the square root would help, but in this case, since 0.28 squared is exactly 0.0784, the square root is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is that I need to compute the kinetic energy (K) rather than the total energy. Let me check what the question says.

The question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

In colliders, sometimes the energy refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm not 100% sure. But let's compute both.

Total energy E = gamma * m c² =20 GeV.

Kinetic energy K = E - m c² = (gamma -1)*m c² = (3.57142857 -1)*5.603 GeV.

So that's 2.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.603.

2 *5.603 = 11.206.

0.57142857 *5.603 ≈3.198.

So total K ≈14.404 GeV.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me compute 2.57142857 *5.602998.

2.57142857 *5.602998.

Compute 2 *5.602998=11.205996.

0.57142857 *5.602998=?

0.5 *5.602998=2.801499.

0.07142857 *5.602998≈0.4004.

So total is 2.801499+0.4004=3.2019.

So K =11.205996 +3.2019=14.4079 GeV.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Now I'm confused. The options don't include 20 GeV. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6. Let me look it up in my memory. Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.015033 u. So E0 =6.015033 *931.5 MeV=?

6.015033 *931.5 = let's compute that.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015033 *931.5 = let me compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005033 *931.5= approx 4.680.

So 9.315 +4.680=13.995.

So E0=5589 +13.995=5602.995 MeV=5.602995 GeV.

Now compute E = gamma * E0 =3.57142857 *5.602995.

Hmm, 3.57142857 *5.602995.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.602995.

I think the precise calculation would give about 20 GeV as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the question is about the total energy per nucleon, but I think the nucleus is being accelerated as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the energy per nucleon. Wait, no, the problem states "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c", so the entire nucleus is moving at that speed, so the energy is for the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not 6 u, but the actual atomic mass includes electrons. No, wait, in heavy ion collisions, the ions are typically bare nuclei, so electrons are removed (stripped). So the mass would just be the nuclear mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the exact formula.

E = gamma * m * c².

We have gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =3.57142857.

m =6.015033 u.

m*c² =6.015033 u * 931.5 MeV/u =5.603 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Multiplying 3.57142857 *5.603.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857.

So 2.142857142 +0.0107142857=2.153571428.

So 17.85714285 +2.153571428=19.999999999 GeV.

So E≈20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20. So I'm either missing something or perhaps the options are approximated.

Looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma using more precise sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute gamma using exact calculations.

Compute beta =0.9
