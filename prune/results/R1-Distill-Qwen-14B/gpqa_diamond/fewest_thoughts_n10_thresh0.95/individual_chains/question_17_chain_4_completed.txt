Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formula for the complex is probably something like CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. 

The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf equals [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think all the calcium is bound into the complex. But wait, no, because the complex can dissociate a bit. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low because Kf is really large (5e10), which suggests the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, but wait. The given concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So let's model this. Let's say the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Then, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-: 

CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4- 

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so for this dissociation, the equilibrium constant would be the inverse, which is 1/(5e10). Because Kf is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]), so the reverse reaction's K is 1/Kf.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me write the dissociation equation again:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- 

The formation constant Kf is 5e10. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) has a Kd (dissociation constant) of 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, the complex is already present. So let's let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M, and the dissociation is:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small because Kf is big)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but wait. No, because the initial situation is that the solution is 0.02 M complex. So when it dissociates, some x amount dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is tiny)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the expression for Kf is (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10. So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7? Wait, what's sqrt(4e-13)? 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7.

Wait, let me do the math properly. 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) → 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is somewhere in between, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M, which is about 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions would be approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. I assumed that [EDTA^4-] is equal to x. But EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and under certain pH conditions, it exists in different protonated forms. But the question says pH is ideal, so I think it's safe to assume that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, so the calculation holds.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), so the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex be \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]_0 = 0.02 \, \text{M} \). At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \quad \text{(since \( x \) is small)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
