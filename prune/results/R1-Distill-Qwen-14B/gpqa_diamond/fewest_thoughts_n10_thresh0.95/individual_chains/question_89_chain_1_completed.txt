Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, and the 1,3-dibromo part means there are Br atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane ring.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. KOH is a strong base. Wait, when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes or maybe substitution. But adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So maybe it's an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a di-elimination.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with base, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Brs on adjacent carbons if it's a diamond structure. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused in a chair-like structure. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, right? So, when we heat with a strong base like KOH, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene.

So for product 1, I think it's adamantane with a double bond where the Brs were. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming 1,3-diene? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, elimination of two HBr would form a diene, but in the case of adjacent Br atoms, it's more likely to form a single double bond. Wait but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons. Hmm, maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that when each Br is on a bridgehead, like in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is added, each Br could undergo elimination, leading to formation of double bonds. Wait, but two eliminations would require two H's adjacent to each Br. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe only one elimination occurs, but that would leave a single Br. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests maybe some kind of epoxide? Wait, no, because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group.

Wait, that's a key point. So if we started with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and treated with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait another possibility: if KOH is in a high temperature condition, perhaps it's acting as a base and causing an elimination, but if the molecule is such that the elimination leads to a carbonyl group, that would explain the IR peak. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution. Wait, no, substitution would replace Br with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, Fittig is for coupling aryl halides, which this isn't.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Because the IR at 1720 is consistent with a ketone. So perhaps the dibromide is undergoing some kind of oxidation or dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoalkane) are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form alkenes or ketones, depending on the structure. Wait, for example, in some cases, two dehydrohalogenations can form a ketone. Wait, no, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amines.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, like two E2 mechanisms, each taking a Br and a hydrogen, leading to a double bond. But that wouldn't introduce a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination followed by a keto-enol tautomerism, but that seems unlikely with adamantane.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide but a more spaced one. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on a bridgehead, then elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, how? Oh, wait, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, like in a geminal dihalide, but that's not the case here.

Wait another angle: the 1H NMR of product 1. The spectrum has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, 4.79 is probably an -OH group, but wait, no, because it's a singlet for two protons. Alternatively, maybe an -OCH2O- group, like an epoxide? Wait, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as a triplet. But 4.79 is a bit upfield for that. Alternatively, maybe an ether.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of possible reaction mechanisms.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with a base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination where the bases abstract protons leading to adjacent carbocations, but in this case, it's more likely elimination.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a methylene group next to an oxygen. For example, an acetal or an ether. But with a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone with some adjacent structure.

Wait, another thought: when you have a dihalide and you eliminate two equivalents of HX (like HBr), you could form a diene. But the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a di-ketone or a conjugated carbonyl structure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but that wouldn't produce a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of a ketone via a Hofmann-like elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination where two HBr molecules are removed, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group. Like, maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead. So elimination would form a double bond, and the bridgehead would have a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think of 1,3-dibromoadamantane as having two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads. So, when KOH is added, each Br could lose HBr, leading to a structure where the bridgeheads become part of a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So each Br is on a bridgehead. Elimination (E2) would require each Br to abstract a β-hydrogen. For each Br, eliminating HBr would form a double bond between the two bridgeheads, but perhaps that's not possible due to the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead loses a Br and a hydrogen, leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? Because each elimination would form a double bond, but two eliminations would form two double bonds, which would require a conjugated diene or perhaps a ring structure.

Wait, maybe the product after KOH is a diketone. So when two Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, each elimination forms a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH induces a elimination to form a compound with a ketone and a double bond.

Wait, but looking at the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet for two protons. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide's CH2. But in that case, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, the NMR also has 2.41-2.23 (10H)—that's a lot of hydrogens. Maybe it's the adamantane structure without Br, but with some functional groups. The 1.94 (2H) suggests another CH2 group, perhaps near an electronegative atom.

Hmm, maybe the product after KOH is an epoxide? Wait, epoxide's protons are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So 4.79 could be an epoxide CH2. But in an epoxide, the neighboring CH2 would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, but in the NMR, 4.79 is a singlet. So that can't be an epoxide because the epoxide's CH2 would be split.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ether. But again, the coupling would be different.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would be from hydrolysis, not elimination.

Wait, going back to the IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak for a carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 has a ketone group.

So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH? Maybe through a conjugate elimination.

Wait, another approach: If each Br is on a bridgehead, then upon elimination, each bridgehead would lose Br and a hydrogen, forming a carbonyl. Because in a bridgehead, if you remove H and Br, you can form a double bond or a carbonyl, depending on the structure.

Wait, wait, how does that work? Let's say each bridgehead has Br. When KOH abstracts a β-H, the Br leaves as Br–, forming a double bond. But if each bridgehead has a Br, eliminating both would form a conjugated diene? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead Br is eliminated to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to a carbene or something, but that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about alkylation. Oh wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br undergoes substitution with OH–, forming an alcohol. But that would give a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH absorption since the product is a solid and the NMR doesn't have broad peaks.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So substitution would not give that. Then it must be elimination leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the base causes the formation of a carbonyl by dehydrohalogenation. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, elimination can form a carbonyl if the two X atoms are on adjacent carbons, but in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—the Brs are on carbons that are two apart. Wait, maybe when the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination can form a double bond, but perhaps if the structure is such that elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move to the next step to see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But in this case, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, the starting material is treated with KOH, not PCl5 or something.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, so when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation if the substrate is an aromatic ring, but adamantane is not aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like AlCl3, it can activate it for certain reactions, but in this case, with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts catalyst for alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. Maybe product 2 is a more complex structure, perhaps forming an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, let me go back to product 1's NMR.

The NMR shows:
- 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet)
- 1.94 (2H, singlet?)

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O. But then, a singlet for 2H would suggest no neighboring protons. Or maybe it's a bridgehead structure.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's an adamantanone. So the structure is an adamantane ring with a ketone group. For example, 1-adamantanone.

If that's the case, then the NMR would show the ketone's adjacent protons. Let me think about the structure. 1-adamantanone has a bridgehead carbonyl. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.3-2.4 ppm. Then, the bridgehead protons might be around 1.94 ppm as a singlet, perhaps. The 4.79 ppm peak is a bit puzzling. Maybe it's not the ketone but something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an alkyne. But I don't see an IR peak for a triple bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, but the IR doesn't show broad peaks for OH.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of product 1 as 1,3-adamantadiene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl in IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material loses two HBr to form a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group. Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination. Wait, pinacol is a vicinal diol that eliminates water to form a ketone. But in this case, we have a dihalide eliminating HBr.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's say the structure is 1,3-diketone? No, but that's not possible from dihalide elimination.

Wait, another approach: looking for the IR peak. 1720 cm-1 is a strong, medium-intensity peak for a ketone. So, product 1 is a ketone.

So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe a neighboring group participation or some kind of elimination leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to the bridgehead. So when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, the Br leaves, forming a carbocation, which then could lose another Br and form a carbonyl via deprotonation.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl. For example, each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead. So when the H is abstracted and Br leaves, the adjacent carbon (bridgehead) would have a positive charge. But that might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination where two HBr are lost, and the two carbons where Br was attached form a double bond and a carbonyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, forming two double bonds, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a rearrangement. For example, a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's for carbocations.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that product 1 is a ketone and move on. So product 1 is, say, 1-adamantanone.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is the result of some acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, and you use a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane is not aromatic. Hmm. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of enol formation or enolate formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could be undergoing a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically uses a peracid. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps product 1 is not a ketone but an ester. But no, the IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkylated version of product 1. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, and aluminum isopropoxide is used to form an enol ether or something.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but earlier I thought the NMR didn't fit an epoxide.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkylated product from product 1. Let's suppose product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product 3. Let's see. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So, product 3 would come from the cleavage of a double bond in product 2.

So, if product 3 is formed by ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 must have a double bond, which comes from product 1. So, product 1 must have a double bond, which is then transformed into something else in product 2.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone, so product 2 can't have a double bond unless product 1 undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but I thought product 1 is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Ozonolysis is used on double bonds, not epoxides. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, product 2 must have a double bond. How could product 1, which is a ketone, become a compound with a double bond upon treatment with aluminum isopropoxide?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and under the influence of a Lewis acid, it loses water to form a double bond. But then product 1 would have to be a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne, but I don't see that in the data.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ether, but again, not matching the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Then, product 2 could be some addition across the double bond, but then ozonolysis would break that into smaller fragments.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diene in product 1, which under Lewis acid conditions forms a dienol or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether after elimination.

Wait, but product 1's NMR doesn't show OH peaks, so product 1 isn't a diol.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR at 1720 cm-1 → likely a ketone).

2. Product 1 → product 2 (heated with Al(OiPr)3).

3. Product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis followed by work-up).

Product 3's NMR is the focus.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2's double bond.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have a functional group that can form a double bond when treated with Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, what reactions form double bonds using a Lewis acid? Maybe a dehydrohalogenation or an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (conjugated enol). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a di-substituted ketone, perhaps treatment with a Lewis acid could cause it to form an enol ether, introducing a double bond adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent leaving group. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could cause an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, how would that happen? Perhaps a neighboring group could leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromoketone, but that doesn't seem right because the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, another angle: perhaps product 1 is a gem-dibromide, which upon treatment with KOH would eliminate HBr to form a carbonyl group. So, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, that's possible. So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enone.

How would that happen? Maybe through a elimination reaction. For example, if product 1 has a structure where a hydrogen and a bromide are adjacent to the carbonyl, then elimination could form a double bond next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, formed via elimination.

So, the steps would be:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → (with KOH) → product 1 (ketone).

2. Product 1 → (with Al(OiPr)3) → product 2 (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (two carbonyl compounds).

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would break the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups.

So, the ozonolysis of an enone would typically cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

Now, considering the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Since product 3 comes from ozonolysis, it must be an aldehyde or ketone, depending on the substitution.

But wait, ozonolysis of a symmetric double bond would give two identical carbonyls. For example, if the double bond is in the middle of a symmetric chain.

Wait, but product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Let's say product 2 is something like CH2=C(O)R.

Wait, no. Let's think of product 2 as having a double bond adjacent to the ketone. So, structure like RCOCH2CH2CH2CH2... but no, wait. More likely, it's RC=O-CH2-CH2-CH2..., but that's not right.

Wait, no. An alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone is R2C=CH-COR', perhaps.

Wait, perhaps product 2's structure is such that the ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. Then, the product 3 would have a structure that includes carbonyl groups, possibly with some hydrogen atoms adjacent.

But the NMR of product 3 is the focus. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyls.

In ozonolysis, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the double bond was between carbons A and B, ozonolysis would break it into A-O and B-O, each with carbonyl groups.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In the case of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the double bond is between carbons adjacent to the ketone. So, for instance, R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2- would have a double bond between the carbonyl and the next carbon. Wait, that's not the case. An alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone is R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, wait, it's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, no. It's R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, perhaps I should think of it as R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone, like (Z)- or (E)-stilbene ketone. So, when ozonolysis is performed, the double bond breaks, and each end becomes a carbonyl.

So, for example, if product 2 was CH2=C(O)R, ozonolysis would break it into two fragments, each with a carbonyl.

But in any case, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's think about the splitting pattern.

In ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups, and any hydrogens adjacent would be split based on neighboring protons.

But in product 3, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-R-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group near the aldehyde would have neighboring protons. But wait, aldehydes don't have hydrogens adjacent—they're at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's just a guess.

Wait, another possibility: product 3 could be a diketone, with each ketone group adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the CH2 groups would have neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, let's imagine the structure as R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, like 1,4-dien-3-one. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but 1,4-dien-3-one has conjugated double bonds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is 1,3-dien-2-one. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a single double bond adjacent to a ketone, such as cinnamaldehyde (but that's an aldehyde, not a ketone). So, perhaps a structure like R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but without a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 2 is something like cyclohexenone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, but cyclohexenone would give two diketones, which might not be correct.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a more substituted enone, like (E)- or (Z)-4-penten-2-one. Ozonolysis of that would give two carbonyls.

So, for (E)-4-penten-2-one, ozonolysis would break the double bond between C2 and C3, giving two fragments: one from C1-C2 and the other from C3-C4-C5. So, the products would be formaldehyde and something else.

Wait, no. Let me think: 4-penten-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2. No, wait. 4-penten-2-one structure is CH2=C(CH2COCH3)CH2. No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of 4-penten-2-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Let me write it:

Structure: CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Ozonolysis of this would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the two products would be formaldehyde (from the CH2=) and another fragment.

Wait, but the actual structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis would cleave between the double bond, so the products would be formaldehyde (from CH2=) and a ketone from the other end.

Wait, perhaps the products would be formaldehyde and (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH3, which is pentan-3-one.

But I'm not exactly sure. But in any case, the NMR of product 3 would show the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

In the case of a carbonyl group, the adjacent hydrogens (if any) would typically be split based on neighboring protons. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have neighboring H's on the same CH2, leading to a quartet (if two neighboring H's) or a triplet (if only one neighboring H).

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, the splitting could get more complex.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-O=C-R'. The CH2 groups would be next to carbonyls and perhaps have neighboring H's.

But perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is also adjacent to another CH2 group.

So, for example, a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-R.

Wait, but more accurately, the splitting would involve coupling with adjacent hydrogens. Let's imagine a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. The central CH2 would be adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, let's take a simple case. Suppose we have a structure where a CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2. The central CH2 would have neighboring H's on both sides, leading to a triplet of triplets or some such splitting.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is a molecule like CH2(CO)CH2COCH3. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH3. Wait, but that would be a geminal di-ketone, which is not possible. So, perhaps it's CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure like (CH3)2CO and another carbonyl compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is two aldehydes or ketones connected via a chain. For example, OHC-CH2-CHO. But that's a possibility.

Wait, assuming product 3 has a CH2 group between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then the middle CH2 would be next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons.

So, the central CH2 would have neighboring H's on both sides. Each neighboring CH2 would have two H's, leading to coupling with each set. So, each H on the central CH2 would couple with the two H's on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two H's. So, the central CH2 would have two neighboring groups: one on the left (a CH2 with two H's) and one on the right (another CH2 with two H's).

Each H on the central CH2 would couple with the two H's on the left and the two on the right. That would result in each H having (n+1)(m+1) peaks, where n and m are the number of H's on each adjacent group.

Wait, more precisely, each H on the central CH2 would have coupling with the two H's on the left CH2 and the two H's on the right CH2.

So, for each H, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but considering that each adjacent group has two H's, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps each H on the central CH2 would have coupling with two H's from the left and two from the right. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, resulting in nine peaks. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But looking back at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if the coupling is with two different sets of two H's each, each H would split into a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets (nine peaks, but perhaps simplified in the NMR into a multiplet). But the question specifies the coupling pattern, so the answer would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen (likely adjacent to a carbonyl) would be part of a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups, each with two H's. Thus, each H on that CH2 would couple with two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between a carbonyl and another CH2 group, leading to coupling with only one set of two H's, resulting in a triplet.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the ozonolysis product. If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, perhaps it's something like CH2=C(CO-R)R'. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if product 2 is CH2=C(COCH3)2, then ozonolysis would split it into two formaldehyde molecules and a COCH3 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, like 1,3-diketone with a double bond in between. For example, CH2=C(CO-R)CH2CO-R'. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups.

But perhaps product 3 would have a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyls, leading to each CH2 hydrogen being split by adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to two carbonyls. So, each H on that CH2 would be next to two H's on adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would split into a triplet (from one adjacent CH2) and another triplet (from the other), resulting in a triplet of triplets.

That would correspond to option B.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Formation of Product 1**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, the IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a ketone. The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone such as 1-adamantanone. The ¹H NMR spectrum supports this, with peaks consistent with a ketone structure.

2. **Formation of Product 2**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces an elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone). The double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group is introduced during this step.

3. **Formation of Product 3**:  
   Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by work-up with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the α,β-unsaturated ketone, producing two carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl group is flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens. Each hydrogen on the central CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a splitting pattern of a triplet of triplets for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
