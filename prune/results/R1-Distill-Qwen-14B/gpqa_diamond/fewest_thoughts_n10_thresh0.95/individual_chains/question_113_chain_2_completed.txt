--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each of these will help determine the chemical formula among the options provided.

First, I'll start by breaking down each piece of information.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR spectrum usually indicate O-H stretching. Alcohols, for example, have broad peaks because the O-H bonds can stretch and vibrate in many ways. So this suggests the compound has an -OH group, which would account for one of the oxygens in the formula.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 peak is typical for a ketone or an aldehyde, maybe an ester too. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something like a conjugated carbonyl group or perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Wait, but wait, if there are two peaks, maybe there are two different carbonyl groups, or maybe one is an amide or another functional group. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, but I don't see any peaks in the aromatic region (like around 3000-3100 for C-H stretching in aromatics) mentioned here. Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, maybe part of a conjugated system or just an isolated double bond. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene group in the structure.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments could give this. 45 is a common m/z value for certain functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7⁺) is at 91, so that's not it. Maybe a carbonyl fragment? Wait, 45 could be the (CH2)2CO⁺ fragment or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the (OCH2)2CO+ or another group. Wait, 45 is also the mass for a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. Let me think about possible formulas. For example, CH3COOH has a formula weight of 60, but that's not a fragment. Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is (acetone), but acetone is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight 58. Hmm, not 45. Wait, maybe a smaller fragment. 45 could be CH3COO (which would be 59, no). Or perhaps a COCH2CH2+ fragment? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2CH2O) group? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Each of these has different degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate that.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Since there's no X (halogens) or N mentioned, we'll ignore them.

For each option:

Option A: C6H12O
C=6, H=12, O=2? Wait, no, the formula is C6H12O. So O=1.

Wait, the options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So each option's formula:

A: C6H12O2 → C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14 -12)/2 → 2/2 → 1.

Wait, wait, let me calculate again. DoU = (2C +2 - H - X)/2, but since O is present, it's (2C +2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2. Wait, I think I might have confused the formula. The correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But since O is not directly counted as X, but for each O, it's subtracted as 2O. Wait, no, the formula is:

DoU = [2C +2 - H - X + N - 2P]/2, where P is the number of phosphorus atoms, etc., but in this case, we can ignore all except C, H, O. So each O contributes 2 towards the hydrogen count, but in the formula, it's handled as subtracting 2O from the total.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But since X and N are zero, and O is not part of X, then:

DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

Wait, but O doesn't factor into this. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: each degree of unsaturation is equivalent to one ring or double bond. Each O in the molecule contributes to the number of H in the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the DoU for each formula.

Let me think for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2.

The general formula for organic compounds is CnH2nOx.

But for a molecule with O, the H count is H = 2n + 2 - 2*(O) (but only for some cases). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2 - O

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should use the standard way.

The standard formula for degrees of unsaturation is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

But O does not directly affect this calculation. Wait, no, that's not right. Because oxygen can influence the structure, but not the calculation of DoU as per the formula. Wait, perhaps O is treated as part of the structure, but not as a substituent for DoU.

Wait, I found that the correct formula is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

But O is not considered in this formula. So for each molecule, regardless of O, the DoU is calculated without considering O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because O can form double bonds or rings as well. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think in terms of hydrogen deficiency.

Each DoU is equivalent to one double bond or ring.

The formula for hydrogen deficiency is:

Hydrogen Deficiency = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But O is not included in this formula because each O can contribute to a double bond (like in carbonyl groups), but they are already accounted for in the structure.

Wait, maybe I should just calculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

C=6, H=12, O=2.

Hydrogen Deficiency = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 → (14 -12)/2 → 2/2=1.

So 1 DoU.

Which could be one ring and no double bonds, or one double bond and no rings, or a combination.

Option B: C6H10O.

Hydrogen Deficiency = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2 →4/2=2.

So two DoU's.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Hydrogen Deficiency = (14 -10)/2 →2 DoU's.

Option D: C6H12O.

Hydrogen Deficiency= (14-12)/2=1.

So the options have varying DoU's.

Now, looking at the data from the IR.

The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H group, perhaps an alcohol or a phenol, but phenol's O-H is usually broader and around 3000-3200. But let's not get stuck here; moving on.

The 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ peaks. So two carbonyl groups? Or a conjugated system? Let's think: 1700 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated. If there's an ester group, the carbonyl is typically around 1740, but if it's conjugated, it might be lower. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring with a substituent, but without an absorption in the aromatic C-H region, I'm not so sure.

Wait, but if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would be two DoU's. Because each carbonyl is a double bond. So two double bonds would add up to two DoU's.

So looking at the options, which have two DoU's? Options B and C.

Wait, let's check:

Option B: C6H10O → DoU=2.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

So either could have two DoU's. If the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, which would account for two DoU's.

Then, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests another double bond. Wait, but wait: each vinyl group is a double bond, so each would contribute a DoU. But if the compound already has two DoU's from two carbonyl groups, adding a double bond would make it three DoU's. But looking at the options, none have three DoU's. Because option A has DoU=1, B and C have 2, D has 1.

Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, in the IR, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be from a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would mean one carbonyl and one double bond, so two DoU's. So that would fit with options B and C (each having two DoU's).

So the compound could have a structure with a conjugated carbonyl and an alkene. That would account for two DoU's.

Additionally, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene, which is one DoU. But earlier, the two carbonyls would account for two DoU's. Wait, but that can't be because two carbonyls would require two DoU's, and the alkene would be a third. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's think: each carbonyl is a double bond. So carbonyl groups contribute to the DoU. The same for each double bond.

So if the compound has a conjugated system (one double bond and one carbonyl), that's two DoU's. But the presence of a vinyl group (another double bond) would add another DoU, making three. But the options don't have any compounds with three DoU's. So perhaps this line of thinking is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the two IR peaks are from two different types of carbonyl groups. For example, an ester (higher wavenumber, around 1740) and a ketone (lower, around 1700). Wait, but in the case of conjugated systems, the carbonyl peak shifts down. Alternatively, maybe an ester and an amide, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is from an aromatic ring, but I don't see any C-H stretches in the aromatic region mentioned. The IR data given includes a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), and two carbonyls. So perhaps the compound is a diester or something with two carbonyl groups.

But let's move on to the mass spectrometry data. The fragment at m/z=45. What's 45 in terms of possible fragments?

45 could correspond to a (CH3CO) group. Let me calculate: CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43 (C=12, H3=3, C=12, O=16; 12+3 +12 +16 = 43). But 45 is 2 more than that. Alternatively, maybe it's the fragment (CH2CH2O) or something else.

Wait, another approach: The molecular ion peak could be at a certain m/z, but the question gives a fragment. So the fragment at 45 suggests a part of the molecule. Let's see what formula corresponds to a molecular weight of 45.

45 could be C3H7O2 (3*12 +7*1 +16*2=36+7+32=75 → no). Alternatively, C3H6O (3*12 +6*1 +16=36+6+16=58 → no). Or perhaps C2H5O2 (2*12 +5*1 +32=24+5+32=61→no). Hmm, not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something like OCH2CH2O+ but that's probably not. Another possibility: a ketene ion (R2C=O+), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula given could help. Let's think about each option and what fragments they could produce.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. In mass spec, possible fragments could be breaking off a group. For example, losing a water molecule (18) would give 98. But the fragment is at 45. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller group breaks off. 45 is 116 - 71 = 45? Not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98. So a fragment of 45 would be possible if part of the molecule breaks off. Like, maybe CH2CH2O or something.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. A fragment of 45 would be 114 -69=45, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100. So a fragment of 45 could be possible.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think what gives a fragment of 45. Another approach: what is the molecular formula of a possible fragment with molecular weight 45?

45 = 12a +1b +16c, where a is number of C, b H, c O.

Looking for integer solutions:

Let me try a=3: 3*12=36. 45-36=9. So 9=1b +16c. Possible c=0 → b=9. So C3H9. But H can't be 9 for a neutral fragment; maybe c=0 is not possible. Alternatively, c=0: C3H9O? No, because 3*12 +9 +0=45. So C3H9O would have a molecular weight of 3*12 +9 +16=36+9+16=61. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps a=2: 2*12=24. 45-24=21. 21=1b +16c.

Looking for c where 16c ≤21. So c can be 1 → 16, leaving 5. So 5= b → b=5. So C2H5O.

But C2H5O: molecular weight is 24 +5 +16=45. So the formula is C2H5O. That would be something like an ethyl hydroxide group? Or maybe a fragment like OCH2CH3, which is an ethyl group attached to O, but that's 45.

Wait, OCH2CH3 is (CH2CH3O), which would have a molecular weight of 16 + 12 + 12 + 3 + 1 = 16 +24 +4 = 44? Wait, no:

O is 16, CH2CH3 is 12*2 + 1*5 (because CH2CH3 has two carbons, each with two H in CH2 and three in CH3: but when considering the fragment as OCH2CH3, that's 1 O, 2 C, 5 H. So molecular weight is 16 + (2*12) +5*1=16+24+5=45. Right! So a fragment of OCH2CH3 (45) would be consistent.

In which case, the original compound must have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) or something that could fragment into that.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion or something else, but the ethoxy fragment seems plausible.

So if the compound has an ethoxy group, that would imply an OCH2CH3 group, which is an ether or part of an ester.

But let me tie this back to the other data.

The IR shows two carbonyls, so the compound probably has two carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone, or two ester groups, or maybe a beta-diketone.

Wait, but if the compound has an ester group, the IR would show a carbonyl around 1740 cm⁻¹, but our IR shows 1700 and 1650. So maybe the ester is conjugated, which lowers the carbonyl peak. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an acid anhydride, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, the compound could have a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So that would have a carbonyl at around 1700 and a conjugated double bond, with the C=C peak around 1650 cm⁻¹. But then where does the other carbonyl come in? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two carbonyl peaks are from two different groups. For example, a ketone (1700) and an ester (lower, say 1700? Or maybe a conjugated ester might be lower). Or maybe an acid and a ketone, but the acid would have a broad peak around 2500-3000 for the -COOH group, which isn't mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl is from an ester and the other from an amide, but that seems complicated, and I don't see any NMR signals that would suggest an amide.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are not both carbonyls. Maybe one is a carbonyl and another is a conjugated double bond. Wait, but the 1650 peak is more in line with a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 cm⁻¹ is not a carbonyl but a C=C stretch. The C=C stretch is usually around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. So if there's a C=C in the molecule, that would explain the 1650 peak, and the 1700 would be a carbonyl.

So that would mean the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a double bond (C=C), giving two DoU's. Plus, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would correspond to that double bond.

So putting this together: the compound has a ketone (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (1650 cm⁻¹), plus an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹). So possible structures could be something like a cyclohexenone with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

But let's think about the molecular formula options again.

If the compound has a ketone (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that's two DoU's. So options B and C have two DoU's.

Option B is C6H10O.

Option C is C6H10O2.

So which one fits better with the data?

The IR has a broad O-H, which suggests an alcohol group, so oxygen count would be at least one. So option B has one O, which would fit an alcohol. Option C has two O's, perhaps an alcohol and another group, or two ester groups.

Wait, but the mass spectrum has a fragment at 45, which we thought might be OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether group). So the molecular formula would have to include an OCH2CH3 group.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: C6H10O.

If the formula is C6H10O, and it has an OCH2CH3 group, then the rest is C4H7O. Hmm, but let me count:

OCH2CH3 is C2H5O.

So the remaining part would be C4H5 (since 6-2 =4 C's, and 10-5=5 H's, considering the OCH2CH3 has 5 H's (if it's OCH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H's). So the remaining would be C4H5. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a different part.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula.

Option C is C6H10O2.

If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45), then the molecular formula would have (OCH2CH3) as part of it. So the rest would be C4H7O.

Wait, OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. So the molecular formula would be C2H5O plus the rest.

So the total formula would be C2H5O + something else. Let me see for option C: C6H10O2.

If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), then the other part is C4H5O. Because 6-2=4 C's, 10-5=5 H's, 2-1=1 O. So C4H5O.

But how does that fit into the structure? Maybe the compound is something like (CH2CH3O) attached to a C4H5O group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the mass spectrum fragment might not be the ethyl group but another group. Let's think about other possibilities.

Another possibility for m/z=45 is CH3COO (which would be 43), but that's close. Maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentose fragment, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone group. For example, a (CH3)2CO+ would be (acetone) with a molecular weight of 58, which is not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a methyl ester group. But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Let me think about the IR data again. We have two carbonyl peaks, a broad O-H, and vinyl H's.

Looking at the options, which ones have two oxygen atoms? Options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

If the compound has two O's, perhaps it's a diol, but then the IR would show two O-H stretches, but the problem states only a very broad peak at 3000. Alternatively, perhaps an ester and an alcohol. But an ester would have two O's.

Wait, wait. An ester functional group has the formula R-O-CO-R', which contributes two O's. So in the molecular formula, that would account for two O's. So if the compound is an ester, that would mean option A (C6H12O2) or option C (C6H10O2).

But if it's an ester, the IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1740 cm⁻¹, but our IR shows 1700 and 1650. That's lower than a typical ester, so maybe it's a conjugated ester, which would have a lower wavenumber. Alternatively, perhaps it's a lactone, but that's a cyclic ester and might not change the wavenumber significantly.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, which would have two carbonyl groups. So in that case, the IR would show two peaks, one for the ketone (around 1700) and one for the ester (lower, maybe around 1700 as well, but perhaps shifted down due to conjugation). But I'm not sure.

Back to the mass spec: if the fragment is 45, which is OCH2CH3, that would suggest an ethoxy group. So the compound could be an ester with an ethoxy group. For instance, an ethyl ester.

So if it's an ethyl ester, the formula would include an OCH2CH3 group. Let's see:

Assuming the compound is an ester, which would be R-O-CO-R', where R is ethyl (C2H5). Then, the other part R' would be something else.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then R' would be C4H5O (since R is C2H5O, and R' is (6-2)=4 C, and (10 - (5 + (3 from OCO))) wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the ester would have the formula RCOOR', where R is an alkyl group and R' is another.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then RCOOR' would be:

RCOOR' → R is (say) C3H5, R' is C2H5.

Because RCOOR' would have (3+2) =5 C's, but the formula is C6, so perhaps another carbon elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structures: ester, ketone, or perhaps a diester.

If it's an ester, the formula would likely be RCOOR', which contributes two O's.

For example, if R is C3H5 and R' is C2H5, the formula would be C5H10O2, which is less than our target. So perhaps R is C4H7 and R' is C1H3 (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, but the problem doesn't mention any aromatic signals in the NMR, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups: one ketone and one ester. So the structure would be RCOCOR', which would account for two O's.

So for example, if R is CH2 and R' is CH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula: C6H10O2.

If it's a beta-keto ester, the structure would be (CH2)nCO-CO-O-R. Wait, no, beta-keto ester is RCO-COOR'.

So for RCO-COOR', the formula would be R is (say) methyl (CH3), and R' is ethyl (CH2CH3). Then the formula would be CH3CO-COOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the molecular formula.

CH3CO-COOCH2CH3 → that's (CH3)2COOCH2CH3. Wait, no. The beta-keto ester would be CH2(CO)COOCH2CH3? Wait, perhaps not. Let me recount:

The beta-keto ester structure is R-CO-COOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. So if R is methyl (CH3) and R' is ethyl (CH2CH3), the formula would be:

CH3-CO-COO-CH2CH3 → So that's:

Carbon: 3 (from CH3) + 2 (from CO) + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from CH2CH3) → 3 + 2 + 2 + 2=9 carbons? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try again.

A beta-keto ester would have the structure: 

O
||
O-C-O
   ||
   C-R

Wait, no. The correct structure is RCO-COOR'. So R is attached to the first carbonyl, then another carbonyl connected to the ester group.

So for R = CH2CH3 and R' = CH3, the formula would be CH2CH2CO-CO-OCH3. But regardless, let's count the carbons.

If the formula is C6H10O2:

The ester group contributes 3 O's (the carbonyl, the ether oxygen, and the ester oxygen?), wait no. The ester group is O-CO-O, but in reality, it's RCOOR', which has two O's: one in the carbonyl and one in the ether.

Wait, RCOOR' would have:

R: n carbons

COOR': 2 carbons (COO) and m carbons (R')

So total carbons: n + 2 + m =6.

Hydrogens: The R group would contribute 2n+1 (if R is (CH2)nCH3), and the R' would contribute 2m+1. But let's not get stuck on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, but I don't have enough data.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-ester, but that would require more oxygen.

Hmm. Let me try to connect all the data.

The IR has a broad peak (O-H), two carbonyl peaks (so either two carbonyl groups or a conjugated system), and the presence of vinyl H's (a double bond).

The mass spec has a fragment at 45, which we thought could be OCH2CH3.

So the molecular formula must have OCH2CH3 as a part of it.

Looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O → If OCH2CH3 is part of it, the rest would be C4H7. But C4H7 is a possible formula (like 1-butene or similar). But I'm not sure how that would fit into a structure with two carbonyl groups.

Option C: C6H10O2 → If OCH2CH3 is part of it, the rest would be C4H5O. Not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment might not be OCH2CH3 but something else.

Wait, another thought: The molecular ion (M) in mass spec is the molecular weight. The fragment at 45 is a daughter ion. So the molecular weight must be higher than 45.

Looking at the options:

A: 116 → M=116.

B: 98 → M=98.

C: 114 → M=114.

D: 100 → M=100.

So all of them are higher than 45. So a fragment of 45 is possible.

In mass spectrometry, common fragments are methyl groups (15), ethyl (29), but in this case, 45 suggests a larger fragment.

Another approach: the molecular formula of the compound could be C6H10O2. Let's think about that. How many degrees of unsaturation does that have?

As calculated before, DoU for C6H10O2 is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoU's, which could be two double bonds, two rings, or one of each.

If the compound has two carbonyl groups (like an ester and a ketone), that's two DoU's. Plus, the presence of a double bond would add another DoU, which would make it three. But according to the options, the DoU is two, so perhaps the two carbonyl groups account for two DoU's. Then, the vinyl H's must come from a double bond that is part of a conjugated system, perhaps with one of the carbonyls.

Wait, but that would require three DoU's. So this is getting confusing.

Let me think again about the IR. The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ could be from an aromatic ring. Oh wait, aromatic C=C absorbs around 1600 cm⁻¹, but that's a region different from the 1700 area. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a C=C in an aromatic ring. But then we'd expect aromatic C-H stretches around 3000-3100 cm⁻¹, which the problem doesn't mention. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure.

In that case, the structure would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group, giving two DoU's (one for the double bond, one for the carbonyl). Then the O-H group adds another feature but doesn't add a DoU.

So in that case, the molecular formula would have two DoU's, which fits options B and C.

So if the structure is a conjugated enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone), that would explain the 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ peaks.

Additionally, the presence of vinyl H's in the NMR would correspond to the double bond in the enone.

Putting this together, the formula must have two DoU's, which is options B and C.

Now, the O-H group suggests either an alcohol or another O-containing group. If the compound is a conjugated enone with an alcohol group, the formula would have one O (if it's an alcohol), which would correspond to option B (C6H10O). But if the compound is an ester or another O-containing group, it would have two O's (option C).

Wait, but the ester group would have two O's, and the O-H suggests another O, which would make three O's. But option C only has two O's. So perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol and the other O is part of a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of an ester. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the compound has an ester group (two O's) and an alcohol group (another O), but that would require three O's, which isn't in any of the options. So perhaps the O-H is part of a ketone? No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a carbonyl group, but that's not feasible.

So perhaps the O-H is an alcohol, which would mean one O. Then the other O comes from a carbonyl group, such as a ketone or ester. But if the carbonyl is part of an ester, that would require two O's. Wait, an ester has the structure R-O-CO-R', which includes two O's.

So if the compound has an ester group, that would account for two O's. Plus, the O-H would be a third O, which isn't present in any of the options except perhaps option C, which has two O's. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 is probably from a group with a molecular weight of 45. So, if the compound is a diether, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, another approach: look for the options and see which one can have a fragment at 45.

Looking at option C: C6H10O2.

If it's a diester, the formula would be something like RCOOR'COOR''. But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would have one O.

Wait, another thought: The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens.

If the compound is an ester, it would have the structure RCOOR', which contributes two O's. Then, the remaining part would be R and R' making up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups and one O from the ester, but that would give two O's. So, for example, the structure would be RCOCOOR', which has two carbonyls and one ester O. Wait, but that's two O's in the structure. So the molecular formula would be (R) is, say, CH2, and (R') is CH2CH2.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula. Suppose the structure is CH2CO-COOCH2CH3.

So that's (CH2CO) as R and (OCH2CH3) as R'.

The formula would be:

CH2CO → C2H3O?

Wait, no. Let me count:

CH2CO is CH2-CO, which is C2H3O?

Wait, no. CH2CO is actually CH2-CO, which is C2H3O? No, CO is O, but CH2CO is C2H3O? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-COOCH2CH3. Let's count:

CH3CO is C2H3O.

COOCH2CH3 is C3H5O2.

Wait, adding them up:

CH3CO-COOCH2CH3 would be C5H8O3. But the formula is C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is different.

Wait, another approach: for the fragment at 45, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and a fragment is 45 (C2H5O), the rest of the formula would be C4H5O. So the compound could be something like OCH2CH3 attached to a C4H5O group. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a cyclopentene ring. But I don't know.

At this point, I think I've thought through most of the possibilities, and perhaps it's time to make an educated guess based on the data.

The IR suggests the presence of an -OH group, two carbonyls, and a double bond. The NMR has vinyl H's, which is the double bond. The mass spec suggests a fragment that could be an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. This would allow for two O's, possibly from an ester group and an -OH. But wait, if the molecule has both an ester and an -OH, that would require three oxygens, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two ester groups, but that's stretching it.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, but that would only have one O.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are from an ester and a ketone, which would require two O's.

If the compound is an ester (O from the ester) and a ketone (O from the carbonyl), but wait, no, the ketone doesn't contribute an additional O beyond the carbonyl.

Wait, no. The ketone has a carbonyl group (C=O), which doesn't add an O beyond what's already in the molecule.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible answers.

The correct answer is likely option C, C6H10O2.

Because:

- The IR shows two carbonyls, which could be from an ester and a ketone, contributing to two O's.

- The O-H group would come from an alcohol, but wait, that would require a third O, which isn't present. So perhaps the O-H is from a different group, like a phenol (but that would require aromatic C-H stretches, which aren't mentioned).

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, and the other O comes from an ester or ketone. Wait, but that would require three O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

The NMR shows vinyl H's, which implies a double bond. The IR shows two carbonyls. So two DoU's. That points to options B and C.

If the compound has two carbonyls and a double bond, that would be three DoU's, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Wait, no. Each carbonyl counts as a DoU, and the double bond as another, totaling three DoU's, which isn't present in any option except maybe if the formula is C6H8O2, but that's not an option.

So perhaps the two carbonyls are part of the same group, like a conjugated system, which is one DoU, and the double bond is another. So that gives two DoU's, which fits options B and C.

So with that, the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) and a double bond elsewhere, which might not be the case. Alternatively, the double bond is part of the conjugated system, making it only one DoU.

Wait, no, a conjugated system (double bond and carbonyl) counts as one DoU for each. Or is it considered as one DoU because they're conjugated? Wait, no, each double bond or ring counts as one DoU, regardless of conjugation.

So a conjugated diene would have two double bonds, thus two DoU's.

But in our case, the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, which are separate. So perhaps the compound has two separate carbonyl groups, each contributing a DoU.

But then the double bond would add another DoU, making three, which isn't present.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's look for the answer.

After considering all the data, the correct answer is likely option C: C6H10O2.

Because:

- The two carbonyl groups (two DoU's) could account for the IR peaks.

- The O-H group suggests an alcohol or another O-containing group.

- The vinyl H's suggest a double bond, which would add a DoU, but if the two carbonyls are part of a conjugated system, they might only count as one DoU. Alternatively, the vinyl H's are part of a conjugated system, so it doesn't add another DoU.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups and one O from the ester, but that would give two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, which would account for two DoU's.

In that case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So after all this, I think the answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The data provided is as follows:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or phenol.  
   - Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of two carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is consistent with a ketone or ester, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could indicate a conjugated carbonyl group or a C=C stretch.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens suggest the presence of a double bond (C=C).

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 was observed. This is consistent with a fragment such as OCH₂CH₃ (ethyl group attached to oxygen), which has a molecular weight of 45.

### Analysis of the Options:
The molecular formula options are:  
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
The DoU for each option was calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H)}{2}
\]
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1  

#### Key Observations:
- The IR spectrum indicates two carbonyl groups, which contribute two DoU's.  
- The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, which would add another DoU. However, the total DoU for the compound must match the molecular formula.  
- The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (OCH₂CH₃), which is consistent with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

#### Elimination of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has only one DoU, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups and the double bond.  
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Similarly, this formula has only one DoU, which is inconsistent with the data.  
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: While this formula has two DoU's, it only contains one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has two DoU's, which can account for the two carbonyl groups. Additionally, the presence of two oxygen atoms aligns with the IR data, and the fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with an ethoxy group.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data.
