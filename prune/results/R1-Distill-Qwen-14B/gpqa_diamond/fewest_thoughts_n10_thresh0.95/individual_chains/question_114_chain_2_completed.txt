Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let's break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, I'm thinking of the typical nucleophilic addition to a ketone. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the ketone would react with the cyanide nucleophile.

But wait, I remember that when you add a cyanide to a ketone, you usually get an addition product. But what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So the molecule would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that's also attached to two methyl groups and an OH group. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because nitriles are usually on the end. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon. So the initial product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, that seems different from the product given. Oh wait, maybe there's more happening. Oh! Because when you add a strong base like NaCN, it's possible that the reaction doesn't stop there. Wait, perhaps it's a case of a subsequent reaction.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a nitrile is formed via addition to a ketone, an intramolecular reaction can happen. Like, maybe after the cyanide adds, there's an elimination step or something else. Or perhaps, wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN and another reagent A gives a hydroxy nitrile. Wait, hydroxy nitriles are a specific thing. Oh wait, the product has a hydroxyl and nitrile on the same carbon. So, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, but then maybe there's a rearrangement.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be CH2(C(OH)CN)(CH3)2? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, including the nitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is: (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but that's not possible because butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on C4. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)–CH2CN? No, wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should think about the reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN: the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, giving (CH3)2C(O^-)CN. Then, perhaps it would protonate. But wait, in the presence of an acid, maybe that would lead to a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe after the initial addition, another step occurs, like tautomerism or something else.

Wait, but I remember that the addition of a cyanide to a ketone can form a cyanohydrin. Oh! Right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a hydroxyl and nitrile group are added across the carbonyl. So, for example, adding HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin. But in this case, it's NaCN which is a source of CN-; perhaps in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ as a catalyst, the CN- acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, so the general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But to form that, you usually need an acid catalyst. So for butan-2-one and NaCN, perhaps reagent A is H3O+ (acid). That would make sense. So A is H3O+. That would explain the first reaction.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about. So for the first reaction, the right A is H3O+, so we can narrow it down to options A or B.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, this is the second step. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, and it's being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But what's the typical reagent for that? Usually, strong acid and heat, like with H2SO4 and heat, or using HCl in aqueous conditions, or maybe a two-step process with different catalysts.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So, 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would have the structure CH2CH(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps the structure is (something else). Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the main chain is four carbons: the nitrile is on C4, the hydroxyl on C2, which is also attached to a 4-benzylphenyl group.

So when this nitrile is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to become a carboxylic acid, that suggests hydrolysis of the nitrile group. So the nitrile (CN) becomes a COOH group.

The hydrolysis of nitriles can proceed through different mechanisms. One common method is using a strong acid, like HCl, and heating, which would protonate the nitrile and eventually lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using aqueous H2O with some acid catalyst.

Wait, but for nitrile hydrolysis, I think HCl (in H2O) is a common reagent. For example, HCl in water (like HCl and heat) can convert nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, sometimes you use NaOH and H2O, but that typically leads to a carboxylate, which then needs acid work-up.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. So in the presence of H2O and perhaps an acid catalyst, the nitrile could hydrolyze. Alternatively, maybe reagent B is HCl (like in aqueous solution), which would act as a catalyst.

Wait, the question says the reagent is B (H2O). So in the second reaction, B is H2O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because H2O alone wouldn't hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, maybe I'm misreading. The question says reagent B is H2O, but that's the reaction condition. So the actual reagent for the reaction is B, which is H2O. So the reaction uses H2O as the solvent, but perhaps with an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So probably, the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions. So the reagent B in that case would be HCl or another strong acid in aqueous solution.

Looking at the options, the choices for B are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction: nitrile → carboxylic acid. So which reagent would do that? HCl in aqueous solution is a strong acid and heat. Alternatively, acetic acid is a weak acid. But to hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually need strong acidic conditions. So HCl is more likely.

Looking back at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, that fits. So for the second reaction, the correct reagent is HCl.

Putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second reaction, B is HCl (so options A or C). Wait, no, wait: looking at the options, each option gives A and B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So from the first reaction, we think A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second reaction, B is HCl (so options A and C). So the only option that has A = H3O+ and B=HCl is option A.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me think again about the first reaction. Are there any other possibilities for reagent A?

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. We thought that A is H3O+. But another possibility is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but how would NaHSO3 affect the reaction? NaHSO3 in water would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^- (which can act as an acid, donating H+ to become SO3^2- or H2O). So if A is NaHSO3, then it would provide an acidic environment. So perhaps similar to H3O+.

Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin. The formation of cyanohydrins typically requires an acid catalyst. So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 could act as acid catalysts. So which is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is a hydrocyanation. Wait, but hydrocyanation usually refers to adding HCN across a double bond, but here it's a ketone. So it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

So NaCN in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ or another acid, would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, forming the cyanohydrin.

So in that case, A could be either H3O+ or another acid like NaHSO3.

Wait, but the options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. So what's the difference in their use here?

H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid (HSO3^- is a weak acid, pKa around 1.8, so in solution, it can donate a proton but not as strongly as H3O+ which is essentially 100% dissociated in water).

But for the formation of the cyanohydrin, any acid would work. So whether H3O+ or NaHSO3, either could be a catalyst.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when the ketone is more hindered, certain conditions are preferred. But butan-2-one is not extremely hindered, so either acid might work.

But let me think about the options. If the first reaction's A is H3O+, then the second reaction's B is HCl. That would be option A.

But wait, the product of the first reaction is a hydroxy nitrile. Now, the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So after the first step, you have a nitrile that's adjacent to an alcohol group.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So during hydrolysis, the nitrile group becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

Typically, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions, like concentrated HCl and heat, or in aqueous acidic conditions. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH followed by acid work-up.

But in the options, the reagents are either HCl or acetic acid.

So for the second reaction, the correct reagent would be HCl (B=HCl), so option A or C.

But from the first reaction, we thought A is H3O+.

So the only option that has A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is a nitrile attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group.

So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you might have some complications. For example, if the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile, the hydrolysis could lead to a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

But in this case, the product is a hydroxy carboxylic acid. Wait no, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but that would require the -CN group to become a -COOH. So nitrile → carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis goes all the way to the acid.

So the conditions for that are strong acidic hydrolysis. So HCl in water is a typical reagent.

So putting it all together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction, an acid catalyst is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) and NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) can both act as catalysts. However, H₃O⁺ is more commonly used for such reactions, making it the likely choice for reagent A.

The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in aqueous solution. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is less suitable for this transformation. Therefore, HCl is the correct choice for reagent B.

From the options provided:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

Option A is the only one where A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl, which aligns with the requirements for both reactions.

Answer: A
