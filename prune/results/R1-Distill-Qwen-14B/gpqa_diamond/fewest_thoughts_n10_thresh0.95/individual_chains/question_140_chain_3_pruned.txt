Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. From what I understand, Substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and another substance B. When G is heated, B is released. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees above room temperature (since 273 K is 0°C). Also, a keto acid reacting with X gives a product with two oxygen atoms.

Hmm. Let's break it down piece by piece.

First, the reaction: X + Y → W (gas), G (precipitate), and B. When G is heated, it releases B. So, B is probably a decomposition product of G upon heating. Maybe G is a carbonate and B is CO2? Because when heated, carbonates decompose into CO2 and metal oxides. Wait, but B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think about what has a melting point around that.

Water (H2O) has a melting point of 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is about 4°C. Maybe B is water? Or another compound with a similar melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Hmm.

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So the molecule must be something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, if it's H2O, protons are 2 (from H2) + 8 (O) = 10. Neutrons in H2O: O has 8, each H has 0 (assuming protium). So total neutrons would be 8. But 10 protons and 8 neutrons don't match. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. Let's see: C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's the most common isotope, 12C), O each has 8 (16O). So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that's the same as protons. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That matches the condition. So W is CO2.

So gas W is carbon dioxide.

Now, looking back, X reacts with Y to produce CO2, precipitate G, and B. Also, when G is heated, it releases B. So if B is H2O, let's see.

Wait, but earlier I thought B's melting point is near 277 K. H2O freezes at 273 K, so 277 is close. So B is H2O.

So, the reaction could be between X and Y, which produces CO2, a precipitate G, and water. When G is heated, it releases H2O. So what's G? Maybe a carbonate. Because when carbonates are heated, they decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide. So maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it loses CO2 and becomes a metal oxide.

Wait, but the reaction is X reacting with Y to produce CO2 and a carbonate precipitate, and water. So Y must be a carbonate or perhaps something else. Let me think about what Y could be. It's a liquid. Hmm, common liquid in such reactions could be maybe H2O, but the product includes H2O. Alternatively, Y could be an acid. Let's think of a reaction where a carbonate reacts with an acid: CO3^2- + 2H+ → H2O + CO2↑. But in this case, X is reacting with Y. So perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid.

Wait, but the problem says X reacts with Y to release CO2. So if Y is H2SO4 or another strong acid, and X is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and the metal sulfate. But the precipitate would be the metal sulfate, which is not a carbonate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal bicarbonate, and Y is an acid. But that might not fit. Wait, maybe Y is H2O. Let's think. If X is a carbonate, and Y is water, but that might not react much. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitric acid or something. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is another component. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the reaction in another way.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. So if Y is, say, H2SO4, then the reaction would be X (like Na2CO3) + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + CO2↑. But in that case, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4? But sodium sulfate is soluble in water. So that's not a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the precipitate. The precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. So perhaps Y is a solution of a cation that, when reacts with X, forms an insoluble carbonate.

Wait, let's think: X is a carbonate, and Y is a solution of a metal ion that forms an insoluble carbonate when mixed. For example, if X is Na2CO3, and Y is CaCl2. Then mixing them would give CaCO3 precipitate (G), NaCl (which is soluble, so not a precipitate), and perhaps some other products. Wait, but the reaction would be Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → 2NaCl + CaCO3↓. So in this case, the precipitate G is CaCO3. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CO2, but wait earlier I thought B is H2O. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CaO? Wait, CaO's melting point is much higher than 277 K. CaO has a melting point around 2570 K. So that can't be. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try another approach.

The problem states that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two atoms of oxygen. Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. Examples include acetoacetic acid, which has the structure CH3COCH2COOH. Hmm, but when such a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something that adds oxygen or removes certain groups.

Wait, another thought: X could be a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7. These are commonly used in organic reactions.

Wait, but the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe X is something like H2O where one of the H's is deuterium (a heavier isotope). Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two oxygen atoms. But wait, if the product is CO2, then perhaps X is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid to CO2. But then, that would require a lot of oxygen, so maybe X is O2. But O2 is diatomic, and perhaps not incorporating a heavier isotope in a significant way. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative. Wait, perhaps X is an acid catalyst, but that may not fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible substances.

Substance X reacts with Y to produce CO2, a precipitate G, and B. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C. Hmm, what substances have a melting point near 4°C? Well, water (0°C, 273 K), but 277 K is about 4°C. Maybe B is NH3? No, NH3 boils at -33°C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is something like H2O (melting at 0°C) but the temperature given is a bit higher. Maybe it's another compound, like a hydrate? Or perhaps I'm thinking in the wrong direction.

Wait, another approach: what if X is a carbonate of a metal that forms a hydroxide upon heating. For example, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Let's say X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When it reacts with an acid (like H2SO4), it produces CO2, H2O, and sodium sulfate. But sodium sulfate is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. If X is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and the metal carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible options. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's consider the options given: options are 35,25,31,29. Hmm, these could correspond to some combinations.

Wait, if X is a carbonate, then the elements would be carbon, oxygen, and the metal. The lightest would be the metal (if it's something like sodium, which has atomic mass ~23) and the heaviest would be oxygen (16), but that's not matching the options. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, another thought: the product of the keto acid plus X has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids usually have a structure like R-CO-CH2-COOH. If X is something that adds an oxygen, perhaps it's an oxidizing agent. For example, oxidizing a secondary alcohol to ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The possible answers are 25,29,31,35. So the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's think about possible elements.

If X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is Na (23), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 39, not an option. Not matching.

If X is CaCO3, elements are Ca, C, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest Ca (40). Sum is 52. Not matching.

Wait, what if X is a nitrate? Let's say KNO3. Then the elements are K, N, O. Lightest is N (14), heaviest K (39). Sum is 53. No match.

Hmm. Maybe X is something with two elements, like NaOH. Then elements are Na and O and H. Wait, but the problem says 'lightest and heaviest elements present within X'. So for NaOH, elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. But option B is 25. Close, but no.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Let's think about Mg(OH)2. Then elements are Mg, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, which is approximately 25. Option B is 25. Hmm, that's a possibility.

But wait, let's see if this fits the reaction. Mg(OH)2 reacting with what? If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then Mg(OH)2 + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + 2H2O. So gas W would be H2O, but it's a liquid, not a gas. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate of magnesium, MgCO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce MgSO4, H2O, and CO2. So W would be CO2, which fits earlier analysis. The precipitate would be MgSO4? But MgSO4 is soluble in water. So that doesn't produce a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal that forms an insoluble carbonate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3. Then, X + Y → BaCO3 precipitate, NaNO3 (soluble), CO2, and H2O. So W is CO2, G is BaCO3. When BaCO3 is heated, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. So B would be CO2. But earlier I thought B's melting point is around 277 K, which is near 4°C. But CO2's melting point is about 217 K, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe B is something else.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the problem.

Another point: Substance X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and especially its analog. Common reagents in organic chemistry include NaOH, KOH, maybe KMnO4, etc. Wait, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. So if X is KMnO4, then Y could be something else. KMnO4 reacts with various substances, often in acidic conditions.

But KMnO4 is KMnO4, which has K, Mn, O. The lightest element is K (39?), wait no, Mn is atomic number 25, so atomic mass around 55. K is about 39, O is 16. So the heaviest is Mn, lightest is K? Wait no, K is heavier than Mn? Wait, no, Mn has a higher atomic number but K is lighter in mass. Let me check: K is about 39.1, Mn is about 54.94, O is 16. So in KMnO4, the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Mn (54.94). Sum is 70.94, which is not an option.

Hmm. Maybe X is NaOH. Then elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, which is close to option B (25). But why 25? Maybe the heavier isotope is considered. Wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So in NaOH, perhaps O is the element with a heavier isotope. Wait, but the sum is about 24, but the option is 25. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. No, but then it's a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Could that product be carbon dioxide (CO2), which has two O atoms? That would mean X is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid to CO2, releasing other products.

If X is a heavy isotope-containing substance, perhaps it's something like D2O (deuterium oxide), a heavier isotope of H2O. Then, when a keto acid reacts with D2O, perhaps in a reaction like oxidation, the product would have deuterium. But I'm not sure how that relates.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O, where one of the H's is deuterium. So X is HDO (or D2O). Then, when a keto acid reacts with it, perhaps the product incorporates D, but the problem states that the product has two O atoms. Maybe the product is D2O, but that's not relevant.

Wait, maybe the product is something else. If X is O2, a diatomic oxygen, but then the product would probably have more oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: the problem mentions that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, KMnO4, etc. Wait, what about H2O2? It's used as an oxidizing agent, but it's H and O.

But H2O2 has elements H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Wait, let's think about the reaction again. The product when a keto acid reacts with X has two O atoms. Suppose the product is an ester or a ketone. Wait, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid and X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates to form a salt, but that might not add O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid to a carboxylic acid. For example, oxidizing a secondary alcohol (like in a keto acid) to a ketone. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to think about the options again. The possible sums are 25,29,31,35. These could be sums of two elements. Let's see:

25: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25? No. Or 16 (O) +9 (F)=25? No. Wait, 12 (C) +13 (Al) is 25. But that would require X to have C and Al. Hmm, maybe X is something like aluminum carbonate? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: 25 could be 16 (O) +9 (F) =25. But fluorine is rarely in such compounds.

Alternatively, 25 could be 14 (N) +11 (Na) =25? No, 14+11=25. So elements would be N and Na. But that's not a common combination.

Wait, what if the elements are C and O. C is 12, O is16. Sum is 28, close to option C (31), but not exact. Hmm.

Another option: 25 could be 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) =25. So elements H and Mg. So X would have these elements. Maybe X is MgH2? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of X as NaOH. So, elements Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. But the option is 25. Close, but not exactly.

Alternatively, X could be something like Ca(OH)2. Elements Ca (40), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Ca (40). Sum 41, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the isotopes are considered. So, for example, if X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements, perhaps oxygen has a heavier isotope (like O-18). But how does that affect the sum?

Wait, the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. Oh, and if multiple instances, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe X is something like water with a heavier isotope, like D2O. So the elements are H and O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, which is not an option.

Another approach: Let's see the options again. 35,25,31,29. The sum is likely 25 or 29.

Wait, 25 is 12 (C) +13 (Al). Or 12 +13=25. So perhaps X is AlCO3? Not a common compound.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like KNO3. K is about 39, N is 14, O is 16. The lightest is N (14), heaviest K (39). Sum 53, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloride, like NaCl. Elements Na and Cl. Lightest Na (23), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum about 58.5, not an option.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Then elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13, not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of the initial reaction—X reacts with Y to produce CO2, a precipitate, and B. Then, G (precipitate) when heated gives B.

Wait, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the precipitate G could be a sulfide or another insoluble compound. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. Wait, no, the problem says X reacts with Y.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the products when X reacts with Y. W is CO2, G is a precipitate, and B is released. The precipitate G, when heated, gives B.

So, perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is CO2. No, because heating a
