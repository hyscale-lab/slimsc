Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots versus when it has spots.

Hmm. So first, I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2, but the problem states that this ratio decreases when there are spots. Wait, the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases. So when the ratio is lower, that would mean n1 is lower relative to n2 than before. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, meaning that activation is higher towards level 2. Which makes sense because lower temperature would cause less excitation, so lower populations in higher energy levels. Wait, but wait. Wait, actually, when the temperature is lower, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor would be more negative, meaning that the ratio (n2/n1) would decrease. Because exp(-delta E/(kT)) becomes smaller as T decreases. So if T goes down, n2/n1 goes down, which means n1/n2 goes up? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 decreases, then n1/n2 increases. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that would mean that when temperature is lower (with spots), n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, n2/n1 = ... proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), which is a smaller number. So n2/n1 becomes smaller, so n1/n2 becomes larger. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That implies that when T decreases, n1/n2 increases? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is about the ratio when the star has spots vs. when it doesn't. So the ratio is (n1/n2) when no spots, and when spots are present, it's (n1/n2)_spots. The question states that (n1/n2)_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 (which is level 1 to level 2) is lower. Wait, that's confusing because according to the Boltzmann equation, for lower T, n2 should be lower than n1, right? Because higher energy levels are less populated when T is lower. So n2 < n1, so n1/n2 > 1. But if T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would increase, because n1 is higher compared to n2. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is higher. But the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that would mean that (n1/n2)_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_no_spots. But according to the above reasoning, (n1/n2) should increase when T decreases. So this seems contradictory. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. 

Wait, the problem says, when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K. So in that case, the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. But the photosphere—wait, the spots are dark, so they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the overall effective temperature is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. But for the purpose of this problem, the question is about the stellar photosphere. Wait, but when the spots are present, the photosphere in those spots is cooler, but the rest is the same. Hmm. But the problem says, when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So maybe the average Teff is 5500 K, but the actual photosphere has some regions at 6000 K and others at a lower temperature.

Wait, but the question says, "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio..." So maybe the photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Or is it that the overall star's effective temperature is 5500 K, but the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. The problem states that when the surface is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's average T is 5500 K. But in reality, the star's surface is a mix of hotter (6000 K) and cooler (spots) regions. Wait, but the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light, and the effective temperature is a measure of the average. But when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere has a lower average temperature, but in areas without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps the entire photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present. Or is it that the spots are cooler regions within the same photosphere? I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it by treating the entire photosphere's temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. So the effective temperature is 5500 K in that case.

So then, when the star has no spots, the photospheric T is 6000 K, and when it has spots, it's 5500 K. So the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 depends on T. So the ratio when T is higher (6000) is different than when it's 5500.

The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio n1/n2 is smaller when T is 5500 compared to 6000. Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, as T decreases, the ratio (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if T decreases, exp becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) increases. But the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So that would imply that when T is lower (5500), the ratio is lower than when T was higher (6000). But according to the equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 should be higher. So how does this fit?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. The question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2). So let's say the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So when T is 5500, n1/n2 is lower than when T was 6000.

So that would imply that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 should increase because more atoms are in the lower energy level, right? Unless the energy difference is such that this effect is reversed, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the energy difference between the two levels is such that the ratio behaves differently. Let me think. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1 (which they are, since level 2 is higher energy), then when T increases, the exponential increases, so n2/n1 increases. So higher T leads to more excitation: more atoms in higher energy levels.

So when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher than when T is 5500 K. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases.

Thus, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Which is the inverse of n2/n1. So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, because T is in the denominator. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's compute it: (E2 - E1) is positive, so when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for higher T, the exponent is smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when T is higher (6000), n1/n2 is smaller. When T is lower (5500), n1/n2 is bigger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Wait, that's conflicting with the above. Because if T decreases, according to the equation, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when T is lower (with spots), the ratio decreases. So that can't be right unless I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I get the ratio backwards? The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2)", so let's say it's n1/n2.

When the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So n1/n2 is lower when T is 5500 than when T is 6000.

But according to the equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Which increases because (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger, making the exponential larger. So the ratio n1/n2 increases when T decreases.

But the problem says that the ratio DECREASES when the star has spots (lower T). So that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait a minute. Perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me recheck. The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2)". So if it's (n1)/(n2), and this ratio decreases when T is lower. Then, according to the equation, (n2/n1) would be higher when T is higher. So (n1/n2) would be lower when T is higher. So if the ratio decreases when T is lower, that would align. But according to the problem, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, which would be lower when T is lower.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Case 1: No spots. T = 6000 K. Ratio R = n1/n2.

Case 2: Spots. T = 5500 K. Ratio R' = n1/n2.

Problem states that R' < R. So when T decreases, R decreases. So n1/n2 decreases when T decreases.

But according to the equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. So why is R' < R?

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that the transition is in the rest frame of the star, but the star's overall temperature affects the excitation. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the two levels is negative? No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. The problem gives a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet. Let me think about what that implies.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So a shorter wavelength corresponds to higher energy. So the transition from level 1 to level 2 (or vice versa) is at 1448 Å. So E2 - E1 = hc/(λ), assuming it's a photon emitted when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1.

So E2 - E1 = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that.

Compute E: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

But to get this into electron volts (eV), since 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. That's a pretty big energy difference. So E2 is 8.56 eV higher than E1.

So E2 - E1 is a big number. So (E2 - E1)/(k T) is a big number, especially when T is around 5500 K or 6000 K.

Wait, let's compute (E2 - E1)/(k T) for both T cases. Let me get the Boltzmann constant, k: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So for T =6000 K:

(E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.56eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K)

Wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because E2 - E1 is 8.56 eV, which is 8.56 * 1.6e-19 J = 1.37e-18 J, as before.

So (E2 - E1)/(k T) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) )

Compute denominator: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20.

So 1.37e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ (1.37 / 8.28) * 1e2 ≈ (0.165) * 100 ≈ 16.5.

Similarly for T=5500 K:

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20.

1.37e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ (1.37 /7.59) * 1e2 ≈ (0.180) *100 ≈ 18.0.

So (E2-E1)/(k T) is about 16.5 at 6000 K and 18 at 5500 K.

That's a large number, so the exponential term exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is exp(-16.5) and exp(-18), which are very small numbers, approximately 1.4e-7 and 1.5e-8 respectively.

So the ratio (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -16.5 ) for T=6000, and exp(-18) for T=5500.

Assuming g2 and g1 are similar? Maybe they're the same, but the problem doesn't specify. If g2 = g1, then the ratio simplifies.

But wait, the ratio being considered is n1/n2. So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = 1/( (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) )

But wait, if the energy difference is positive, and the exponent is negative, then the exponential is a small number. So n2/n1 is a small number, so n1/n2 is a large number. So for T=6000 K, n1/n2 is 1/(g2/g1 * exp(-16.5)).

But for the sake of calculation, let's assume g2/g1 is 1 (same statistical weights). Then n1/n2 = 1 / exp( -16.5 ) = exp(16.5) ≈ 1.4e7.

Similarly, for T=5500 K, n1/n2 = exp(18) ≈ 1.5e8.

Wait, wait, but this seems extremely high. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is higher. So when the star has spots and T is 5500 K, the ratio is much higher than when T is 6000 K.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. But according to this, when T is lower, the ratio is higher, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given wavelength is the transition from level 2 to level 1, which would imply that E1 is higher than E2. That can't be right because higher energy levels have higher E. Wait, the transition from level 2 to 1 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, so E2 > E1. So the calculation is correct.

So according to the calculation, when T is 5500 K, n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the spots are present. That suggests that my assumption that the ratio is n1/n2 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let's re-examine. The problem says, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So n1/n2 is lower when T is lower.

But according to the equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher because the exponential term is larger. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1. Let's say the ratio is n2/n1. Then, when T is lower, this ratio decreases because the exponent is more negative, so the exponential is smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller. So (n2/n1)_spots < (n2/n1)_no_spots.

Which would mean that the ratio n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. So the ratio goes down when the star has spots.

But the problem says that the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Hmm. So perhaps the problem is referring to the inverse ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the excitation in the opposite way. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to the number in level 1. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. But according to the equation, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, because exp(-delta E/(k T)) becomes smaller. So this would make sense.

So, perhaps the problem is about n2/n1, but the question states it's n1/n2. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is n1/n2. And when the star has spots (lower T), this ratio is lower. So n1/n2 is smaller at 5500 K than at 6000 K.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy difference. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would require E2 > E1. So the energy is positive, but the exponent is negative.

Wait, the transition is when an electron moves from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So E2 is higher than E1 by hc/lambda.

So for the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference is E2 - E1. So the exponent is (- (E2 - E1))/(k T).

Wait, so the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Which, with E2-E1 positive, the exponent is negative, so the ratio n2/n1 is less than 1 if g2/g1 is 1.

Thus, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent becomes less negative. So exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So n2/n1 increases with higher T.

So when T is higher (6000 K), n2/n1 is higher. When T is lower (5500 K), n2/n1 is lower.

So for the ratio n2/n1, when T decreases, the ratio decreases.

But the problem says that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. But n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 decreases, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to make a table.

Case 1: No spots. T = 6000 K.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )

Case 2: Spots. T = 5500 K.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

Since (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger for lower T, the exponent is more negative, so exp is smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller in case 2. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases.

Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) increases when T decreases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the problem, n1/n2 is lower in case 2. But according to the calculation, it's higher.

So this suggests that the problem is either incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition corresponds to a lower energy level, meaning E1 > E2, which is impossible because higher levels have higher energy. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would require E2 > E1. So the calculation as before.

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem says that the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So perhaps the effective temperature is a combination of the hotter (6000 K) and cooler (spots) regions. But the photosphere's temperature is a mix. But the question is about the photosphere's ratio, so perhaps the effective Teff is what matters.

Alternatively, perhaps the photosphere's temperature is considered as 5500 K when spots are present, but they actually have regions at 6000 K and cooler. But the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.

But that's physically impossible because the spots are just areas with lower temperature, not the entire photosphere. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it.

In any case, perhaps the key is to compute the ratio of the ratios when the temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K.

The ratio is n1/n2. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which would be [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out.

So this becomes exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )) 

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] )

Compute that.

We have E2-E1 = 1.37e-18 J as before.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

T1 =6000 K, T2=5500 K.

Compute 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5/(330,000) ) = -1/(66,000) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (1.37e-18 J )/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) * [ (-1.515e-5 ) ]

Compute first part: 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx 1.37e5 = 137,000.

Multiply by (-1.515e-5): 137000 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -2.08.

So the exponent is approximately -2.08.

So exp(-2.08) is approximately 0.126.

So the factor is 0.126. But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. So 0.126. But that's less than one, which would mean the ratio is smaller when there are no spots.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, when T decreases, (n1/n2) increases. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is higher. So the ratio when no spots is lower than when spots are present.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

Which would mean that the factor (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.

But according to the calculation, it's 0.126, which is less than one. That can't be right.

Hmm. I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent.

E2-E1 = 1.37e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.37e-18)/(1.38e-23) ≈ 1.37 / 1.38 * 1e5 ≈ 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 9.93e4 = 99300.

Then [1/T1 - 1/T2] = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) = (-5/33000) = (-1)/(6600) ≈ -1.515e-4.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 6000*5500=33,000,000. Let me compute that again: 6000 * 5500 = 6000 * 5.5e3 = 33e6, which is 33,000,000. So yes.

So 1/6000 = 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818. So 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.0000151515 ≈ -1.515e-5.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in [1/T1 - 1/T2]. The correct value is approximately -1.515e-5, not -1.515e-4.

So let me recompute.

Exponent:

(E2-E1)/(k) * [1/T1 - 1/T2] = 99300 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 99300 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.506.

So exponent is about -1.506.

So exp(-1.506) ≈ approximately 0.221.

So the factor is 0.221. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but this is less than one, meaning that (n1/n2)_no_spots is smaller than (n1/n2)_spots. Which would imply that when the star has no spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Which aligns with the problem statement.

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So ratio_no / ratio_spots = 0.221. Which is a factor of ~0.22. But none of the options are near 0.22. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, but perhaps I should invert the ratio. Because the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots. So it's 0.221. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so ratio_no > ratio_spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.221. So that's a factor of about 0.22. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the exponent. Let me think again.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign here. Because the exponent in the ratio is (E2-E1)/(k T) for each case.

So the ratio is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

But wait, in the earlier calculation, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative, giving exp(negative) less than 1. So the factor is less than 1.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio_no is higher than ratio_spots.
