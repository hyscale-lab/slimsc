--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states after absorbing a photon. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of the photon. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. So, it's a diatomic like X-Y, with X having a mass of 20 amu and Y 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. They're asking what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. So, I guess this is about a transition between quantum states, probably involving both rotational and vibrational energy changes.

Wait, but wait. The question is a bit ambiguous. The 'next state with the lowest possible energy'—could that mean the next higher energy state, but the one closest in energy, which might involve either a vibrational or rotational transition? Or is it strictly the next higher state, which might involve a vibrational transition since rotational states are quantized and have smaller energy gaps.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0, but I'm not entirely sure if J starts at 0 or 1 for diatomics—Wait, I think for diatomic molecules, the rotational quantum number J starts at 0, but in reality, J=0 isn't allowed for certain molecules due to symmetry, but perhaps in this problem, J=0 is considered possible for simplicity).

So the molecule is in the ground state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next lowest state would be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational transition to v=1, or a rotational transition to J=1. But which requires less energy? Well, the vibrational energy gap is usually larger than the rotational gap. So maybe the next state is a rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The question says "next state with the lowest possible energy", implying the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon would cause the smallest possible jump to the next state, which would be a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

Alternatively, if the molecule is in the ground state, which includes both the vibrational and rotational ground states, then the next possible state could be either a vibrationally excited state (v=1) or a rotationally excited state (J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Let's calculate both and see.

Let me compute the energy differences for both types of transitions.

First, the vibrational energy levels. The energy for vibrational levels is given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The fundamental state is v=0, so the next vibrational state is v=1. The energy difference ΔE_vib would be E_v(1) - E_v(0) = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w. So ΔE_vib = h * w.

Then the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy is E_J = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so the next state is J=1. The energy difference would be ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0 = B[1*(1+1)] - B[0*(0+1)] = 2B - 0 = 2B. So the energy change for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

Now, I need to compare 2B and h w. If 2B is less than h w, then the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would cause a rotational transition. Otherwise, a vibrational transition.

So I need to calculate B, the rotational constant.

The rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia, and c is the speed of light? Wait, no—Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (h² / (8 π² I)) J (J + 1), so the constant B would be h²/(8 π² I). Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as B = ħ² / (2 I), but I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formula right.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The rotational constant B is h²/(8 π² I), so B = (h²) / (8 π² μ r²).

Wait, or perhaps B is sometimes written as ħ²/(2 I), because E_J = (ħ²/(2 I)) J(J+1). Oh, right, because ħ = h/(2 π). So E_J = ( (h/(2 π))² )/(2 I) ) J(J+1) = (h²)/(8 π² I) ) J(J+1). So B is h²/(8 π² I).

So, let's compute B.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ.

μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)

m_X is 20 amu, m_Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert amu into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.81818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ Let me compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 2.9998, so about 3.0e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

20 divided by 11 is approximately 1.81818.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let me compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 * 1.66 is:

1.8 *1.66 = 2.988, plus 0.01818*1.66≈0.0299, so total around 3.0179.

So μ ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg. Let's say approximately 3.02e-27 kg for calculation purposes.

Now, the bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.08e-47 kg m². Wait, wait, 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 is 12.08e-47? Wait, 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = (3.02 *4) e^(-27-20) )= 12.08e-47 kg m². Correct.

Now, B = h²/(8 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.957.

So denominator is 8 π² I = 78.957 * 12.08e-47 ≈ 78.957 * 1.208e-46 = Let's compute 78.957 * 1.208.

78 * 1.2 is about 93.6, 0.957 *1.208 ≈ 1.156. So total approximately 94.756. So 94.756e-46 ≈ 9.4756e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.4756e-45 ≈ approx 4.63e-23 J.

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if B is 4.63e-23 J, then 2B is 9.26e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change is h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So, 2B is 9.26e-23 J, which is about 1000 times smaller than h w (2.65e-19). So the rotational energy change is way smaller than vibrational.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate B.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate B step by step.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 43.9 *1e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Denominator 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46 ≈ 78.957 *1.208e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.957 * 1.208 = approx 78 *1.2=93.6, and 78 *0.008=0.624, and 0.957*1.208≈1.156. So total is about 93.6 + 0.624 +1.156≈ 95.38, so 95.38e-46 = 9.538e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.538e-45.

B = h²/(8 π² I) = 4.39e-67 / 9.538e-45 ≈ (4.39 /9.538 ) * 1e-67+45= 0.4598 * 1e-22 = 4.598e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is approximately 9.2e-23 J.

h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.65e-19 J.

So yes, 2B is much smaller than h w. So a rotational transition would require less energy than a vibrational one.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either J=1 (same v) or v=1 (same J). Which one has a smaller energy difference? Since 2B is smaller than h w, then the rotational transition would require less energy. So the photon would cause the molecule to transition from J=0 to J=1, keeping v=0.

So the energy of the photon should be 2B.

Wait, wait, but wait. No, because in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the total energy is the smallest possible increase. So the minimal possible energy jump would be the rotational transition, as 2B is much smaller than h w.

So the photon energy should be 2B.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is probably the next higher energy state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But which transition requires less energy? As we have, 2B is much less than h w. So the photon would need to supply 2B energy.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length can change, but in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed. Hmm, but the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. Wait, but does that affect the calculation of B? Because in a non-rigid rotor, the bond length isn't fixed, but in the calculation of I, we used a fixed bond length R. So perhaps the approach is similar to the rigid rotor model for the rotational part, and the vibrational part is treated separately.

So, in any case, for the rotational transition, the energy difference is 2B, which is much less than the vibrational transition's h w.

So the photon's energy should match the 2B rotational energy change.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is E = pc, since for photons, E = pc, where p is momentum, and c is speed of light.

So if the photon's energy is 2B, then p = E/c = (2B)/c.

So let's compute that.

We have B ≈4.6e-23 J.

2B = 9.2e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23)/(3e8) kg m/s.

Compute 9.2 /3 ≈ 3.07, and exponents: e-23 / e8 = e-31.

So p ≈ 3.07e-31 * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, no: 9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 = 3.066...e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are near 3e-31. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I miscalculated B. Let me go back.

Wait, wait, perhaps the confusion is between rotational and vibrational contributions. Alternatively, maybe the photon needs to supply the vibrational energy, which is larger, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy"—so the smallest possible energy increase. So the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, but let me recalculate B more accurately.

Let me compute I again.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ ?

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute 1.81818 *1.6605.

1.81818 *1.6605: 1.8 *1.66 is approx 2.988, 0.01818*1.6605≈0.02997. So total ≈3.01797e-27 kg.

So μ ≈3.01797e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.01797e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01797e-27 *4e-20 = 12.0719e-47 kg m².

Wait, 3.01797e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.07188e-47 kg m².

So I =1.207188e-46 kg m².

Then B = h²/(8 π² I).

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s.

h squared: (6.62607e-34)^2 = let's compute 6.62607^2 = approximately 43.904. So 43.904e-68 = 4.3904e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 π² I =8 * (π^2) * I.

π^2 ≈9.8696.

8 * 9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.207188e-46 kg m².

Compute 78.9568 *1.207188 ≈ let's see:

78 *1.2 =93.6,

78 *0.007188≈0.561,

0.9568 *1.2 ≈1.148,

0.9568 *0.007188≈0.00688.

Adding them up: 93.6 +0.561=94.161; 1.148 +0.00688≈1.15488. Total ≈95.31588.

So denominator is 95.31588e-46 =9.531588e-45.

B= (4.3904e-67) / (9.531588e-45) ) = (4.3904 /9.531588 ) * 1e-67+45.

4.3904 /9.531588 ≈0.4603.

So B ≈0.4603e-22 J.

Wait, because 4.3904e-67 /9.531588e-45 = (4.3904/9.531588 ) *1e-67+45 = (0.4603) *1e-22.

So B ≈4.603e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.206e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B =9.206e-23 J.

But the photon's energy is E = pc, so p = E / c.

c=3e8 m/s.

p=9.206e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.0687e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 1e-27 to 1e-28, which are much larger than 1e-31. So I'm way off. Hmm, that can't be right. Where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check the formula for B.

Wait, another version of the formula I've seen is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c²) * c^2? No, wait, perhaps B is expressed in terms of the rotational constant in cm^-1, but maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. But that would be in terms of wavenumbers. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy.

Wait, alternatively, the rotational energy is E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1), so B in the formula E_J = B J (J+1) is h²/(8 π² I), which is what I used.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, let me recalculate I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22≈1.81818 amu.

Convert 1.81818 amu to kg:

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.81818 *1.66054.

1.81818 *1.66054 = let's compute step by step.

1.8 *1.66054 = 2.9890 (approx), and 0.01818 *1.66054 ≈ 0.029999.

So total ≈ 2.989 +0.0300 =3.019 kg. Wait, no, in e-27 kg.

So μ = 3.019e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

r squared =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =12.076e-47 kg m² =1.2076e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Wait, then B is h²/(8 π² I).

h=6.626e-34.

h²=4.39e-67.

8 π² I=8*(9.8696)*1.2076e-46.

8*9.8696≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2076e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.9568 *1.2076.

78 *1.2076 = approx:

70 *1.2076 = 84.532,

8 *1.2076=9.6608 → total 94.1928.

Wait, precise calculation:

78.9568 *1.2076 = let me compute 78.9568 *1.2 =94.74816,

78.9568 *0.0076 ≈ 0.598.

So total≈94.74816 +0.598≈95.346.

So denominator 95.346e-46 =9.5346e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.5346e-45 = approx 4.39 /9.5346 ≈0.4603 → 0.4603e-22 →4.603e-23 J.

So B is correct.

So, E_photon = 2B=9.206e-23 J.

But this gives p= E_photon/c =9.206e-23 /3e8 =3.068e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, but the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy needed is the vibrational energy, and not the rotational. Let me check.

If the photon's energy is h w, which is 6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Then p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28, option C is 1.1e-27.

Wait, 8.8e-28 isn't among the options. Closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28).

Hmm, but earlier analysis said that the rotational transition requires much less energy, so why is this discrepancy? Did I get the model wrong?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the next state is the (v=1, J=0) state, which is higher than (v=0, J=1). Or perhaps the energy levels are such that (v=1, J=0) is lower than (v=0, J=1). I need to think about that.

Wait, the total energy is E_total = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

E_vibrational for v=1 is (1 + 1/2) h w = 3/2 h w.

E_rotational for J=1 is (2) B.

So the energy for (v=1, J=0) is (3/2 h w) + 0 = 1.5 h w.

The energy for (v=0, J=1) is 0 + 2 B.

Which is lower? If 2 B < 1.5 h w, then (v=0, J=1) is lower than (v=1, J=0).

So let's compute 2B and 1.5 h w.

We have B =4.6e-23 J → 2B=9.2e-23 J.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

1.5 h w= 3.975e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is way less than 3.975e-19 J. So the (v=0, J=1) state has lower energy than (v=1, J=0).

So the first excited state after the fundamental (v=0, J=0) would be (v=0, J=1), requiring energy 2B.

Thus, the photon's energy should be 2B=9.2e-23 J.

But that gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I did something wrong, or perhaps the question is considering a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous excitation of both rotational and vibrational modes. But that would require more energy, not less, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps B is h²/(8 π² I c²) * c^2 ?

Wait, no. The formula for rotational energy is E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Did I forget to account for the reduced mass in the rotational constant? No, because I used the reduced mass μ in calculating I.

Wait, maybe the bond length is given in angstroms, but I forgot to convert it to meters correctly. No, I used r =2e-10 m.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule goes to the lowest possible energy state higher than the ground state, regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational. But that would still require the photon's energy to be 2B or h w, depending on which transition is lower.

Wait, but in any case, the energy required for the rotational transition is much lower. So the photon's momentum would be 3e-31 N s, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the rotational ground state but the vibrational first excited state, but that's not the case. The question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, which includes both v=0 and J=0.

Wait, another possibility: What if the rotational state is J=1, but transition requires energy from rotational and vibrational? No, because the question says the next state has the lowest possible energy, so it's the minimal energy jump.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the energy in terms of the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Because when you have a diatomic molecule, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0, and the first transition is to v=1, which requires h w.

But in that case, the photon's energy is h w, which gives p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8= 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N s. Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Hmm, none match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed, because the molecule is vibrationally in the ground state. But that's for selection rules, but the question doesn't mention selection rules, so perhaps it's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when it causes a transition to the next possible state, whether that's rotational or vibrational. But that would require taking the smaller of the two. So, because 2B is smaller, the photon's momentum is based on 2B.

But again, the calculation gives p=3e-31 N s, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the question is considering the energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. But no, because the next state would be the one with the smallest possible increase.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition that includes both a vibrational and a rotational change. For example, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). But that would require more energy than either transition alone.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon excites both a vibration and rotation, but that's unlikely as it would require the photon to have enough energy for both, which is not the minimal case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the minimal energy transition but the first possible transition. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

I= μ r² = (20*2/(22)) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion. Let me recompute I.

μ in kg: (20*2/(22)) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

20*2=40, 40/22≈1.81818.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2068e-46 kg m².

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² I=8*(pi^2)*I =8*(9.8696)*1.2068e-46.

8*9.8696≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2068e-46 ≈95.3e-46 =9.53e-45 kg m².

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 =4.6e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum as the rotational energy divided by c. Wait, but E_photon = pc → p= E_photon /c.

So if E_photon is 2B=9.2e-23 J, then p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question intended for a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

If the photon's energy is h w=2.65e-19 J, then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. Closest is option A, but 8.8e-28 is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So photon's momentum is 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference when both vibrational and rotational transitions occur, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but in the lowest rotational state, which for diatomic molecules could be J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule's symmetry. But I think for simplicity, in this problem, J=0 is allowed.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the energy difference between the (v=1, J=0) state and the (v=0, J=0) state. That's the energy required for a vibrational transition without any rotational change.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that 2B is much smaller than h w, so the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon will make the transition to the (v=0, J=1) state, requiring 2B energy. So why isn't this matching the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, which treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid rotor model allows for bond length changes. But the calculation of B is based on a fixed bond length.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reduced mass in a different way.

Wait, no, the reduced mass is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the moment of inertia as I = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y) * r^2, but that's what I did with μ r².

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). Let me check that.

E_J = ħ² J (J+1)/(2 I).

So B would be ħ²/(2 I).

Let me compute B again using this formula.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(2 I) = 1.112e-68 / (2 *1.207e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / (2.414e-46) )= approx (1.112 /2.414) * 1e-22 → about 0.460 *1e-22 =4.60e-23 J.

Same result as before. So B is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's energy to cause the molecule to go to the next vibrational state (v=1) regardless of rotational state. That would require energy h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.8e-28 kg m/s, but this isn't an option.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me compute h*w/c again.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon=h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p= E_photon /c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.8347e-28 N s.

So that's 8.83e-28 N s. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is considering the transition to the next state of the rotational level, which requires 2B, but uses the vibrational energy as the photon's energy. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between the models.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the question states the non-rigid model, which includes vibrational changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the photon's energy required to transition the molecule from the ground state to the next possible state in either vibration or rotation. So the minimal energy is 2B, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the energy of the photon. Let me compute 2B in terms of momentum again.

E_photon =2B =9.2e-23 J.

p= E_photon/c= 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.067e-31 N s.

But this is way below the options given. So perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational energy, but I'm miscalculating something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum as per the momentum of light, which is E/c. So if the photon's energy is 2.65e-19 J, p=8.8e-28 N s.

But again, this is not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo and the options are off by a factor of 1000. Let me see: 3.06e-31 is 3e-31, which is 3e-31.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of rotational and vibrational energies, but that would be higher, leading to even larger p, which isn't matching.

Another thought: perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer isn't among the options, but I have to choose the closest. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute I and B.

I=μr².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11= approx 1.81818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg= approx 3.019e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, B= h²/(8 π² I).

h=6.626e-34.

h²=4.39e-67.

Denominator:8 π² I=8*(9.8696)*1.2076e-46= 78.9568*1.2076e-46= approx 95.3e-46=9.53e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45=4.6e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 N s.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy, but I'm miscalculating. Let me see.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N s.

Again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the wavenumber for the vibrational energy, but that's usually in cm^-1. Let me see:

wavenumber ν̃ = w/(c), where c is speed of light in cm/s.

c=3e8 m/s=3e10 cm/s.

ν̃ =4e14 rad/s / (3e10 cm/s) * (1/(2π)) )= (4e14)/(3e10 *2π) ) cm^-1.

Wait, but this isn't necessary because the energy is h w.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the formula for the rotational energy as E_J = J (J+1) B, where B is in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of cm^-1.

The rotational energy can also be written in terms of the rotational constant B (in cm^-1), where E_J = J (J+1) B, and B is h/(8 π² c I) (in cm^-1).

Wait, because B (cm^-1) = h/(8 π² I c), where I is in kg m².

So let's compute B (cm^-1).

I=1.2076e-46 kg m².

B (cm^-1) = h/(8 π² I c).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

B=6.626e-34/(8 * π^2 *1.2076e-46 *3e8) )

Let me compute denominator:

8 * π^2 ≈78.9568.

1.2076e-46 *3e8 =3.6228e-38.

So denominator=78.9568 *3.6228e-38 =78.9568 *3.6228≈286.22 → 286.22e-38=2.8622e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.8622e-36 ≈ (6.626 /2.8622 ) *1e2 → approximately 2.314 *1e2=231.4 cm^-1.

So B=231.4 cm^-1.

Wait, but how does this help? The rotational energy is E_J = J (J+1) B, but B is in cm^-1. So the energy in J is E_J = J (J+1) * B (cm^-1) * h c / c, since 1 cm^-1 corresponds to hc/(cm) energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think differently.

The rotational energy for J=0→J=1 transition is 2B, which in terms of wavenumbers is 2 *231.4=462.8 cm^-1.

The energy difference is Delta E = 462.8 cm^-1 * h c * (1/cm).

Wait, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to h c / cm, where cm is 0.01 m.

So Delta E =462.8 * h c / (0.01 m).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

Delta E =462.8 *6.626e-34 *3e8 /0.01.

Compute 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Divide by 0.01 (which is 1e-2) → 1.9878e-25 *1e2=1.9878e-23.

Multiply by462.8 → 462.8 *1.9878e-23 ≈921e-23=9.21e-21 J.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation using B in J gave 2B=9.2e-23 J. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1 cm^-1 in joules.

1 cm^-1 = h c / (1 cm) =6.626e-34 *3e8 / (0.01) =6.626e-34 *3e10 =1.9878e-23 J.

So, B (cm^-1) =231.4 cm^-1 → energy per cm^-1 is 1.9878e-23 J.

So Delta E = 2 *231.4 *1.9878e-23 J = 462.8 *1.9878e-23 ≈921e-23=9.21e-21 J.

Wait, that's way higher than earlier calculation. So this suggests that the rotational transition requires 9.2e-21 J, which would give photon momentum p=9.2e-21 /3e8=3.07e-29 kg m/s=3.07e-29 N s.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is considering a different model or perhaps the answer is option C) 1.1e-27.

Wait, 1.1e-27 is about 1.1e-27 kg m/s. Let me compute what energy that corresponds to.

E = p c =1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which is about 3.3e-19 J.

If E= h w → w=E/h=3.3e-19 /6.626e-34=4.97e14 rad/s.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So 4.97e14 is close but not the same.

Alternatively, if E=2B, then 2B=3.3e-19 → B=1.65e-19 J.

But earlier calculation said B=4.6e-23 J. So this isn't matching.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, regardless of rotational state. That would require energy h w, leading to p=8.8e-28 N s. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would require more energy, not less.

Wait, another possibility: the problem refers to the molecule being in the 'fundamental state' as the state with J=0 and v=0, and the next state could be J=1 and v=0. So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, giving p=3.07e-31 N s. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model where the energy levels are treated differently. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the rotational energy is considered as a part of the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of reduced mass.

Wait, I'll recheck that:

μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

Yes.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition with the reduced mass involved. But that doesn't seem relevant.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the state (v=1, J=0), which would require energy h w. So p= h w/c= (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8=8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I have to choose the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake in the options, but this is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N s.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is between options A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28), but closer to option A.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the reduced mass is wrong. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic mass, but that's unlikely to affect the result significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit. Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational contributions. But that would require more energy, not less.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer based on the rotational transition, but I'm getting p=3e-31, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but that's way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the formula for the rotational constant.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is B= (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is in kg m². Yes.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28 N s, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem intended for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies, but that's not minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me see: 3.07e-31 is 3.07e-31 = 3.07e-31 / 1e-27 = 3.07e-4 times 1e-27. So that's 0.000307 times 1e-27. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me check another source.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2h²/(8 π² I) )= h²/(4 π² I).

So ΔE= h²/(4 π² I).

But I = μ r².

So,

ΔE = h²/(4 π² μ r²).

Which can be written as ΔE = (h²)/(4 π² μ r²).

So let me compute this.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

μ=3.019e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * π² *3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2=4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * π² *3.019e-27 *4e-20.

Denominator=4 *9.8696 *3.019e-27 *4e-20.

4 *9.8696≈39.478.

39.478 *3.019e-27≈119.12e-27=1.1912e-25.

1.1912e-25 *4e-20=4.7648e-45.

So,

ΔE=4.39e-67 /4.7648e-45= (4.39/4.7648) *1e-22= approx 0.921 *1e-22=9.21e-23 J.

Which matches the earlier calculation of 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So again, p=9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition in terms of the photon's wavelength, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using different constants, like c=3e8 m/s or 3e10 cm/s. But that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to compute the photon's momentum for the (v=0, J=1) transition using B in terms of wavenumbers, but that leads to a higher energy.

Another thought: perhaps the problem considers the rotational energy change as 2B, where B is in terms of the wavenumber multiplied by h c.

Wait, B=231.4 cm^-1.

So E= B * h c / cm.

Wait, cm is 0.01 m. So E=231.4 * (6.626e-34 *3e8) /0.01.

E=231.4 * (1.9878e-25) /0.01.

1.9878e-25 /0.01=1.9878e-23.

231.4 *1.9878e-23 ≈4.607e-21 J.

So 2B=9.214e-21 J.

p=9.214e-21 /3e8=3.07e-29 kg m/s=3.07e-29 N s.

Still, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options are wrong. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer based on the vibrational transition, but I'm missing a factor. Let me check.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E=h w=2.65e-19 J.

p=E/c=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Planck's constant, like h=4.1357e-15 eV s. But that's for converting to eV, which isn't relevant here.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find a matching option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the photon's momentum is not E/c, but something else. No, for photons, E = pc is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum in the molecule's rest frame, but that doesn't change anything.

I'm stuck. Based on all calculations, the correct momentum is 3.07e-31 N s for the rotational transition and 8.8e-28 N s for the vibrational transition. Since neither matches the options, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy plus the rotational energy. That would be h w +2B=2.65e-19 +9.2e-23≈2.65e-19 J. So p≈8.8e-28 N s, same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Perhaps the closest option is option D)1.4e-28 N s, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 N s, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon when considering the vibrational transition. Let me recompute:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E=h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s=8.8347e-28 N s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A)1.9e-28 and option D)1.4e-28. But 8.8e-28 is between them. Perhaps the problem expects to consider only the vibrational transition, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to give a different value for the bond length or angular frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me recheck:

μ= (20 *2) / (20+2) =40/22=20/11=1.81818 amu.

Yes.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the intended answer is probably based on the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28 N s, but since this isn't an option, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)1.9e-28 N s, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me compute 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s.

2.65e-19 /3e8 = (2.65/3) *1e-27 → approx 0.8833e-27=8.833e-28 kg m/s.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, and the intended answer is 8.8e-28, but it's not present. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy transitions based on the given parameters:

### Key Parameters:
- **Masses**:  
  \( m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{m_X \cdot m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
  \]  
  Convert to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}. \)

- **Angular frequency of vibration**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}. \)

### Rotational Energy Constant:
The rotational energy constant \( B \) is given by:  
\[
B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}, \quad \text{where } I = \mu R^2.
\]  
First, calculate \( I \):  
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
\]  
Now, calculate \( B \):  
\[
B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}}.
\]  
\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2.
\]  
\[
8 \pi^2 I = 8 \cdot (9.8696) \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \approx 95.3 \times 10^{-46} = 9.53 \times 10^{-45}.
\]  
\[
B = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.53 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Vibrational Energy Transition:
The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Rotational Energy Transition:
The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.60 \times 10^{-23} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Comparison of Transitions:
The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)) than the rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the **rotational transition**.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.20 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
\]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the momentum would be:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
\]  
This value is also not listed among the options. Given the provided options, the closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), though it is not exact.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, even though the calculated value does not perfectly align with the options. The closest match is:

**Answer: A**
