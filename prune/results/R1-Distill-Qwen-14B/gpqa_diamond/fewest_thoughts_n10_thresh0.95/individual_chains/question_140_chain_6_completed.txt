--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think it through step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. 

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, X and its analogs are common reagents.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are.

Starting with gas W: the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That probably means it's a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, or maybe the molecule as a whole. Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think, possible gases like H2, O2, F2, Cl2... Wait, but the problem says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons.

Wait, the molecule as a whole. So for each molecule, the sum of protons in each atom equals the sum of neutrons in each atom. Let's think of possible gases that fit this.

Hydrogen gas (H2): each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So molecule has 2 Hs. So protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. So no.

Oxygen (O2): each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (since O-16 is common). So each O has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 has 16 p and 16 n. So yes, that fits. So W is O2.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe CO2? No, that's a gas too, but each CO2 molecule has C (6 p, 6 n usually) and O (8 p, 8 n). But for the molecule, the sum of protons is 6 + 16 = 22, sum of neutrons is 6 + 16 = 22. So that would also fit. But CO2 is a gas, yes.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and Y. Let me think about what reactions produce CO2 or O2. If Y is water, perhaps? Or maybe acid reacting with something.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What compounds have a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe something that decomposes upon heating, like a carbonate?

Wait, B's melting point is near 277 K, so about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, that's higher. Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is something like ice, but that can't be. Or perhaps something like sodium nitrate, which has a higher melting point. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that's about 800°C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is something that is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. Wait, maybe it's a hydrate? Or perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reaction. If X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G, and perhaps other products. If W is O2, then maybe the reaction is a decomposition of some compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas, but our earlier consideration of W being O2 complicates that.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate. If Y is an acid, then X could be a carbonate reacting to produce CO2 gas. But then W would be CO2, whose molecule has 12 (6 from C, 6 from each O) protons and 12 (6 from C, 8 from each O) neutrons. Wait, that's 12 protons and 12*2=24 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, each CO2 molecule has 1 C and 2 O. So protons: 6 (C) + 16 (2 O *8 each) = 6 +16=22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*(8) (O)=6+16=22. So CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that would satisfy the condition. So W could be CO2.

If so, then the reaction would be between a carbonate (X) and an acid (Y) producing CO2, water, and a precipitate (G). But then, when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate salt, which upon heating decomposes.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial reaction. If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would be: X (carbonate) + Y (acid) → CO2 + H2O + G (precipitate, which is a salt of the acid and the base from X). But if G is a carbonate, it wouldn't make sense because the acid would have reacted with the carbonate to produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfite or something else. Let me think about B. If B's melting point is around 277 K (4°C), what's that? Maybe it's a hydrate? Or perhaps B is sodium carbonate decahydrate, but that doesn't have a melting point that low. Alternatively, maybe B is something like ammonium chloride, but I don't think that's it.

Wait, another angle: the product of a certain keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product would be the result of, say, adding X to a keto acid. If X is a reagent, perhaps it's something like a strong base or a reducing agent.

Wait, in organic chemistry, common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, maybe something else. But X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a metal with a common isotope, like chlorine having a heavier isotope (e.g., Cl-35 vs Cl-37). Wait, but the reaction details are needed.

Alternatively, X could be something like sodium or potassium, which when reacting with an acid (like Y) would produce H2 gas. But earlier I thought W could be O2 or CO2. Let's reevaluate.

If W is H2 gas, then the molecule has 2 H atoms, so 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That doesn't satisfy the same number of protons and neutrons. So that's out.

Wait, another possibility: gas W is H2O. Wait, no, because W is a gas released. H2O can be a gas (like steam), but for a molecule, H2O has 2 H (1 proton each, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, that's a gas but it's a molecule with 14 protons (N=7, H=1 each) and 10 neutrons (N has 7 neutrons, H has 0). 14 vs 10: not equal.

Hmm. Let's think of other possibilities. What about O2? O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits.

So W is O2. Then, in the reaction between X and Y, O2 is released. So what reactions produce O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction, or a reaction involving a peroxide.

Wait, another angle: when a carbonate is heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the corresponding metal oxide. But if X is a carbonate, and upon reaction with Y (maybe acid) produces CO2, but that's another scenario. Alternatively, if X is a chlorate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and a metal salt. But then if the precipitate G is the metal salt, which upon heating releases B, perhaps when heated, the metal salt decomposes further.

Wait, but then if the precipitate G is a metal hydroxide, which when heated might decompose into a metal oxide and water. But how does that tie into gas W being O2?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). Reacting with an acid (like H2O, but that's a liquid) would produce O2 gas.

Wait, let's think: sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce NaOH and O2 gas. So the reaction would be:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

In this case, W is O2. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH? But NaOH is a liquid, not a precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different liquid, like an acid. Then, if X is Na2O2, reacting with an acid might produce O2, but I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is KMnO4. But when KMnO4 reacts with an acid like H2SO4, it can produce MnSO4, water, and O2 gas. But KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent.

But wait, in that scenario, the precipitate G would be MnSO4, which is a solid. When heated, perhaps it decomposes, but I'm not sure what product would have a melting point of ~277 K.

Another possibility: think about the production of O2 from hydrogen peroxide. 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. So if Y is H2O2, and X is a catalyst like MnO2. But in that case, X (MnO2) wouldn't be incorporating a heavier isotope necessarily.

Wait, but the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is something like Cl2, where Cl has a heavier isotope, Cl-37.

Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic gas, so when it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps something else is involved.

Alternatively, maybe X is a heavier isotope of sodium, say Na-23 (but that's the lightest). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think again about the product of a keto acid with X. The product has 2 atoms of oxygen. So if X is a reagent that adds oxygen, perhaps it's something like KMnO4, which can oxidize compounds. Or maybe it's a base that deprotonates the keto acid.

Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. If X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would deprotonate the keto acid, forming its conjugate base. But the product would have the same number of oxygens as the keto acid, unless X adds or removes oxygens.

Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think: the keto acid might have more oxygens, but after reaction with X, it loses some. Alternatively, perhaps X adds an oxygen, but the product has only 2.

Wait, another angle. The product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two oxygen atoms. But how would that happen? If X is a reagent that when reacts with the keto acid, produces CO2. But that might not make sense unless X is a strong oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid with two oxygen atoms. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something like decarboxylation, where a keto acid loses CO2. For example, when a keto acid is heated with a base, it can lose CO2. So if X is a base, like NaOH, then the reaction would be:

CH3COCH2COOH (a keto acid) + NaOH → CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ → upon heating, loses CO2.

But wait, the product would be CH3COCH3 (acetone) and NaCl, but that doesn't fit with the condition of having two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is esterification. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone with two oxygen atoms. For example, formaldehyde (HCHO) has one O, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) has two O's. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a dihydroxy compound. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to approach this from the perspective of X's possible identity.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Common reagents that use isotopes might include things like D2O (deuterated water), but that's more about hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like Cl2, where Cl-35 and Cl-37 are common.

Wait, if X is Cl2, then when it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps something like water, but that reaction produces HCl and O2? Wait, no. Cl2 + water → HCl and HOCl, but that's not O2.

Alternatively, maybe X is NaOH. When NaOH reacts with a carbonate (like CaCO3), it produces CO2 gas. So, in that case, Y would be a carbonate, but that's getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let me re-examine the reaction:

X (substance) reacts with liquid Y → gas W (same neutrons and protons in molecule), precipitate G. When G is heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

If W is O2, then X could be a peroxide, but peroxides react with acids to produce O2. For example, H2O2 reacts with H2SO4 to produce O2. But then X would be H2O2, which is a liquid, not a solid. So maybe X isn't the peroxide.

Alternatively, X could be a metal peroxide, like Na2O2. Reacting with an acid (liquid Y) would produce O2. But earlier thought about that didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is H2O2, but it's a liquid. Then, when it reacts with another liquid Y, maybe a catalyst or something else, produces O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Reacting with an acid Y (like HCl), produces CO2 gas, NaCl, water. Then precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is a solid. When heated, NaCl doesn't decompose (it melts at 801°C). So that doesn't fit with B's melting point of 277 K.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think about B again. If B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So B is a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above 0°C. What's a common compound that behaves like that?

Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C, which is way higher. Hmm. Maybe something like sodium nitrate? No, higher. How about something like iodine? No, that's around 113°C. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is a hydrate. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate melts at around 25°C, but that's not 4°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like a sodium bicarbonate, but that's not, as it decomposes upon heating.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think, when the precipitate G is heated, it produces B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. But earlier analysis didn't fit with the product's melting point.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid, then G is the corresponding salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me consider the information about the product of X and a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the reaction adds an oxygen or removes some.

Wait, if X is a strong base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), then the reaction would deprotonate it, but the product would have the same number of oxygens. So unless X adds an oxygen.

Wait, maybe X is a halogen, like Cl2. If the keto acid is something like malonic acid, and X is Cl2, then perhaps a substitution reaction happens, adding Cl. But that wouldn't necessarily add oxygen.

Alternatively, if X is a reagent that oxidizes the keto acid, perhaps converting a -CH2- group into a -COOH group. But then the product would have more oxygen.

Wait, another approach: the product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe it's CO2, but that's a gas, not a product of a reaction with a keto acid and X.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with two oxygen atoms. For example, acetone has three carbons with two oxygen atoms (O). So, if X is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone, perhaps. But then the product would have two oxygen atoms.

Wait, in that case, if the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (OOCCOOH), reacting with X might produce something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base, and the reaction with the keto acid forms its conjugate base. For example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH, reacting with X (like NaOH) would produce the sodium salt, CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. But that doesn't change the number of oxygen atoms; it just deprotonates.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO2, leaving a ketone. So if the product is a ketone with two oxygen atoms, like acetone (which has two oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups?), wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has one oxygen. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diethyl ether or something similar, but that's not a direct product from a keto acid and a base.

I might be going in circles here. Let's try to think of the elements in X. X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, the elements in X must have at least two isotopes, one lighter and one heavier.

Common elements with significant isotopes include Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is Cl2, it's a possibility. Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and when it reacts with a liquid, perhaps something like water. But Cl2 doesn't react with water to produce O2.

Wait, but Cl2 and water react to form HCl and HOCl, but that doesn't produce O2. So that's out.

Another element with heavy isotopes: S. S has isotopes, but perhaps not as relevant. Another is O, but O-18 is heavier.

Wait, maybe X is a compound containing a heavy isotope. For example, something like D2O (deuterated water), but that would be for hydrogen isotopes.

Wait, let's think about the initial reaction again. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce O2, a precipitate G. When G is heated, it gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So perhaps G is a metal oxide, and when heated, it decomposes into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaNO3. Reacting with something could produce O2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for example, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. The lightest is Na (atomic mass ~23), the heaviest is Cl (~35.5). But the question says to sum the masses of all the lighter and heavier isotopes.

Wait, but the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Oh, that's a bit confusing. So, for each element in X, we have to consider all their isotopes and sum their atomic masses. Wait, no, perhaps for each element, sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes present.

Wait, perhaps for each element in X, take the lightest isotope's mass and the heaviest isotope's mass, add them together, and then sum that for all elements in X.

Wait, for example, if X is Cl2, Cl has isotopes with masses ~35 and ~37. So for Cl, the lightest is 35, the heaviest is 37. So sum is 35 +37 =72. But wait, the options have much lower numbers. So perhaps the sum is per element, and if X has two elements, sum their lightest and heaviest.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element in X, and then sum all those together.

Wait, the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". Wait, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses. So if X has two elements, say, A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, then sum their atomic masses.

For example, if X is NaOH, elements are Na, O, H. Lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16) or Na (23). So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But 24 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, the options are 35,25,31,29. So perhaps the sum is 25.

Wait, if X is HCl, elements are H (1) and Cl (35.5). So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, but that's close to option A (35) but not exact.

Alternatively, if X is NaCl, elements are Na (~23) and Cl (~35). Sum of lightest (Na is 23) and heaviest (Cl is 35) is 58, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic element, like O2 or Cl2. For O2, the elements are O. The lightest isotope is O-16 (16), heaviest is O-18 (18). Sum is 34. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, X is something else. Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X having two O atoms. If X is a base, perhaps the reaction deprotonates the keto acid. But how would that lead to a product with two O's?

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, the keto acid loses a COOH group, but that would produce a CO2 and a ketone. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), reacting with a base could lead to decarboxylation, producing acetone (CH3COCH3) and CO2. So, the product would be acetone, which has two O atoms (one in each carbonyl group). So that fits the condition.

In this case, X would be a base used for decarboxylation. Common bases for decarboxylation include NaOH or KOH. So X could be NaOH.

Wait, but NaOH is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Now, considering that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Na has isotopes, but the common ones are Na-23. Wait, are there heavier isotopes? Well, Na has Na-24 (unstable) and Na-25, but those are rare. So perhaps the heavier isotope is not significant. But Cl has more stable heavy isotopes.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. So lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But 24 isn't an option. So maybe X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. But NH3 is a base and a reagent, but I'm not sure about the heavier isotope part.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), where the heavy isotope is deuterium (D). So for D2O, the elements are H (light isotope, 1) and D (heavier, 2). So sum is 1+2=3. But that's way too low, and the options are higher.

Hmm. Let me think about the initial reaction again. If the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B with a melting point near 277 K. What if B is a hydrate? For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? Wait, checking: Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K. Oh! That's exactly the temperature given.

So B is Na2CO3·10H2O. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which is the decahydrate. Wait, no, because heating would typically remove water, not add it. Wait, perhaps when G is heated, it loses water, forming an anhydrous compound. But the melting point of B is 277 K, which is when it's a hydrate.

Wait, perhaps when G is heated, it loses water, and the anhydrous form has a higher melting point. But the problem states that B's melting point is near 277 K, which is when it's a hydrate.

So, B is sodium carbonate decahydrate. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. That implies that when G is heated, it gains water? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps when G is heated, it decomposes into B and something else. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps when G is heated, it loses CO2, leaving a residue. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), CO2, and H2O. So if B is Na2CO3, and its melting point is around 277 K. Wait, but sodium carbonate's melting point is about 823°C, which is much higher than 277 K (4°C). So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps B is some other carbonate. Let me think, magnesium carbonate has a melting point around 1100°C, way higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride. Its melting point is 334 K (about 61°C). Close but not 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different salt. Wait, another thought: sodium nitrate's melting point is 327°C, which is 600 K, so no.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate of some sort. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 277 K (4°C). Wait, I think that's correct. So if B is sodium acetate trihydrate, then when G is heated, it releases B.

But I'm not sure about the exact melting points, but let's proceed.

So, if B is sodium acetate trihydrate, then when G is heated, it produces sodium acetate trihydrate. Hmm.

Wait, let me tie this all together. If X is a base like NaOH, which is used in organic reactions, and when it reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate), produces CO2 gas, which fits W's condition. Then, the precipitate G would be NaCO3 or something else.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's consider the initial reaction again:

X (Substance) + Y (liquid) → W (gas, same neutrons and protons in molecule) + G (precipitate).

If W is O2, then the reaction is probably a decomposition of a peroxide. So if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is water (liquid). The reaction would be:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

In this case, W is O2. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is a liquid, not a precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. For example, if X is Na2O2 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction could produce O2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X having two O's. If X is a base like NaOH, the product would be the conjugate base of the keto acid, which doesn't change the O count. So perhaps X isn't a base.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4. When KMnO4 reacts with a keto acid, it might oxidize it, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2. If the keto acid is something like propiolic acid, Cl2 could add across the triple bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: if X is a diatomic molecule with a heavier isotope, like Cl2. Cl has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So X would be a mixture of both. But when X reacts with Y, perhaps Y is a hydrocarbon or something else.

Wait, but the reaction produces O2 gas. So perhaps X is a catalyst in the decomposition of H2O2, which is Y. So X is MnO2, and Y is H2O2. The reaction would be:

2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑, with MnO2 as a catalyst.

In this case, X is MnO2. But the question states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. Mn has several isotopes, including Mn-55 (most common), Mn-54, Mn-56, etc. So, X is MnO2, which contains Mn-55, which is the lightest? Or perhaps a heavier isotope exists.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't MnO2 but another compound. Hmm.

If X is MnO2, then the elements present are Mn and O. The lightest element is O (16), the heaviest is Mn (55). So sum is 16 +55=71. That's not an option.

Wait, but the options are much lower, so perhaps X has only one element. For example, if X is O2, but that's just O. So lightest and heaviest isotopes of O. O-16 is 16, O-18 is 18. Sum is 34. But the options don't have 34.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X is Cl2, which has Cl isotopes. Lightest is Cl-35 (35), heaviest is Cl-37 (37). Sum is 72. Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with more than one element, but the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is the answer. For example, if X is HCl, elements H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule with the same element, like O2 or Cl2. So for X being O2, the elements are O. The lightest isotope is O-16 (16), heaviest is O-18 (18). Sum is 34. Not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes within each element present in X. For example, if X has two elements, for each element sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes, and then add those sums together.

For example, if X is NaOH: elements Na, O, H.

Na: lightest is Na-23 (23), heaviest maybe Na-25 (25). Sum: 48.

O: lightest O-16 (16), heaviest O-18 (18). Sum:34.

H: lightest H-1 (1), heaviest H-2 (2). Sum:3.

Total sum: 48 +34 +3=85. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something with only two elements. Let's say X is NaCl.

Na: 23 (lightest), maybe Na-24 or 25 as heavier. Let's say 23 +25=48.

Cl: 35 +37=72.

Total sum:48+72=120. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with a single element, and the sum is the lightest and heaviest isotopes for that element.

But the options are all around 25-35. Let's think, another element with isotopes that sum to around that.

Wait, Carbon (C) has isotopes. C-12 (12) and C-14 (14). Sum is 26, which is option B.

But would X be a carbon-containing compound?

Wait, if X is CO2, but that's a gas, and the question says X is a substance used as a reagent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with C and another element. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So if X is a halogen, like Cl2, and the reaction is an addition to the keto acid, forming a dihalide. For example, if the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH, adding Cl2 might lead to substitution, but I'm not sure how that would give a product with two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like Mg. Mg reacts with an acid (Y) to produce H2 gas, but earlier analysis showed that H2 doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that when reacted with Y (water) produces O2.

Wait, magnesium doesn't react with water to produce O2. But sodium peroxide does, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, potassium reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but again, that doesn't fit with W being O2.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but I think the key is to figure out what X is. Let's try to think about the possible answers.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Earlier, I thought about carbon's isotopes. C-12 and C-14 sum to 26, which is close to option B (25). But perhaps the question is considering natural abundance and using C-12 and C-13. C-12 is 12, C-13 is 13. Sum is 25, which matches option B.

So if X contains carbon, and the other element is something with a light isotope, perhaps.

Wait, if X is CO2, but earlier thoughts didn't fit. Alternatively, X could be something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with only carbon and another element, and the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes is 25.

Suppose X is CO2: then, C's lightest is 12, heaviest is 14. O's lightest is 16, heaviest is 18. So for each element, sum their lightest and heaviest. C:12+14=26. O:16+18=34. Total sum:26+34=60. Not an option.

Wait, but the question says to sum the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So perhaps for each element in X, find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum them, and then add those sums together for all elements in X.

So for X as CCl4: C has 12 and 14, sum 26. Cl has 35 and 37, sum 72. Total 98. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is CH4. For C:12+14=26. H:1+2=3. Total 29. Option D is 29.

So if X is CH4, which is methane. But CH4 is a gas, and the question says X is a substance, possibly a reagent. I'm not sure, but perhaps.

But then, what would be the reaction? CH4 doesn't react with liquid Y to produce O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CO (carbon monoxide). Then, C:12+14=26. O:16+18=34. Sum 60. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is Na2CO3. Na:23 +25=48. C:12+14=26. O:16+18=34. Sum:48+26+34=108. No.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the information given again. The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a base, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, the keto acid loses a COOH group, becoming a ketone with two O atoms.

Wait, for example, if the reaction is the decarboxylation of a keto acid with X (like NaOH) to form a ketone. So the product is a ketone, which has two O atoms (like acetone).

In that case, X is NaOH. So elements in X are Na, O, H.

Na: lightest isotope is Na-23 (23), heaviest is Na-25 (25). Their sum is 48.

O: lightest O-16 (16), heaviest O-18 (18). Sum 34.

H: H-1 (1), H-2 (2). Sum 3.

Total sum is 48 +34 +3=85, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the elements present in X, not their isotopes. So for each element, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum them, and add all together.

But then, for X as NaOH, the sum would be (23+25) + (16+18) + (1+2) = 48 +34 +3=85.

Not matching options.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the only elements present in X are C and O, and the sum is 12 (lightest C) + 16 (lightest O) + 14 (heaviest C) + 18 (heaviest O) = 12+16+14+18=60. No, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic element with two isotopes. For example, X is O2. So the elements are O. Lightest isotope O-16 (16), heaviest O-18 (18). Sum is 34. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". Wait, the 'heaviest' and 'lightest' elements, not isotopes. So for example, in X, identify the lightest element (by atomic number) and the heaviest element, then sum their atomic masses.

For example, in X=NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

In X=KNO3, elements are K (39), N (14), O (16). Lightest is N (14), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 53. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is Cl2. Elements are Cl (35.5). Lightest and heaviest are the same element, so sum is 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CO. Elements C (12) and O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: in X, the lightest element is H and the heaviest is Cl. So sum is 1 (H) +35 (Cl) =36. Not an option.

Wait, the options are 25, 29, 31,35.

Wait, 25 is option B. How could I get 25?

Another possibility: X is a molecule with two elements, the lightest being H (1) and the heaviest being S (32.07). Sum is 33.07, which is close to 33, but not an option.

Alternatively, X is HCl. H (1), Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something with elements C and H. For example, C2H5OH (ethanol). Elements C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with the same element, and the sum is the lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a molecule with two different elements, and the lightest and heaviest elements are O and Cl. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 25, option B. How?

If X is a compound where the lightest element has an atomic mass of 12 (C) and the heaviest 13 (another isotope of C). Then 12 +13=25. But that would require X to be a carbon compound with only C as an element, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with only C and another element whose lightest and heaviest sum to 25. Let me think, 12 (C) +13 (another element) =25. So the other element would have an atomic mass of 13, which is Al (27) but that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the other element is N (14). 12 (C) +14 (N) =26. Close to option B (25), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps it's considering the sum of the lightest and heaviest element isotopes in X as a single element. For example, if X is oxygen, sum O-16 and O-18: 16+18=34. Not an option.

Another approach: perhaps the sum is the atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of the same element. For example, for Cl, 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the two most abundant isotopes. For Cl, 35 and 37 are the main ones, sum 72. For O, 16 and 18, sum 34.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule composed of two elements, each contributing one isotope. For example, X is NaCl. Na-23 and Cl-35. Sum 58. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the problem again.

Substance X reacts with Y (liquid) → gas W (same number of protons and neutrons in molecule), precipitate G. G when heated → B with melting point ~277 K.

Earlier I thought W is O2. So, what if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. Then, W is CO2, which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, as each CO2 molecule has 22 each.

So, CO2 has 12 (C) +16*2 (O) =44 g/mol. Protons:6 +16=22. Neutrons:6 +16=22. So W is CO2.

So, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid.

Reaction: X (metal carbonate) + Y (acid) → CO2 gas, water, and precipitate G (salt of the acid and metal).

Then, when G is heated, it releases B. Which has a melting point near 277 K. So B could be sodium carbonate decahydrate, which has a melting point around 277 K.

So, when G (the salt, maybe NaCl) is heated, it releases B (Na2CO3·10H2O). But wait, that doesn't make sense because heating NaCl would not produce Na2CO3·10H2O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when G is heated, it loses water, forming a more stable compound. Wait, but B's melting point is 277 K, which is when it's a hydrate.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate that upon heating releases CO2, leaving a residue. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes into carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be the carbonate, but that's higher melting.

Hmm. Let me think about the elements in X. X is a carbonate, so it contains CO3^2- and a metal ion, say Na+.

So X is Na2CO3. The elements are Na and C and O. 

Now, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X.

Lightest element: C (12) or O (16)? No, wait, the lightest element is the one with the lowest atomic number. In X, elements are Na (11), C (6), O (8). The lightest element is C (6), the heaviest is Na (11).

So, the lightest element is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 12 +23=35. Which is option A.

Wait, that's possible. So the answer would be 35, option A.

But wait, let me double-check. X is Na2CO3. Elements are Na, C, O.

Lightest element by atomic number is C (6), heaviest is Na (11). Their atomic masses are 12 and 23, sum 35. So option A is 35.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to release gas W (with the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule), forms a precipitate G, and when G is heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This points to CO₂, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons (6 from carbon and 16 from each oxygen atom). CO₂ is a plausible gas released in the reaction.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O) has a melting point close to 277 K, suggesting B is Na₂CO₃·10H₂O. This implies G is likely a carbonate salt.

3. **Reaction of X with Y**: X reacts with Y (likely an acid) to produce CO₂ gas, water, and a precipitate G (a carbonate salt). This suggests X is a carbonate, such as Na₂CO₃.

4. **Product with a Keto Acid**: The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This aligns with decarboxylation reactions, where a keto acid loses CO₂, forming a ketone with 2 oxygen atoms.

5. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium (Na) has isotopes, including Na-23 (lighter) and Na-25 (heavier). Carbon (C) has isotopes, such as C-12 (lighter) and C-14 (heavier).

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The problem requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For Na₂CO₃:
   - The lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ≈ 12).
   - The heaviest element is sodium (Na, atomic mass ≈ 23).
   - The sum is \( 12 + 23 = 35 \).

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (Na₂CO₃) sum to 35. This matches option **A**.

**Answer: A**
