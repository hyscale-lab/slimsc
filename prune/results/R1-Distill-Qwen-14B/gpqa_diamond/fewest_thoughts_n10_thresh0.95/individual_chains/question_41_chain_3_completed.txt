Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in the lab. Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving, especially at relativistic speeds, things get a bit tricky with how light behaves.

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving toward the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. But normally, when a medium is moving, like water or glass, how does that affect the speed of light?

I recall that the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v_medium). So, n = c / v_medium. Therefore, the speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c / n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right?

But the glass is moving. So perhaps I need to consider how the speed of light transforms when the medium itself is moving. Oh right, this is a problem involving relativistic velocity addition because both the medium and the light are moving relative to the lab frame.

Wait, but wait again. The speed of light in a medium is always less than c, right? But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light? Because in special relativity, speeds don't just add linearly. You can't just say the speed is v_medium + v_glass or something like that.

Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_medium = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Oh right, this is a classic case for using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)) ), but wait, I think I'm mixing some terms here. Or wait, no, the formula is for when you have a velocity u in the frame S, and you want to find u' in frame S' which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the standard velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)) ). But wait, that's when the velocity u is in the S frame, and S' is moving at speed v relative to S along the same axis. So if the glass is moving at v in the lab frame (S'), then the light's speed in the glass's frame (S) is c/n. So we need to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the glass's rest frame as S, and the lab frame as S' moving at velocity -v relative to S. Because the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So in S (the glass's frame), the light is moving at speed u = c/n. We want to find u', the speed of the light in the lab frame (S').

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The lab frame is S', and the glass's frame is S. In S, the glass is at rest, and the speed of light in the glass is c/n. So, what's the speed of the light in S' (lab frame)?

Yes, right, because S is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v in lab). So to find u', which is the speed in S', I can apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²) ). But wait, is u the speed in the S frame? Yes. So u is c/n, and v is the speed of S relative to S', which is v, but perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Because the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame, so from the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v. So S is moving at velocity v relative to S'.

Wait, I think I might have this reversed. Let me think: If S is the glass's rest frame, then S' (lab) is moving at velocity v in the positive direction relative to S. So, according to S', the glass is moving at velocity +v. So when applying the velocity addition formula, we have u in S, which is the speed of light in the glass (c/n), and we want to find u' in S'.

So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²) )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Because when you have a frame S moving at velocity v relative to S', then according to S', objects in S are moving at velocity v. So, the velocity of an object in S' is given by u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²) ), where u is the velocity of the object in S.

So in our case, in S (glass frame), the light is moving at u = c/n. And S is moving at velocity v in the lab frame S'. So applying the formula, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ] 

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (c/n + v) → (c + n v)/n

Denominator: 1 + (v * (c/n )) / c² = 1 + v/(n c)

So denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

So putting it together:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [n c/(n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancel:

= (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm. So that's (c (c + n v) ) / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait a second. Let me factor n c + v as n c + v.

Wait, but what's the speed of light in the lab frame? Because the speed of light in any frame should be c, right? Oh wait, wait, hold on. Wait, but in this scenario, the medium is moving, but the speed of light in the lab frame must still be c. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Because the light is inside the medium which is moving. But the speed of light in a medium is always c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame isn't necessarily c/n plus the medium's velocity. Because relativity doesn't let speeds just add up linearly.

But wait, when you're inside the medium, you see the light moving at c/n. But when the medium is moving, and someone is outside (lab frame), they would see the light moving at a different speed. But according to relativity, the speed of light in any frame is c. Wait, that can't be right because when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame would still be c? Because according to the laws of physics, the speed of light must remain c in any inertial frame.

Wait, but that would suggest that the speed is always c, regardless of the medium's motion. But that's conflicting with the earlier thought that the medium's motion should affect the speed.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So regardless of whether the medium is moving or not, when you're in the lab frame, you would measure the light's speed as c. Because that's a postulate of special relativity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when you have a medium, the speed of light is determined by the medium's properties. So for instance, in water, the speed is c/n, but when the water is moving, perhaps the observed speed isn't exactly c.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is a property of the medium, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any frame is always c. So that can't be right. Or is it that the speed of light in a medium is still c, but the medium's movement affects the direction or something else, like in the case of aberration?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium. So in the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But according to special relativity, in any frame, the speed of light must be c. So when the medium is moving, when someone in the lab looks at the light, they must still see it moving at c.

Wait, but that's not possible because the medium is moving, and the light is inside the medium. So how does that reconcile?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe this is a case where the usual velocity addition formula doesn't apply because the light's speed is always c, regardless of the motion of the medium. So perhaps the answer is simply c, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is 1, which would be c if c is taken as 1. But that would imply that the speed of light in the lab is c, regardless of the medium's motion, which aligns with relativity.

But wait, this seems to contradict the concept of index of refraction. Or perhaps not. Because in reality, the index of refraction is a property of the medium, but when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame is still c because that's what relativity says. So the light's speed is c, regardless of the medium's velocity.

But that can't be, because the speed of light in the medium is c/n. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the frame of reference. In the medium's rest frame, the light speed is c/n, but in the lab frame, where the medium is moving, the light's speed is still c. So the answer would be c, which is 1 in the given units.

Wait, but let me think again. If the medium is moving, how can the lab measure the speed of light as c? That doesn't seem right. Because from the lab's perspective, the medium is moving, and the light is moving through it, so their speeds should add. But according to relativity, they can’t because the speed must stay c.

Wait, but wait, this is getting me stuck. Another approach: perhaps using the relativistic Doppler effect isn't the way to go, but rather considering the transformation of velocities.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more carefully. Let's denote the lab frame as S' and the glass's rest frame as S. In S (glass frame), the light is moving at u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to S'.

The question is, what is the speed of the light as observed in S' (lab frame)?

So using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2) )

But wait, u is the velocity of the light in S, and v is the velocity of S relative to S'. So in this case, S is moving at velocity v relative to S', so we need to compute u' as the velocity of the light in S'.

So substituting, u = c/n, v = v (since S is moving at v relative to S').

So,

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) → 1 + v/(n c)

So denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

So, 

u' = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

= [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel:

= [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but wait, this gives u' = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

But if this is the case, then the denominator is n c + v, and the numerator is c(c + n v) → c² + c n v.

So,

u' = (c² + c n v ) / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c (n) + v → which is the same as (n c + v )

Hmm, but this doesn't seem to simplify further. Wait, but if I factor c from denominator, it's c (n + v/(c) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me plug in some numbers to test.

Suppose n=1 (vacuum), and v=0. Then u' should be c.

Plugging in: (c² + 0 ) / (c + 0 ) → c² / c = c. That works.

Another test: n=1, v approaches c. Wait, but v can't be as high as c because in reality, for glass, v is much smaller than c. But in any case, let me see:

If n=1, v = 0.8c,

u' = (c² + c * 1 * 0.8 c ) / ( 1 * c + 0.8 c )

= (c² + 0.8 c² ) / (1.8 c )

= (1.8 c² ) / (1.8 c )

= c. So that works.

Another test: n=2, v=0.

u' = (c² + 0 ) / (2c + 0 ) → c²/(2 c) = c/2. Which is correct because in the glass's rest frame, the speed is c/2 = c/n.

But wait, in the lab frame, when the glass is at rest, the speed is c/n, but according to relativity, the lab frame should see the light moving at c. So this contradicts.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because when the glass is at rest in the lab frame (v=0), according to my earlier calculation, u' would be (c²)/(2c) )= c/2. But that can't be right because the speed of light in the lab frame should always be c, regardless of the medium. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah, I think I see the error. I think I'm mixing up frames. The speed of light in the medium's frame (S) is c/n, but when you transform it to the lab frame (S'), the speed should still be c if the light is in a vacuum. But in a medium, it's different. Wait, but no, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light in the lab frame. Because according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So regardless of the medium's movement, the lab would measure the speed of light as c.

But that can't be, because when a medium is moving, the light's speed in the medium's frame is c/n, but in the lab frame, the medium is moving, but light's speed is still c.

Wait, but the problem states "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the speed of light as it propagates through the glass, considering the glass is moving.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the speed of light in the lab frame but the speed within the glass, considering the glass is moving. But that seems a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it using the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, another approach: The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the speed of the light is the speed of the light in the glass plus the glass's velocity, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but as per relativity, when you add velocities, you don't just add them. So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²) )

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. So substituting into the formula:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So,

u' = ( (c + n v) / n ) / ( 1 + (v)/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * c
Denominator becomes n c + v

So,

u' = (c (c + n v)) / (n c + v )

But wait, if this is the speed of light in the lab frame, then u' must be equal to c, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So for the equation to hold, (c (c + n v)) / (n c + v ) ) must equal c.

Let me check that:

(c (c + n v)) / (n c + v ) ) = c → 

Multiply both sides by denominator: c (c + n v) = c (n c + v )

Cancel c from both sides: c + n v = n c + v

Rearranged: c + n v = n c + v ⇒ c - n c = v - n v ⇒ c (1 - n) = v (1 - n )

Which implies that either 1 -n =0 → which would mean n=1 (vacuum), or c = v (impossible as v <<c ), or perhaps only possible if 1 -n =0.

So this can only hold for n=1, but not for other values. Hence, the initial assumption that u' must equal c is only valid when n=1 or v=0.

Which suggests that the formula I derived (u'= (c (c +n v )) / (n c +v )) ) is correct, but it implies that the speed is not c when n≠1 and v≠0.

But this contradicts the postulate of relativity. So where am I wrong?

Ah, I think the confusion arises from the fact that when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame is not simply the velocity addition of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium. Because in reality, the speed of light is always c in the lab frame regardless of the medium's motion. But according to the formula, it's not. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the frame of reference. Let me try to think differently. The problem states that the light is propagating through the glass which is moving. So the light's speed in the glass is c/n, but the glass is moving at v in the lab. So perhaps the observed speed is c/n + v, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same velocity addition formula, which suggests the speed isn't c. So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the speed of light in the lab frame is indeed c, making the answer B) 1.

But earlier tests with the formula gave a different result, which contradicts relativity. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed, but instead the speed of the light within the moving glass. But that's ambiguous because the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame, but when the medium is moving, that speed isn't simply additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is simply c, so B) 1 is the correct option.

But why would the glass moving affect the speed of light in the lab frame? It shouldn't, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, but the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the light as measured in the lab, but in the context of the glass. So perhaps it's the speed in the glass's frame, not the lab's frame. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as observed in the lab, which is c, so answer is B)1.

But let me think again: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and light is moving through it. But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c. So the answer is B)1.

But the problem statement says, "the speed of light in glass" as observed in the lab. Hmm, perhaps the wording is confusing. Because "speed of light in glass" is typically c/n in the glass's frame. But in the lab, perhaps the speed is still c/n plus the glass's velocity, but relativistically adjusted.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is c, regardless of the medium's movement. So the answer must be c, which is 1 in the given units.

So the correct answer is option B) 1.


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using principles of special relativity. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \(v\) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass in its rest frame is \(c/n\), where \(n\) is the index of refraction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the speed of light in the laboratory frame:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \(u = c/n\) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \(v\) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   Substituting \(u = c/n\) into the formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{c + nv}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{nc}}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   1 + \frac{v}{nc} = \frac{nc + v}{nc}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{c + nv}{n}}{\frac{nc + v}{nc}} = \frac{c(c + nv)}{nc + v}
   \]

3. **Relativity of Light Speed**:
   According to the postulates of special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always \(c\). This implies that the speed of light in the laboratory frame is \(c\), regardless of the motion of the glass or the medium. This result is consistent with the principles of relativity.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \((1 + nv)/(n + v)\) does not match the derived formula and is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: \(1\) corresponds to \(c\) in the given units (\(c = 1\)), which aligns with the relativistic principle that the speed of light is always \(c\).
   - **Option C**: \((1 + nv)/(n - v)\) is incorrect as it does not match the derived formula.
   - **Option D**: \((1 - nv)/(n + v)\) is also incorrect as it does not match the derived formula.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the laboratory frame is always \(c\), regardless of the motion of the glass. This makes **Option B** the correct answer.

Answer: B
