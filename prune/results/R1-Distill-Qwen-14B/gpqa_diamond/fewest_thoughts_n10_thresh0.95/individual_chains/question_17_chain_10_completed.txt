Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K tells us about the stability of that complex. K is a big number, so the complex is quite stable.

Wait, the complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution.

I think the formation constant K is given by the equation K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but wait, if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because each Ca²+ binds one EDTA molecule.

But wait, when the complex is formed, the solution is in equilibrium. So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, since each Ca-EDTA complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, assuming they dissociate completely? Wait, no, because K is a large number, so the dissociation is minimal. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So, the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. But under ideal conditions (pH is ideal), we can consider that the EDTA is in its deprotonated form, so it's mostly Y^4-.

So, the formation constant equation is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-])

Let me think. Since the solution is 0.02 M in CaY²-, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal because K is very large. So, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free Y^4- would be very low.

But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the total concentration is the sum of the complex and any dissociated forms. But if the complex is very stable, the dissociation is negligible, so [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M.

But wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one of Y^4-. So, if [Ca²+] = x, then [Y^4-] would also be x, assuming that all the free EDTA is in Y^4- form (which is the case under ideal pH and conditions).

So, substituting into the K equation: K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) => K = 0.02 / x².

Wait, but wait. I think I might have that backwards. Because [CaY²-] is the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. So, [CaY²-] = 0.02. The K is given by K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

So, K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → approximately 4.47e-7.

Wait, wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are A)2e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1e-2.

Wait, the value I got is around 4.47e-7, which is close to 6.3e-7. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-do the math. K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2). So, x² = 0.02 / 5e10. Let me compute 0.02 divided by 5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So, approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.

Wait, but wait. Am I considering the stoichiometry correctly? The problem states that it's a stoichiometric solution, so perhaps the solution contains only Ca-EDTA complex and nothing else. So, the total concentration of Ca²+ would be the same as the concentration of the complex times the fraction that dissociates, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that [Ca²+] is equal to the concentration of the complex multiplied by (1/K)^(1/2), but I think I've done that correctly.

Wait, another approach: The formation constant K is given, so K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

The total concentration of Y is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = [Y_total], but under ideal conditions and since K is large, [CaY²-] is much larger than [Y^4-], so [Y^4-] is approximately equal to ( [CaY²-] ) * ( [Ca²+] ) / K ).

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the dissociation equilibrium.

Let me consider that the complex is in equilibrium with Ca²+ and EDTA. So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

So, K = 5e10 = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But the total EDTA (Y_total) is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = [Y^4-] + 0.02.

But wait, if we're assuming that the solution is in stoichiometric conditions, perhaps the concentration of EDTA added is just equal to the concentration of calcium added. So, when they form the complex, the initial concentrations are such that [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are x each, and [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. Wait, no, because the initial concentrations would be from the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. Let [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

So, K = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x^2 = 4e-13 → x = 2e-6.5 → approximately 6.32e-7 M. So, the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Assuming the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), the concentrations of free \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{Y}^{4-}]\) are equal, denoted as \( x \).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
