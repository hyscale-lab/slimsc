Alright, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry means there's a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a mirror that's perpendicular to the main axis.

Looking at the options: 

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, I think triisopropyl borate is like (i-Pr)3B(O) something. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, like a bridge structure. The other two options seem to be more complex with multiple rings.

Starting with option C, triisopropyl borate. So, the structure has three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl groups are like (CH(CH3)2) groups. B has three identical substituents, so maybe there's some symmetry. But wait, boron is trigonal planar, so the groups are arranged in a trigonal planar manner. Since all three isopropyl groups are the same, maybe the molecule has a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, like all substituents are in the same plane, then maybe there's a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is higher, but I'm not sure. I think triisopropyl borate has a C3v symmetry or maybe C3h? Because C3h would require the presence of a horizontal mirror. But I'm not certain.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bridge with two rings. I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. The molecule is symmetric with three identical bridgehead positions. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Does it also have a mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry because it has three equivalent positions, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Wait, maybe it has a horizontal mirror plane. So, if it has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry. Or maybe it's just C3.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. That sounds like a benzene ring connected to a trifuran system. Trifuran has three oxygen atoms connected in a ring. The numbering suggests substituents in specific positions. If there are three substituents symmetrically placed, maybe it has a C3 axis. But I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a horizontal mirror, then perhaps C3h symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. That's a more complex structure, with three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran ring. So, three phenyl groups are substituents on the trifuran. If all three phenyl groups are in equivalent positions, then the molecule would have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane as well? If the structure is such that each phenyl is placed symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal arrangement, then it could have C3h. Alternatively, maybe not, depending on how exactly the substituents are placed.

So, thinking again: C3h symmetry has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Let's evaluate each option.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. All three substituents are the same, so a C3 axis exists. Is there a mirror plane? If the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement, perhaps there's a plane perpendicular to the axis. So, yes, perhaps C3h. But I'm not entirely certain about the presence of the mirror plane.

Option D: quinuclidine. Norbornane has a three-membered bridge, so when you have three identical substituents (like in quinuclidine), that suggests a C3 axis. Quinuclidine's structure is such that each bridge is equivalent. I think the molecule has a three-fold axis and might also have a mirror plane. Wait, quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize: imagine a plane cutting through the center of the bridge. If each side mirrors the other, that would be a mirror plane. So, if it has both a C3 axis and a mirror plane, then it would have C3h. Hmm, but I'm not sure if quinuclidine's mirror plane is horizontal. Wait, the mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, if the molecule's C3 axis is vertical and there's a horizontal mirror plane, then yes, C3h. Alternatively, maybe the mirror is vertical.

Wait, maybe I should think about each molecule's structure.

Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, it has a bridge that connects two carbons, each bridge being two carbons. The molecule has three bridges. Each of the three bridgeheads is equivalent. So, when you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Yes, a plane that passes through the bridge and one of the bridgeheads. But wait, if the mirror plane is vertical, it might pass through one bridge and the opposite side. Hmm, but I'm not sure if it's a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple planes, but I think the main symmetry is C3.

Wait, maybe I should look for C3v or C3h. C3h has a horizontal mirror, while C3v has a vertical mirror. So, if quinuclidine has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h. Alternatively, if the mirror is vertical, it would be C3v.

Alternatively, I might be confusing C3h with another point group. Maybe I should think about the actual symmetry elements present.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (Option A) has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. If the positions are 1,3,5 or similar, the molecule would have a three-fold axis and perhaps a mirror plane.

Wait, when substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion, that suggests C3 symmetry. If the molecule also has a mirror plane, perhaps that's C3h.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. So, trigonal planar around B. The molecule is symmetric with the three substituents. So, it has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If the molecule is non-planar, perhaps not. Wait, the isopropyl groups themselves are in a plane. So maybe the entire molecule is planar. If so, then a horizontal mirror plane could exist. Wait, perhaps the mirror plane is in the plane of the molecule. But for C3h, the mirror plane should be perpendicular to the C3 axis. If the C3 axis is perpendicular (like vertical), then the mirror plane would be horizontal. So, if the molecule has a vertical C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then yes, C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is vertical, which would make it C3v symmetry, not C3h. Hmm.

But triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, so all three substituents are in the same plane. So, perhaps the mirror plane is in that same plane. Wait, but that would be a sigma (σ) plane, but not a horizontal one. Wait, a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the main axis (C3). If the C3 axis is vertical, then the horizontal mirror would be something like slicing the molecule from top to bottom. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the axes.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a C3v symmetry because the mirror planes are vertical.

Wait, maybe I should think about benzene. Benzene has D6h symmetry. But in this case, it's a much smaller molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a different symmetry. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge. Its symmetry is more likely to be C3 because of the three bridges. If it has a three-fold axis and a plane of symmetry, but whether it's a horizontal plane or not.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual symmetry elements each molecule has.

C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has:

- A three-fold rotation axis (C3)
- A horizontal mirror plane (σh)

So, for a molecule to have C3h, it should have both these elements.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the substituents are arranged around a central point in a trigonal fashion, so a C3 axis. Also, if the molecule is planar, there might be a horizontal mirror plane. So, C3h.

Similarly, if the molecule is symmetric with three substituents arranged in a trigonal way and is planar, then yes.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a mirror plane. Let's think of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. It has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h symmetry.

Wait, but 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is C3h. So, maybe similar reasoning applies.

So, in this molecule, if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal symmetric fashion and the molecule is planar, then C3h.

Looking back at the options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
It's a trifuran with three phenyl groups attached. The substitution pattern would determine the symmetry. If the phenyl groups are at positions that are 120 degrees apart, then the molecule could have a C3 axis. Also, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror would exist. So, C3h.

Option B: benzo[...], which has a similar structure but perhaps with a different substitution pattern. Maybe the substituents aren't symmetric enough.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, maybe C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a mirror plane. If the mirror plane is horizontal, then C3h. Otherwise, if it's vertical, perhaps C3v.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The molecule has a bridge with three equivalent bridgeheads. So, a three-fold axis is present. Now, the symmetry planes: a plane that bisects the molecule through the bridge might be a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror. Perhaps it's not. So, maybe quinuclidine has C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is horizontal. Let me visualize it: imagine looking down the C3 axis. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's horizontal (like slicing through the middle), then it would have a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not sure. Another approach: what's the point group of quinuclidine? I think it's C3h, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I might have mixed up. I remember that some bicyclic compounds have higher symmetry. Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and also a plane of symmetry. Wait, but it's more about whether the mirror plane is horizontal. Quinuclidine's structure is such that if you look along the C3 axis (say, vertically), the molecule appears symmetric across a horizontal plane?

Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is vertical. So, perhaps the symmetry is C3v, not C3h.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the actual examples.

Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option A) has three phenyl groups attached to a central trifuran ring. The substituents are in positions that are symmetrically equivalent, so a C3 axis exists. If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane exists, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, triphenyleno might have substituents in such a way that the molecule is non-planar, but that's less likely. I think the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically, leading to a planar structure with a C3h symmetry.

Looking at the options, the question is which one has C3h symmetry. So, between options A, C, and D perhaps.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: the structure is B with three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, so all three substituents are in the same plane. Therefore, a C3 axis. But would a horizontal mirror plane exist?

If the C3 axis is vertical, then a horizontal mirror would be in the plane of the molecule. So, if the molecule is planar, then the mirror plane is indeed in that plane, which would be a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, if the C3 axis is vertical, the mirror plane would be horizontal, cutting through the plane of the substituents. So, yes, that would give C3h symmetry.

So, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3h symmetry because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But wait, what about the other options? Let me think again.

Option D: quinuclidine. If it has a C3 axis and a vertical mirror plane, then it would be C3v, not C3h. So, it wouldn't match.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. If it's a benzo ring connected to a trifuran, perhaps the substitution pattern isn't symmetric enough for C3h.

So, the conclusion is that triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake with quinuclidine.

Wait, another point: when the mirror plane is in the same plane as the substituents, it's a horizontal mirror. So, for triisopropyl borate, which is planar, the mirror would be in the same plane as the substituents, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, yes, C3h.

Wait, but the three isopropyl groups are around B, in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, the molecule is planar, and a horizontal mirror would lie in that plane. So yes, the symmetry is C3h.

So, looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, which should have C3h symmetry. But wait, the options list:

Options are A, B, C, D.

The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry.

So, the correct answer would be C, which is option C.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, if my analysis is correct, option C is the correct answer.

But I'm not 100% sure because I'm a bit confused about quinuclidine's symmetry. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Wait, I think quinuclidine is a tricyclic molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps it has C3h symmetry as well.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of another way. Let's consider the number of symmetry elements.

C3h has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, do any of these molecules have that?

Triisopropyl borate: yes, because it's planar, with three identical substituents, so C3 and a horizontal mirror plane (same as the plane of the molecule).

Quinuclidine: perhaps it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, again, C3h.

But how to differentiate between these?

Wait, maybe the presence of a horizontal mirror plane in quinuclidine. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's horizontal, then yes. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. It's a bridged bicyclic structure with three bridges. It's a fairly symmetric structure. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis that goes through the three bridgeheads. Wait, no, the three bridgeheads are in a trigonal arrangement, so a three-fold axis would pass through the center of the molecule, rotating the bridges into each other. So, C3 is present.

Now, what about mirror planes? If I imagine a plane cutting through the middle of the molecule, perhaps along the longest axis, would that be a mirror plane? Alternatively, a plane cutting along the three bridges. But I'm not sure if that's a horizontal plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that's vertical, not horizontal. So, the mirror plane would be vertical, making the point group C3v, not C3h.

So, if quinuclidine has a vertical mirror plane, it's C3v. So, it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, which is required for C3h.

Therefore, the correct answer would be triisopropyl borate (option C), which has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

Wait, but wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane is the same as the plane in which the substituents lie, which would make it a horizontal plane if the C3 axis is vertical. So yes, that would satisfy C3h.

So, the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the options based on the defining characteristics of **C₃h** symmetry: the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**). Here's the evaluation of each option:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran ring with three phenyl groups attached. The phenyl groups are positioned symmetrically, suggesting a **C₃** axis. Additionally, if the molecule is planar, a horizontal mirror plane could exist. This arrangement aligns with **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. While the structure may have some symmetry, the substitution pattern does not appear to be symmetric enough to support **C₃h** symmetry. The phenyl groups are not arranged in a trigonal fashion, and no clear horizontal mirror plane is present.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
This molecule has a boron atom at the center with three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. The three-fold rotational symmetry (**C₃**) is evident. Additionally, since the molecule is planar, a horizontal mirror plane exists. This satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotational axis (**C₃**) due to its trigonal arrangement of bridges. However, the symmetry plane is likely vertical, not horizontal, meaning it belongs to the **C₃v** point group rather than **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) has both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it the molecule with **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
