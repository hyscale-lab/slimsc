Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question presents a density matrix ρ, which is given by (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what does this particular matrix look like?

Let me try to write it out. The |0⟩⟨0| term is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So when you add them together, each of those diagonal terms would be 1. Then multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal entry becomes 0.5. So the density matrix ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal.

Wait, but what does this represent? I think a density matrix with diagonal elements equal and off-diagonal zero might be a maximally mixed state. Because a maximally mixed state has equal probability in all basis states, right? So for a qubit, this would be the completely mixed state, which is like being in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where each point on the sphere corresponds to a different quantum state. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

So, the Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

Let me break this down. The identity matrix I is (1/2) times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| + |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0|), wait no, I think I'm mixing things up. Wait, the identity matrix for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So when you have ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, expanding that gives the components.

In our case, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me express that in terms of the identity matrix. Oh wait, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 would be [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. Which matches exactly the ρ matrix we have here. So that means the additional terms (the r·σ part) must be zero.

So if I write ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, and our ρ is I/2, then r·σ must be zero. That means r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which is represented by the origin. Because if you have no coherence and equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩, that's the center of the Bloch sphere. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This matrix has 0.5 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It represents a maximally mixed state, which is a classical mixture of the computational basis states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \), each with equal probability. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, qubit states are visualized as points in a geometrical space. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere: pure states lie on the surface, and mixed states lie inside.

For the given density matrix, since it is already \( \frac{I}{2} \), the additional terms involving \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) must be zero. This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is entirely zero, i.e., \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
