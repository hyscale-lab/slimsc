Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. But wait, the details are a bit fuzzy, so let me think through it step by step.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, Radius_1 = 1.5 * Radius_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But I'm not sure if mass plays a direct role here because the question is about luminosity, which relates more to temperature and radius, I think. Oh, wait, unless we're considering something like the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which connects luminosity, radius, and temperature.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. Since the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Or wait, does the fact that the stars are moving affect this peak wavelength? Oh wait, the problem also gives the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. So there's some Doppler shifting here, maybe. That could affect the observed wavelength.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But their actual emission peaks might be different because of their velocities. So perhaps I need to calculate their actual temperatures, considering the Doppler shift.

Let me think. Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Assuming that Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so v_r is positive. But Star_1 has no radial velocity, so v_r is 0.

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be longer. But the problem says the observed λ_max for both is the same. So how does that work?

Wait, no, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. So I need to compute their actual (rest) temperatures, considering the Doppler shift.

Hmm, let's denote:

λ_max1_observed = λ_max2_observed.

But λ_max1 = λ_max1_observed / (1 + v1/c), where v1 is Star_1's velocity. Similarly for λ_max2 = λ_max2_observed / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no, the formula for Doppler shift is a bit tricky. The observed wavelength depends on the direction of motion. If the star is moving towards us, the wavelength is blueshifted (λ decreases), and if moving away, it's redshifted (λ increases).

So for a star moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So for Star_1, since v1=0, λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_rest.

For Star_2, v2=700 km/s (assuming it's moving away, so positive v). So λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_rest * (1 + 700/c). But the problem states that λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs. So:

λ_max1_rest = λ_max2_rest * (1 + 700/c).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs comes from Star_1: since Star_1 is not moving, λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, which is moving away, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s. So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/c).

But I can also relate the rest wavelengths to their temperatures via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2: λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting back:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, the b's cancel out.

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So 1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

Hmm, solving for T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, no, let's rearrange:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that makes sense because if a star is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying lower temperature.

But wait, let me compute v2 in terms of c. 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light? Let's see, c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is 0.002333. So approximately 0.233% the speed of light.

So (1 + v2/c) is approximately 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333.

But wait, since the denominator is about 1.0023, T1 is roughly 0.9977 times T2. So T1 is about 0.9977 * T2. So the temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than that of Star_2.

Wait, but wait, I thought that when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, which implies lower temperature. So Star_2, moving away, would have a lower observed temperature, but in this case, the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, which is stationary. So Star_1's temperature must be higher than Star_2's.

Wait, but according to our equation, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). So if v2 is positive (moving away),
