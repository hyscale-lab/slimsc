Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are combinations of these.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state is the completely mixed state, which means it's equally likely to be found in any of the computational basis states, 0 or 1.

I also remember that the density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch representation expresses the density matrix in terms of a vector r with components (x, y, z) such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me break this down. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given ρ, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, I can compute each component.

Wait, let me compute each term. The identity matrix I is 2x2 and when multiplied by 1/2, I becomes (1/2) I. The other terms come from the Pauli matrices scaled by x, y, z respectively.

So, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. The |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

So ρ equals (I + 0 X + 0 Y + 0 Z)/2. Comparing this to ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, the vector r must be (0,0,0). Because all components x, y, z are zero.

Wait, but what about the Bloch sphere representation? The Bloch vector for a pure state would have a length of 1, pointing from the origin to the surface of the sphere. But for a maximally mixed state, the vector is at the origin. Because the density matrix is (I/2), so the Bloch vector is zero. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.

Just to double-check, the other options: Option B is (0,0,1) which would correspond to the state |1⟩⟨1|, but that's a pure state. Option A is (1,1,0) which doesn't look right. Option D is (1,1,1), which would be a state outside the Bloch sphere since the vector length would be sqrt(3) >1, which isn't allowed. So yeah, C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is a vector in 3D space, \( I \) is the identity matrix, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing the given \( \rho \) with this general form, it is evident that \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state being at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( r = (1,1,0) \))**: This does not match the given density matrix, as it would imply contributions from the Pauli matrices, which are absent here.
- **Option B (\( r = (0,0,1) \))**: This corresponds to the pure state \( |1\rangle\langle 1| \), which is not the case here.
- **Option C (\( r = (0,0,0) \))**: This correctly represents the maximally mixed state, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.
- **Option D (\( r = (1,1,1) \))**: This would correspond to a state outside the Bloch sphere, as the vector length exceeds 1, which is not physically valid.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector for the given density matrix is \( (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
