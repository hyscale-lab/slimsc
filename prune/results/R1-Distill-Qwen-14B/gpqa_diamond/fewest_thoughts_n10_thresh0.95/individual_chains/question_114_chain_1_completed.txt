Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me think through it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So, that looks like a substitution reaction. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the ketone is attacked by CN-.

But wait, ketones usually aren't that reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. Oh, unless it's under some specific conditions. Oh, right! Maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the mechanism would be that the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, for the first step, reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, reagents A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, no, I think H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, so NaHSO3 would be the sodium bisulfite. Hmm, but in this case, for the cyanohydrin formation, I think we need an acid catalyst. So probably H3O+ is the right choice for A.

Wait, but wait, another thought. I've heard that sometimes, when using NaCN, the reaction can be done under basic conditions. But in this case, the product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group adjacent. So for the cyanohydrin formation, which requires an acid catalyst, like H+.

So in the first step, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Let's look at the second reaction.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So what reagent would convert a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid?

I think the process usually involves hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either acidic or basic, and sometimes using H2O with heat.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So when it's treated with H2O and reagent B, perhaps it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile. Let me think: hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions, often with heat.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done with H2O and HCl (acidic conditions) or with NaOH (basic conditions). Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's more likely that the reaction is done under acidic conditions because the hydroxyl group would be deprotonated in basic conditions, but if the starting material already has a hydroxyl group, maybe that's part of the structure.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is (PhCH2)C(OH)CH2-CN. When we hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the product becomes (PhCH2)C(OH)CH2-COOH. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for that are either H2O under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic hydrolysis usually uses HCl and heat, whereas basic uses NaOH and then acid workup.

Looking back at the question, the reagent B is H2O, but what's the other component? The options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. So in the options, reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid.

So, in the second reaction, reagent B would be HCl because when nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic conditions, HCl is often used as the acid. For example, using H2O with HCl as the acid catalyst.

Wait, but another point: the presence of the hydroxyl group in the starting material. If the reaction is hydrolyzing the nitrile, but the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon, perhaps the reaction conditions don't protonate that. So HCl would provide the acidic environment needed for the nitrile hydrolysis.

So for the second reagent, B is HCl. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → So first step is acid (H3O+), second is HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → So A is NaHSO3, which is an acid (sulfuric acid is strong, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, maybe?)

Wait, but for the first reaction, we thought A should be an acid. So option C has A as NaHSO3. HSO3^- is a weaker acid, pKa around 1.8, I think. H3O+ is a stronger acid (pH around 0). So which is better for the cyanohydrin formation?

I think the reaction with NaCN and a ketone usually requires an acid. So which acid? I've read that sometimes H2SO4 is used, but other times HCl or H3O+ is used as the acid. Alternatively, maybe the NaHSO3 could act as a source of H+ as well. So perhaps either A is H3O+ or NaHSO3 could be possible.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the correct reagent for B is HCl. So looking at the options, which have B as HCl? Option A and C.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → both steps use H3O+ and HCl.

But wait, the second reaction's reagent is only H2O and B. So in the second reaction, the conditions are H2O and B. So if B is HCl, then it's H2O and HCl, which is an acidic aqueous solution. That makes sense for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So in that case, for the second reaction, the right B is HCl, so looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl.

Now, for the first reaction, the reagent A when B is HCl can be either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but when you add NaCN to a ketone, you typically use an acid catalyst. So if A is H3O+, that's a strong acid. Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, but could still provide H+.

But does NaHSO3 work for the cyanohydrin formation? Hmm. Let's think: the cyanohydrin reaction. The mechanism requires the ketone to be protonated, making it more electrophilic. So any acid that can donate a proton would work.

H3O+ is a strong acid and would definitely protonate the carbonyl. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid; but in solution, it would dissociate into H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but wait. If the solution is aqueous, and the ketone is a relatively poor nucleophile, perhaps the stronger acid is needed to effectively protonate the carbonyl. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. For example, in some cases, H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) is used, but NaHSO3 might be a source of H+ at a lower pH.

So in the first reaction, the presence of NaCN and A (either H3O+ or NaHSO3) as the acid.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → both acids. So first step is acid, second is HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → first step is NaHSO3, second is HCl.

Wait, but what's the role of NaHSO3? It's a source of H+ and SO3^2- (bisulfite). But in an aqueous solution, NaHSO3 would provide H+ and HSO3^-.

So for the first reaction, whether H3O+ or NaHSO3 is the reagent A depends on which is the correct acid for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, what's the product in the first reaction?

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN with acid would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is a cyanohydrin.

So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + NaCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So the correct reagent for A is an acid. So which option provides the correct acid for both steps?

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is H3O+; B is HCl.

So, first reaction uses H3O+ and NaCN. That would be H+ from H3O+ acting as the acid catalyst, allowing the attack of CN- on the carbonyl.

Second reaction uses H2O and HCl. So that's the acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid.

That makes sense. So in the first reaction, H3O+ is the acid (A), and in the second reaction, HCl is the reagent (B).

So the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes the cyanohydrin formation uses a different acid. Could it be that the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid, making A NaHSO3?

Alternatively, perhaps I should check whether NaHSO3 is a suitable acid for this reaction. Well, in the presence of NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid than H3O+, would it effectively protonate the carbonyl group of the ketone?

But the ketone's carbonyl is already a good enough electrophile that a weaker acid might still protonate it, but perhaps it's not as efficient as a strong acid. So I'm not entirely certain. But given the options, and considering that in the second reaction, B must be HCl, the only options that have B as HCl are options A and C.

Now, what's the role of B in the second reaction? The reaction is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions are H2O and B.

So, for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are either with H2O and HCl (acidic) or with NaOH followed by acid (basic). Since the product is a carboxylic acid, and the reagent B is HCl, it's likely that the reaction is under acidic conditions.

So, for the second step, B is HCl. Therefore, in the options, only options A and C have B as HCl.

Now, for the first step, the options A and C have A as H3O+ and NaHSO3 respectively.

Which of these would be suitable for the cyanohydrin formation?

I think that H3O+ is a stronger acid and would effectively protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the attack by CN-.

So, if A is H3O+ (option A), that would make sense. But wait, what if the reaction doesn't require such a strong acid? Or maybe NaHSO3 is sufficient. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction doesn't require the strong acid, and NaHSO3 could be used. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another possibility: what if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the reagent A? Then, the solution is acidic but with a higher pH, which might not be as effective. Hmm.

But without a strong acid, the reaction might not proceed as efficiently. So perhaps the correct option is A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

But looking at the options again, option A says A is H3O+, B is HCl. So first step uses H3O+ (acid), second step uses HCl (acid for hydrolysis).

That seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, wait but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide group would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So the first reaction is correct.

In the second reaction, the starting material has a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So when it's treated with H2O and HCl, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the product is (PhCH2)COOH.

So the reagents for the first reaction are NaCN and H3O+ (A), and for the second reaction, H2O and HCl (B).

So the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it effectively provides the necessary protons for the reaction. NaHSO₃, while acidic, is a weaker acid and less likely to efficiently catalyze the reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions. HCl is the appropriate reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Considering the options, only options A and C have B as HCl. However, for the first reaction, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is more suitable than NaHSO₃ for the cyanohydrin formation. Therefore, the correct answer is option A, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
