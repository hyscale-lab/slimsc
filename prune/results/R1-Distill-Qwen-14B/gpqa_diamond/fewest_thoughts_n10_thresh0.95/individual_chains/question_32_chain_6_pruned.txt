Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember from my studies that RHIC collides heavy ions at relativistic speeds. The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li typically has 3 protons because it's lithium-6 or something. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, since 3 protons plus 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of this Li nucleus is 0.96c. Oh right, relativistic speeds require using the relativistic energy equations. 

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton. Wait, but protons and neutrons are slightly different, but for heavy ions, sometimes people approximate the mass as A * proton mass. Let me get the exact value.

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Neutrons are a bit heavier, around 939 MeV/c². But for a Li-6 nucleus, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be 3*(938) +3*(939) MeV/c². Let me compute that. 

3*938 is 2814. 3*939 is 2817. So adding them gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV/c². So about 5.631 GeV/c² since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 might be a bit different because binding energy comes into play. Oh, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's assumed that we can approximate the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. Alternatively, maybe I should use the atomic mass. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a lithium nucleus as given by the periodic table.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², the rest mass energy would be 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

So let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.11. So total is 5589 +12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is about 5.601 GeV. Hmm, so about 5.6 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. The nucleus is moving at 0.96c. We need to find the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 0.28 times 3.5714 is approximately 1, right? Let me check: 0.28 * 3.5714. Let me compute 0.28 *3.5714. 3 *0.28 is 0.84, 0.5714 *0.28 is about 0.16. So total around 1.0. So yes, gamma is 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma * m_rest * c². Since m_rest is 5.6 GeV/c², E is 3.5714 * 5.6 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6. Hmm, 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6, and 0.0714 *5.6 is approximately 0.401. So total is approximately 19.6 + 0.401 = 20.001 GeV. Wait, but that's an approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 3.5714 *5.6.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857
3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284
Adding, 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (exactly 20.0). Hmm, that's interesting. So E is 20 GeV?

Wait, but wait, I'm not considering the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857... So approximately 3.57142857.

So, mass is 5.601 GeV/c² (from earlier calculation when I considered the exact mass of Li-6). Let me use that.

So E = gamma * m_rest c².

m_rest c² is 5.601 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.601 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 * 5.601.

Let me compute this step by step.

5.601 *3.57142857.

I can write 3.57142857 as approximately 35/10, but 35/10 is 3.5. Wait, 3.57142857 is exactly 25/7. Because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, 25 divided by 7 is 3.57142857... So yes, 25/7.

So 5.601 *25/7.

5.601 *25 = 140.025.

Then, 140.025 divided by 7 is approximately 20.00357 GeV.

So about 20.0036 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 18.475 GeV.

Option B is 23.069 GeV.

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Option D is 21.419.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 20.0036 GeV, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, earlier I used 6.013 u for Li-6. Let me confirm that.

The atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.01325 u. So more precisely, 6.01325 u.

So m_rest c² is 6.01325 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01325 *931.5.

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.01325 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.00325 *931.5 = approx 3.025875. So total is 9.315 +3.025875=12.340875. So total m_rest c² is 5589 +12.340875 = 5601.340875 MeV, which is 5.601340875 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.601340875 GeV.

Compute this:

Let me compute 5.601340875 *3.57142857.

I'll do this multiplication more accurately.

5.601340875 *3 =16.8039
5.601340875 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.601340875 * (4/7) = (5.601340875 *4)/7 = 22.4053635 /7 ≈ 3.200766214.

So total E is approximately 16.8039 +3.200766214 = 20.00466621 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, it's 20.0047 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Option D is 21.419, which is even higher.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Because in particle physics, when colliders are discussed, the energy per particle or per ion is what's considered. Also, sometimes the kinetic energy and total energy can be confused.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". RHIC collides two beams, so perhaps the total center-of-mass energy is what's being referred to. But the question states the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Wait, but in a collider, the particles are moving in opposite directions. So each has energy E, and the total energy would be higher.

Hmm, wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So perhaps it is referring to the kinetic energy per nucleus. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, in colliders, the energy is usually given as the energy per beam. So each nucleus has energy E, and when they collide, the center-of-mass energy is higher. But the problem states the speed is 0.96c. So each nucleus is moving at speed v, which is 0.96c.

Wait, I think the question is asking for the total energy of each nucleus, i.e., gamma*m*c². So each nucleus has energy E = gamma * m c². So for RHIC, each beam would have E = ~20 GeV, as I computed.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass. Let me check again.

Wait, the mass of Li-6: exact value? From the periodic table, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01325 u. So 6.01325 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01325 * 931.5:

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01325 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.00325 *931.5 = approx 3.025875. So total is 12.340875.

So 5589 +12.340875 =5601.340875 MeV =5.601340875 GeV.

So E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 *5.601340875.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601340875.

Hmm, 3.57142857 is 25/7, right? So 25/7 *5.601340875 = (25 *5.601340875)/7.

25 *5.601340875 = let's compute 5.601340875 *25.

5 *25 =125.

0.601340875 *25 =15.033521875.

So total is 125 +15.033521875 = 140.033521875.

Divide that by 7: 140.033521875 /7.

140 /7 is 20. 0.033521875 /7 is approximately 0.0047888.

So total is 20.0047888 GeV.

So approximately 20.0048 GeV. Rounded to four decimal places, 20.0048 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than this. Option D is 21.419. Hmm, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Wait, another possibility. The nucleus is Li-6, but perhaps the question refers to the actual mass, including electrons.

Wait, Li-6 as a nucleus (Li-6 ion) has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and the electrons would be around it. But when considering heavy ions in a collider, the mass is dominated by the nucleons, and electrons contribute very little. So perhaps I should ignore the electrons. So the mass calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) again.

v =0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, as before.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571.

No mistake there.

So E = 3.571428571 *5.601340875 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this more precisely.

5.601340875 *3.571428571.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

5 *3.571428571 = 17.857142855.

0.601340875 *3.571428571.

Compute 0.6 *3.571428571 = 2.1428571426.

0.001340875 *3.571428571 ≈ 0.004785714.

So total for 0.601340875 *3.571428571 ≈ 2.1428571426 + 0.004785714 = 2.1476428566.

So adding 17.857142855 and 2.1476428566: 17.857142855 +2.1476428566 =20.00478571 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.00478571 GeV.

So about 20.0048 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, but that's higher than my calculation.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Because the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which could be the kinetic energy. Hmm, but RHIC's energy is typically given as the total energy per beam, including rest mass.

Wait, the problem asks for the
