Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, with different exponents of 1/plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, for a given plx range, how many stars are there?

If the stars are uniformly distributed, that might mean that the number density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But since we're dealing with parallax, which relates to distance, I need to relate volume to parallax.

Let me think about how volume relates to parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Volume in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. But since we're considering a change in parallax, let's see how dr relates to plx.

Wait, plx is 1/d. So, if I have a small change in plx, dplx, then how does that relate to dd (the change in distance)? Let's compute that. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the thickness in distance, dd, is proportional to 1/(plx²) times dplx. But wait, when plx increases, the distance decreases, so maybe I should think about how the number of stars in a certain plx range depends on that.

The number of stars should be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume is 4π d² * dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). But wait, the negative just indicates the direction of change, which doesn't matter for the magnitude here. So volume is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. That's (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, that's the volume element for a shell at distance d with thickness dr. So, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So, number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to the volume per unit plx.

Wait, but the question is about number per unit range of plx. So, maybe I should find N/Δplx, where N is the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + Δplx.

The volume of the shell (for a thin shell) would be 4π d^2 * dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd = -d (dplx) because plx = 1/d, so dplx = -dd/d². Rearranging, dd = -d² dplx. But substituting d =1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ). The negative just indicates direction, so the volume element is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/(plx^4) times dplx. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4) times dplx / dplx = 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of plx". So for a small dplx, the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx is (1/plx^4) * dplx / dplx = 1/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would be option A.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. If the number of stars is uniform in space, then the number in a volume element dV is n * dV, where n is constant. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. Here, r = distance. Parallax plx is 1/r, so r =1/plx. So, dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So substituting r and dr into the volume element:

dV =4π (r)^2 dr =4π (1/plx)^2 * (−1/plx² dplx) )= 4π (1/(plx^4)) dplx.

So the number of stars in a plx interval dplx is n * dV = n *4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is n *4π/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the correct option is A, ~1/plx^4.

Wait a second, but another approach: the number density is stars per volume. So if you have more volume as you go to lower plx (since plx is smaller for more distant stars), the number of stars per unit plx would decrease. Because as plx gets smaller, the same volume element (in terms of plx) corresponds to a larger physical volume. So the number per unit plx would be 1/(plx^4), as I found earlier.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. The volume of the shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume element is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This shows that the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
