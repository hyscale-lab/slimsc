Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, right? The star moves in response to the planet's gravity, and that causes the spectral lines to shift back and forth.

So the question says we have two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So I need to find the ratio of their periods, P2/P1.

I think the RV method gives us the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (P planet^-1/3) * (M planet) * (M star)^-2/3) divided by some constant. Or wait, more accurately, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 (AU))^ (1/3) ) ) / (1 day^(1/3)) ) * ... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the Doppler shift.

I think the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the velocity of the star. The shift is given by delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, right? So delta lambda = (v/c) * lambda. But since the shifts are given in milliangstroms, which is a change in wavelength, and the original wavelength is the same for both stars because they're looking at the same spectral line.

Wait, but in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. The Doppler shift is given by delta lambda / lambda = K / c, but I'm not sure if I need to compute K from the delta lambda. Alternatively, maybe the delta lambda is directly proportional to K because the original wavelength is the same.

So, delta_lambda = (K / c) * lambda. Since the stars are the same, lambda is the same, so delta_lambda is proportional to K. Therefore, if planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms and planet #1's is 5, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but how does K relate to the orbital period? I think K depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (P/(2 pi c^3)) ) ]^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the simplified form for K. Since the stars are Sun-like, M_star is much larger than M_p (Neptune mass is much smaller than Sun), so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) =1. So the formula simplifies.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * [something else?]

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

K = ( (2 pi G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the relationship between K and the period. Since both stars have the same mass, M_star, and the planets have the same mass, M_p.

So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1) * (M_star)^(-2/3) * (P)^(-1/3) ) , or wait no, let me get the formula right.

Wait, the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Hmm, I'm not confident about that. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Wait, think about the Doppler shift and how it relates to the star's velocity. The star's velocity K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i)/( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / c^3 )^(1/3) * ( M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3))
