Okay, so I have this question about a metric in general relativity, and I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy, so the spacetime here is two-dimensional, maybe like a surface in higher dimensions?

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. The area of a surface would involve integrating over that space. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the metric given.

Wait, pseudosphere in this context might refer to a specific solution in relativity, like the Schwarzschild solution or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the term "pseudosphere" is being used here in a mathematical sense, perhaps as a surface with a specific metric. Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant "sphere," but that's just a guess.

Wait, looking at the metric: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks a bit like the metric for a sphere in some way. For example, the standard metric on a sphere sometimes has terms like (R² - x² - y²) in the denominator when using certain coordinates. But I'm not sure.

Hold on, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So radius 2, which makes me think about the denominator here. 4 is 2 squared, right? So 4 - x² - y² = 2² - x² - y². That seems reminiscent of the metric for a sphere of radius 2 in two dimensions, but perhaps in some coordinate system where the metric is written this way.

Wait, but this metric is a bit different. Let me think about the form. The line element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). But in the standard metric for a sphere, the coefficient is (something)/(R² - x² - y²), which looks similar but perhaps with a different numerator.

Wait, maybe this is a metric for a two-dimensional space with a specific curvature. Let me think about the form of the metric for a space of constant curvature. In 2D, the metric can be written in terms of polar coordinates as ds² = dr² + (a² - r²)²/(a²) dθ², where a is a constant related to the radius. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is conformally flat, since it's of the form f(x,y)(dx² + dy²). So conformal to the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Which would affect the area calculation.

Wait, the area in a conformal metric is given by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But since this is 2D, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal elements. For the metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². In this case, since the off-diagonal terms are zero (the metric is diagonal), the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, but to compute the area, I need to integrate the square root of the determinant over the area. Wait no, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So in this case, sqrt(g_xx g_yy) is sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) ) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator (4 - x² - y²) must be positive because otherwise the metric would be singular or imaginary. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2, centered at the origin.

Wait, but the integral is over the entire disk, so the area would be the integral from x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Let me think about how to compute this integral. Maybe using polar coordinates would be easier. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

Because dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the θ integral is straightforward. ∫0^2π dθ = 2π.

So the area A = ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r * 2π dr.

Simplify that: A = 64π ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, what is ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr? Let me think. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr] / (4 - r²) = (-1/2) ∫ du / u.

Which is (-1/2) ln|u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2: 4 - (2)^2 =0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait a minute, that's a problem.

Wait, so when r approaches 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches zero from the positive side, so ln(4 - r²) approaches negative infinity. So the integral ∫0^2 would be from 0 to 2, so as r approaches 2, the denominator goes to zero.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. When r=0, u=4. When r approaches 2, u approaches 0.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) du ].

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

But ln(4) is fine, but ln(0) is -infinity. So the integral becomes (1/2) [ ln(4) - (-infty) ) ] = (1/2)( ln(4) + ∞ ), which is infinity. So the integral diverges.

Wait, so the area is 64π times infinity, which would be infinity. But looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the area would be infinite.

But wait, what's the question again? The area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the metric given must represent a pseudosphere, which perhaps has infinite area?

But why would that be the case? I thought pseudospheres have finite area, but maybe in this case, the metric leads to an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric given is for a two-dimensional space (since it's dx² + dy²), so the "pseudosphere" here is a two-dimensional surface. But the integral for the area is diverging, which suggests that the area is infinite. But that doesn't make sense if it's a pseudosphere. Or does it?

Wait, maybe I got the wrong interpretation. Perhaps the question refers to the area of a sphere in some space described by this metric. But if the area is infinite, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the radius of the pseudosphere. The user mentions radius r=2, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 2² - (x² + y²). So perhaps the radius of the sphere (in some sense) is 2, but the area is still diverging.

Wait, another angle: in relativity, sometimes the area is considered as the coordinate area, but in this case, the area integral seems to be divergent.

So putting it all together, the calculation leads to the area being infinite, so the answer should be D) +infty.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Region of Definition**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must be positive to avoid singularities, so \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the \( (x, y) \)-plane.

2. **Area Element**: For a metric of the form \( ds^2 = f(x, y) \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right) \), the area element is \( dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \). Since the metric is diagonal, \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and thus:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

3. **Integral for Area**: The total area is the integral of \( dA \) over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \):
   \[
   A = \int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

4. **Switching to Polar Coordinates**: Using \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Integral**:
   - The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \).
   - The radial integral is:
     \[
     \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
     \]
   - Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and the integral becomes:
     \[
     64\pi \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = 64\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{2u} \, du.
     \]

6. **Divergence of the Integral**: The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This means the area is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
