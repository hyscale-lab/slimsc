Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem says we have ten thousand identical systems. Each system has a particle that behaves under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. They use 'i' as the square root of -1, which I remember is the imaginary unit. 

Wait a second, the wave function has an imaginary part. Oh, right, wave functions can be complex, but for probabilities, we usually look at the modulus squared, which involves the complex conjugate. But in this case, maybe the wave function isn't normalized yet.

The important part is that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. That means the wave function must be zero outside the interval [1,3]. Wait, no. Oh, no, wait. They found that when measuring, all particles were in x between 1 and 3. So the wave function must have support only in that region. That suggests that the wave function is zero elsewhere, but looking at the given expression, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit puzzling because if it's just a simple expression, maybe it's non-zero outside 1 to 3. But wait, perhaps the wave function is zero outside [1,3], but the given expression is valid within that region.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for the region where the particle exists, which is x between 1 and 3. But in reality, for the wave function to be normalizable, especially in regions outside 1 and 3, it must drop to zero. Wait, but the problem states that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is as given. Oh, so perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Which suggests that the wave function has an imaginary part. That's a little unusual because real wave functions are more common in such problems, but okay, maybe it's a complex wave function.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, and the probability density is the modulus squared. So for a particle in a region where it's found, the wave function is given. But perhaps that's only the part where it's non-zero. So the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because when measuring, all the particles are found in that region.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "the wave function... can be described as..." So I think ψ(x) is given as that expression only for x between 1 and 3, and zero outside. So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem is to find the value of 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because wave functions must be normalized, meaning the integral of |ψ(x)|² from -infty to +infty is 1.

So since ψ is zero outside [1,3], the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i, the complex conjugate is [a/sqrt(1+x)] +0.5i. So when I multiply ψ by its conjugate, I get [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms would be imaginary and would cancel out when adding. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, let me compute that again. Let me represent ψ as A + B i, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5. Then the conjugate is A - B i. So ψ * conjugate = A² + B². Because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². So, in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So A squared is a²/(1 + x), B squared is (0.5)^2=0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x), yes. And (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So yes, that's correct.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts: a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 times the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. Evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, but wait: No, the integral is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx. So the first term is a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) = a² ln(2). The second term is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 → 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. Let me think about the numerical value. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Therefore, a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's compute that: sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i, right? So yes, when I compute |ψ|², it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so |B|^2 is (0.5)^2.

So the integral is correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function has both real and imaginary parts. So ψ(x) is a complex function, but the modulus squared is the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts. So yes, the integral is correct.

So the calculation seems right. So a² is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213, a ≈ 0.849. Closest to option B, 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3, \quad \text{and zero otherwise.}
\]

The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over all space must equal 1. Since \(\psi(x)\) is zero outside the interval \([1, 3]\), the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of \(\psi(x)\) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\),
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\).

### First Integral:
The integral of \(\frac{a^2}{1+x}\) is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
The integral of \(0.25\) is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two parts gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to option **B) 0.85**.
