Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? It has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Only one hemisphere is spotted, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. These variations can look like an exoplanet transiting the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same drop in brightness when it transits.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So the fractional change in brightness is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. So the observed brightness variation isn't just the planet's effect but the spots' effect. So I need to calculate the equivalent effect of the spots on the brightness and set that equal to the planet's effect.

Let me think about the spotted star first. The star's brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness is slightly less than when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, the problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. Oh, right, so each spot has a certain area, and their combined area on the hemisphere is 20% of that hemisphere.

But actually, the variation in brightness would depend on the temperature difference and how much area is covered.

The star's total flux when spots are visible is lower. The effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But wait, no, wait: the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spots are at 5000 K, and the rest of the star is at 6000 K.

The brightness variation occurs when the spotted hemisphere comes into view. So when the star rotates, the spotted side faces us, and the other side is the normal temperature.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So when only one hemisphere is spotted, the other hemisphere is unspotted. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the same as when it's not? No, wait, no. Because the observed flux depends on which hemisphere we're seeing.

Wait, no. The star's brightness as observed is the sum of the flux from all the areas we can see. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, a certain fraction of the star's disk is cooler. So the flux during that time is lower.

So the change in flux (ΔF) would be the difference between the normal flux (when no spots are visible) and the flux during when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, but wait, no. Because the star's other hemisphere isn't spotted. So when the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is maximum. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is lower.

Wait, no. The star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere is spotted, with 20% coverage (filling factor), then the spotted area on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The rest of that hemisphere (80%) is unspotted, so 0.16πR². The other hemisphere is completely unspotted, contributing 2πR².

So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted part of the spotted hemisphere plus the entire unspotted hemisphere. When the other hemisphere is facing, the flux is higher because the spotted area is not visible.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, when the star is observed, the visible hemisphere is either the spotted one or the unspotted one. Oh wait, no, because the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view as the star spins. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area that's covered by spots is 0.2 of that hemisphere. The rest is normal.

Wait, actually, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One, let's say, the front hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, and the back hemisphere has no spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view, and the brightness drops because a portion of the light we receive is from cooler spots.

So, to compute the brightness variation, we need to calculate the flux when the spotted side is visible and compare it to when the unspotted side is visible.

The star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is the flux from the entire unspotted hemisphere (which is (2π R²) * σ T_eff^4 ) plus the flux from the spotted hemisphere's unspotted part (0.8 * 2π R² * σ T_eff^4). Wait, no, wait. No, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere is the spotted one, so the flux is (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ) + (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) plus the flux from the back hemisphere, which is unspotted, so 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere has 20% spots (at 5000 K) and 80% unspotted (6000 K). The back hemisphere is completely unspotted (6000 K). So the total flux is:

Front hemisphere: (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4

Back hemisphere: 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is entirely unspotted, so:

Front hemisphere: 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

Back hemisphere: 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

Wait, no, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the back hemisphere is the spotted one. So when the unspotted side is visible, the front is unspotted, the back is spotted. But wait, no, because the star is a sphere, when you see the front hemisphere, the back is the other side, which is the same as if the front were the spotted one.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it differently. The star's entire surface is 4π R². The spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The rest of the star is at 6000 K.

So when the spotted area is facing the observer, the total flux is:

Flux_spotted = (Flux from spotted regions) + (Flux from unspotted regions)

Flux_spotted = (0.4π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (4π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ (6000)^4

Wait, no, because the star's surface is 4π R². The spotted area is 0.4π R². So:

Flux_spotted = [0.4π R² * (5000)^4] * σ + [ (4π R² - 0.4π R²) * (6000)^4 ] * σ 

And the flux when the star is unspotted (i.e., the unspotted hemisphere is facing) would be higher because the spots are on the far side, so not affecting the flux we receive. So in that case, the flux is:

Flux_unspotted = 4π R² * (6000)^4 * σ

Wait, no. When the star is unspotted in our view, it means that the entire front side (2π R²) is at 6000 K, and the back (2π R²) is also at 6000 K. But when the spotted hemisphere is facing, the front has 0.2 * 2π R² at 5000 K, and the back is 2π R² at 6000 K.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's compute the average flux when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere and when it's viewed with the unspotted.

The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Compute the flux difference between these two scenarios.

So, let's compute Flux_max (unspotted) and Flux_min (spotted).

Flux_max = 4π R² σ (6000)^4

Flux_min = [ (4π R² - 0.4π R²) * (6000)^4 + 0.4π R² * (5000)^4 ] * σ

Wait, because when the spotted hemisphere is facing, 0.4π R² is at 5000 K, and the rest (3.6π R²) is at 6000 K.

So the change in flux (ΔF_spot) is Flux_max - Flux_min.

Wait, no, the change would be the difference during the spot transit. Wait, no, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when we have the maximum coverage of spots. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not. So the amplitude (ΔF_spot) is Flux_unspotted - Flux_spotted.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots come into view, causing a dip in flux. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

So, during the time when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So, the amplitude (ΔF) is Flux_max - Flux_min.

Let me compute Flux_max and Flux_min.

Flux_max = 4π R² * σ (6000)^4

Flux_min = [ (4π R² - 0.4π R²) * (6000)^4 + 0.4π R² * (5000)^4 ]

Which simplifies to:

Flux_min = [3.6 π R² (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² (5000^4)] * σ

So, ΔF_spot = Flux_max - Flux_min = [4π R² (6000^4) - (3.6π R² 6000^4 + 0.4π R² 5000^4)] * σ

Factor out π R² σ:

ΔF_spot = π R² σ [4*6000^4 - (3.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

4*6000^4 = 4 * (6e3)^4
3.6*6000^4 = 3.6 * (6e3)^4
0.4*5000^4 = 0.4 * (5e3)^4

So,

4*6e3^4 - (3.6 *6e3^4 + 0.4 *5e3^4)
= (4 -3.6) *6e3^4 - 0.4 *5e3^4
= 0.4 * (6e3^4) - 0.4 *5e3^4
= 0.4 [ (6e3^4) - (5e3^4) ]

So,

ΔF_spot = π R² σ * 0.4 [6e3^4 -5e3^4]

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, 4*6^4 = 4 * 1296 = 5184 (if 6 is in thousands, but perhaps better to compute the exact numbers).

Wait, perhaps to calculate the ratio between (6000^4) and (5000^4):

(6000^4) = (6)^4 * (10^3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15

Similarly, 5000^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14

So,

6000^4 = 1.296e15
5000^4 = 6.25e14

So, the difference is 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14

So,

ΔF_spot = π R² σ * 0.4 * 6.71e14

But wait, 0.4 comes from 0.4 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4) ?

Wait, wait, 0.4 comes from 0.4*(6e3^4 - 5e3^4) ?

Wait, let me re-express:

ΔF_spot = π R² σ * [4*6e3^4 -3.6*6e3^4 -0.4*5e3^4]

= π R² σ * [ (4-3.6)*6e3^4 -0.4*5e3^4 ]

Which is,

= π R² σ * (0.4 *6e3^4 - 0.4*5e3^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (1.296e15 -6.25e14 )

Which is 0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14 )

Hmm, 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14

So, ΔF_spot = π R² σ * 2.684e14

Wait, but for the planet transit scenario, the change in flux is ΔF_planet = (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. F_total is the total flux of the star (when not spotted). So F_total = 4π R_s² σ T_eff^4

Wait, but in the planet case, the star is unspotted, so F_total is the star's full flux.

So, for the planet transit, the change in flux is:

ΔF_planet = (R_p / R_s)^2 * F_total

We want ΔF_planet = ΔF_spot.

So,

(R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total = 0.4 π R_s² σ (6.71e14 )

Wait, let me make sure. Let's write F_total as 4π R_s² σ (6000)^4.

So,

ΔF_planet = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * 4π R_s² σ (6000)^4

= 4 π R_p^2 σ (6000)^4

Set this equal to ΔF_spot:

4 π R_p^2 σ (6000)^4 = 0.4 π R_s² σ (6.71e14 )

Hmm, but wait, let me re-express the right-hand side (RHS) using the actual T values.

Wait, earlier, I computed ΔF_spot as 0.4 π R_s² σ (6.71e14 ), where 6.71e14 is 6000^4 -5000^4.

Wait, 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14 → so 6.71e14 is the difference.

So, 0.4 * (6.71e14 ) = 2.684e14.

So,

ΔF_spot = π R_s² σ * 2.684e14

So,

4 π R_p^2 σ (6000)^4 = π R_s^2 σ * 2.684e14

We can cancel π and σ from both sides:

4 R_p^2 (6000^4) = R_s^2 (2.684e14 )

We want R_p / R_s, let me denote x = R_p / R_s.

So,

4 (x^2) (6000^4) = R_s^2 (2.684e14 )

Wait, no, wait. Let's plug in:

Left side: 4 * x² * (6000^4 )

Right side: R_s² * 2.684e14

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, let's be precise.

ΔF_planet = (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total

F_total = 4 π R_s² σ (6000)^4

So,

ΔF_planet = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * 4 π R_s² σ (6000)^4 = 4 π R_p^2 σ (6000)^4

ΔF_spot = 0.4 π R_s^2 σ (6.71e14 )

Set them equal:

4 π R_p^2 σ (6000^4) = 0.4 π R_s^2 σ (6.71e14 )

Cancel π, σ:

4 R_p^2 (6000^4) = 0.4 R_s^2 (6.71e14 )

Then,

R_p^2 = [ 0.4 R_s^2 (6.71e14) ] / [4 (6000^4) ]

Compute the right side:

First, 0.4 /4 = 0.1

So,

R_p^2 = 0.1 R_s^2 (6.71e14) / (6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15

So,

R_p^2 = 0.1 R_s^2 * (6.71e14) / (1.296e15 )

Compute 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = (6.71 / 1296) * 10^(-1) = approx 0.00518

Wait, 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = 6.71 / 12960 = wait, 1.296e15 is 1296e12, and 6.71e14 is 671e12.

So,

671e12 / 1296e12 = 671 / 1296 ≈ 0.5176

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.296e15 is 1.296 * 10^15, and 6.71e14 is 6.71 * 10^14, so 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = (6.71 / 12.96) * (10^14 / 10^15) )= (0.5177) * 0.1 → approx 0.05177.

So,

R_p^2 = 0.1 * R_s^2 * 0.05177

0.1 * 0.05177 = 0.005177

So,

R_p^2 = 0.005177 R_s^2

Take the square root: R_p = sqrt(0.005177) R_s

sqrt(0.005177) ≈ 0.07196

So approximately 0.072 R_s.

Wait, so R_p / R_s ≈ 0.072, which is about 7% of the star's radius.

Looking at the options, option B is ~0.07, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Let me recompute 6.71e14 / 1.296e15.

Wait, 6.71e14 is 671e12, 1.296e15 is 1296e12.

So 671e12 / 1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5177.

Wait, that's 0.5177. Oh wait, no! Because 6.71e14 is 6.71 *1e14, and 1.296e15 is 1.296 *1e15. So 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = (
