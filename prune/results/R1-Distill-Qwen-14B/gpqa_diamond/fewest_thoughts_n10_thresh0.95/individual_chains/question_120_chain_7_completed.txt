Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. Let me think about what I know regarding parallax and how it relates to the number of stars.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth during the course of a year. I remember that the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so distance d = 1/plx. Oh right, because a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's like how many stars are there in a certain range of parallax values. Wait, but since stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their actual density in space is uniform? Or is it uniform in the sky as viewed from Earth? Hmm, the question says they're uniformly distributed in the sky, so I think that refers to their apparent distribution, not their physical spatial distribution.

But wait, stars are at various distances from us, so their apparent distribution isn't the same as their actual spatial distribution. If stars are spread out uniformly in space, their distribution as seen from Earth would depend on their distances because closer stars would appear more spread out, or maybe more concentrated?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number of stars in a spherical shell at a distance d would depend on the volume. The volume of a shell is 4πd²Δd. So the number of stars would be proportional to 4πd²Δd, assuming uniform density.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d. So if we consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a range of distance from d to d + Δd, with Δd being approximately 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. Wait, maybe I should express Δd in terms of plx. Let me try to compute that.

Let me let plx = p. So d = 1/p. Then, if plx increases by a small amount Δp, the distance changes from d to d + Δd. What's Δd in terms of Δp?

Using calculus, the derivative of d with respect to p is dd/dp = -1/p². So Δd ≈ - (1/p²) Δp. Hmm, but since plx increases as the star is closer, a small increase in plx corresponds to a small decrease in distance. Wait, but the exact expression might not matter right now.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4πd² Δd, where n is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume). Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, n is a constant.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, for a given range of plx, say from p to p + Δp, how many stars are there?

We can calculate the number of stars in the corresponding distance range. The number of stars between p and p + Δp is N = n * 4πd² * Δd.

But d = 1/p, so d² is 1/p².

And Δd is approximately -(1/p²) Δp. Wait, because Δd = d(p + Δp) - d(p) = (1/(p+Δp)) - (1/p) ≈ -Δp/(p²) when Δp is small.

But since we're dealing with a small Δp, the approximation holds. So substituting:

N ≈ n * 4π * (1/p²) * (-Δp / p² )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, so the shell thickness is positive. So I can take the absolute value, and N ≈ n * 4π * (1/p²) * (Δp / p² )

Which simplifies to N ≈ (4π n) * (Δp) / p^4.

So N is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx (Δp) changes with plx. So the number per unit Δp would be N/Δp ≈ (4πn ) / p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to p^4. That would mean the number decreases with increasing plx as 1/p^4.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the number of stars per unit plx as a function of plx. So for a given plx p, the number of stars in the range p to p+dp is N = n * 4π * d^2 * dd, where dd is the change in distance.

But d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp )

But again, the negative just indicates direction, so the magnitude is:

N = n *4π * (1/p^4 ) dp.

So the number per unit plx (dp) is (4π n)/p^4.

So as p increases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but what does this mean? The number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to p^4, so the higher the plx (closer the star), the more stars you'd expect per unit plx.

Wait, but in reality, we know that stars are more densely packed at closer distances because the density in space is uniform — but wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh wait, no—the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So perhaps the apparent distribution is uniform, but that's a different thing.

Wait, the initial assumption is stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Uniformly in the sky could mean that their angular distribution is uniform, but that's not the same as a uniform spatial distribution. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says, "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." So maybe they mean that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform, not their actual spatial distribution.

So in that case, the number per unit area on the sky would be uniform. But when considering parallax, which relates to distance, the number of stars at a certain distance would depend on how the solid angle relates to distance.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach.

If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky in terms of their apparent positions, then the number per unit area (like per steradian) is the same everywhere. But when you consider parallax, which relates to distance, the number of stars at a certain distance would vary based on how the solid angle changes with distance.

The solid angle for a thin shell at distance d is dΩ = 2π (1 - cosθ) ≈ 2π (1 - (1 - θ²/2)) ) for small angles, which gives dΩ ≈ π θ², but θ is related to the parallax. Parallax p is equal to θ (in radians) when θ is small. So p ≈ θ.

So the solid angle for a thin ring at parallax p is dΩ proportional to p² Δp.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The solid angle element in spherical coordinates is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ. For a thin ring at a particular θ, the solid angle is 2π sinθ dθ. But for a given parallax p, which is θ, so θ = p.

So the solid angle for a ring at parallax p with thickness Δp is dΩ = 2π sin(p) Δp. Since for small p, sin(p) ≈ p, so dΩ ≈ 2π p Δp.

But stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, so the number of stars in a solid angle dΩ is n * dΩ, where n is the surface density (number per unit solid angle).

So N = n * 2π p Δp.

But wait, this gives the number of stars in a range of parallax Δp around p. So the number per unit Δp is N / Δp ≈ 2π n p.

So this suggests that the number increases linearly with p, which would be 1/plx^1. But wait, this contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm. Which approach is correct?

Wait, let me think. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, so how does this number change with plx. The first approach considered stars uniformly distributed in space, and found that the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. The second approach, assuming stars are uniformly distributed on the sky (so their surface density is uniform), gives a number per unit plx proportional to p.

But the question says, "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." So I think the second approach is correct, because it's about their apparent distribution on the sky, not their actual spatial distribution.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." So perhaps that refers to their apparent positions, not their actual spatial distribution. So in that case, the number per unit area (per steradian) is the same everywhere. But when considering a range of distances, the number of stars per unit parallax would depend on how the solid angle changes with distance.

Wait, but for a given parallax p, the number of stars in that shell would be n * dΩ * (thickness in distance). But wait, no, that's not right. If the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, then the surface density (n) is the same everywhere, regardless of distance.

But each star's apparent position depends on its actual position (distance). So two stars at the same distance would have uniform distribution on the sky, but stars at different distances would have different apparent distributions.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d. The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² * (thickness in distance Δd). Here, n is the number density of stars in space (stars per cubic parsec).

But the parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So Δd = - (1/p²) Δp (since when p increases, d decreases). So the number of stars in a shell is N = n * 4π (1/p²) Δd = n * 4π (1/p²) (-1/p² Δp) ) = -4πn/(p^4) Δp.

So the number of stars per unit Δp is 4πn/(p^4) which is proportional to 1/p^4. So the first approach (uniform in space) gives a 1/p^4 dependence.

But the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which may imply that their distribution is uniform on the celestial sphere, not in space. So perhaps the surface density is uniform, which would imply that the number of stars per unit solid angle is the same everywhere.

So for a given parallax p, the solid angle element is dΩ = 2π (1 - cosθ) ≈ 2π (1 - (1 - θ²/2)) ) ≈ π θ². But θ is about p, so dΩ ≈ π p².

Wait, but that's for a small angle. So the number of stars in the range of parallax from p to p+Δp is N = n_sky * dΩ * Δp? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, if the surface density is n (number per steradian), then the number of stars in a solid angle dΩ is N = n * dΩ.

But dΩ for a thin shell (ring) at parallax p is, as I said before, approximately 2π sin(p) Δp. For small p, sin(p) ≈ p, so dΩ ≈ 2π p Δp.

So the number of stars in a thin ring around parallax p is N ≈ n * 2π p Δp.

Thus, the number per unit Δp is N/(Δp) ≈ 2π n p.

Which suggests that the number increases linearly with p, so 1/p^(-1), which is option C) ~1/plx^1.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions based on the two assumptions: uniform in space (leading to 1/p^4) and uniform in the sky (leading to p).

The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

Question: In this scenario, how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?

Options: ... So when the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I think it refers to their apparent positions, not their actual spatial distribution. So the second approach applies, leading to a 1/p^(-1) dependence, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The actual number of stars observed at a given parallax depends on both the number of stars at that distance and their apparent density on the sky. So if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell, which is 4π d², multiplied by the number of stars per unit volume in space.

Wait, but if the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, perhaps the number per unit distance is considered. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the flux of stars per unit parallax.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it again.

Two scenarios:

1. Uniform spatial distribution (number density n is constant). Then, the number of stars between distance d and d + Δd is N = n * 4π d² Δd. Since d = 1/plx, Δd = -Δplx/(plx^2). So, N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (Δplx/(plx^2)) ) → N = n *4π Δplx / plx^4. So the number per Δplx is N/Δplx = 4πn/(plx^4). So it's 1/plx^4.

2. Uniform distribution on the sky (surface density is uniform). Then, the number of stars in a ring (determined by plx) would be proportional to the solid angle at that plx. The solid angle for a thin ring at plx is about 2π plx Δplx.

So N = n_sky * 2π plx Δplx. So N per Δplx is n_sky * 2π plx. So number increases with plx.

But the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So which scenario applies?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, it means that the surface density (number per steradian) is the same everywhere. So the number of stars per unit solid angle is a constant.

So for a given parallax p, the number of stars in that thin shell would be n * dΩ, where dΩ is the solid angle. But dΩ for a ring at p is 2π sin(p) Δp, and since p is small, sin(p) ≈ p. So dΩ ≈ 2π p Δp.

Thus, N = n * 2π p Δp.

So per unit Δp, the number is N/Δp = 2π n p.

Which is proportional to p, meaning the number of stars per unit plx increases with p.

So that would be option C: ~1/plx^1, but wait, no. Because if it's proportional to p (which is 1/plx), perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, in the second scenario, N per Δp is proportional to p. So as p increases (i.e., as the parallax increases, meaning closer stars), the number of stars per unit plx also increases. So the number per unit plx is proportional to p, which is 1/(distance). So in terms of plx, the number per unit plx is proportional to plx.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx (N per Δp) is proportional to p. So the number increases with p, which is 1/plx^1. So the answer would be option C: ~1/plx^1.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's say p is 1 arcsec. Then the number per unit p is proportional to 1. If p doubles to 2, then the number per unit p is proportional to 2. So as p increases, the number per unit p increases. So the number per unit p is proportional to p, which is option C.

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. I thought that closer stars would be more numerous in a given range of plx. Wait, the number per unit plx (like per 1 arcsec) increases as plx increases. So as you move to larger plx (which are closer stars), you have more stars in each unit plx step.

Alternatively, if you look at a small range of plx, say from 1 to 2, you'd have more stars than in a range from 10 to 11. Because as p increases, the number per unit p increases. So it makes sense that closer stars (higher p) have more stars per unit p.

But wait, let me think about the spatial distribution again. If stars are uniformly distributed in space (n is constant), then the number per unit plx is ~1/p^4, which would mean that higher p (closer stars) have much higher numbers per unit p. But if stars are uniformly distributed on the sky, then the number per unit plx is ~p, which increases linearly.

But the question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So I think the correct approach is the second one, leading to the number per unit plx being proportional to p, which is option C, 1/plx^1.

Wait, no, because p is the parallax; higher p corresponds to closer stars. So if the number per unit plx is proportional to p, then it's ~p, which is same as 1/(distance)^2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.

If the surface density is uniform, meaning that the number of stars per unit solid angle is the same everywhere (n_sky), then the number of stars in a thin ring (determined by parallax) depends on the solid angle of that ring.

The solid angle for a ring at parallax p is approximately 2π p Δp (since for small p, sin p ~ p).

So N = n_sky * 2π p Δp.

Thus, the number per unit Δp is N/Δp = 2π n_sky p.

Which is proportional to p (parallax), so the number increases with parallax.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to plx, which is 1/(distance)^2.

But the question is about how the number changes with plx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx increases.

So looking at the options, option C is ~1/plx^1, which is proportional to plx.

Yes, that would make option C correct.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the scenario where stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. The key is to relate the number of stars to the solid angle and parallax.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Parallax and Distance Relation**:  
   Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). As \( p \) increases (closer stars), \( d \) decreases.

2. **Uniform Distribution in the Sky**:  
   If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, the number of stars per unit solid angle is constant. The solid angle for a thin ring at parallax \( p \) is approximately \( d\Omega \approx 2\pi p \, dp \) for small \( p \).

3. **Number of Stars in a Parallax Range**:  
   The number of stars in a thin ring at parallax \( p \) with thickness \( dp \) is proportional to the solid angle \( d\Omega \). Thus, the number of stars is:  
   \[
   N \propto n_{\text{sky}} \cdot d\Omega \propto n_{\text{sky}} \cdot 2\pi p \, dp
   \]  
   where \( n_{\text{sky}} \) is the surface density of stars (number per unit solid angle).

4. **Number per Unit Parallax Range**:  
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)) is:  
   \[
   \frac{N}{dp} \propto 2\pi n_{\text{sky}} \cdot p
   \]  
   This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax increases linearly with \( p \).

5. **Interpretation**:  
   As \( p \) (parallax) increases, the number of stars per unit parallax range also increases. This is consistent with the fact that closer stars (higher \( p \)) are more densely distributed in the sky.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\( \sim 1/p^4 \))**: This would apply if stars were uniformly distributed in space, not on the sky.  
- **Option B (\( \sim 1/p^2 \))**: Incorrect, as the dependence is linear, not quadratic.  
- **Option C (\( \sim 1/p^1 \))**: Correct, as the number of stars per unit parallax increases linearly with \( p \).  
- **Option D (\( \sim 1/p^3 \))**: Incorrect, as this does not match the derived dependence.

### Conclusion:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( p \), which corresponds to \( \sim 1/p^1 \).
