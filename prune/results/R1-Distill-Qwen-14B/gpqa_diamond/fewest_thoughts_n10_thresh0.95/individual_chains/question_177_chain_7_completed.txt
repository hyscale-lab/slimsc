--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming both radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, so I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both are black bodies, we can use this formula.

Wait, but they also mention radial velocities. I think radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! The Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light's wavelength changes. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again.

Actually, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), but if it's moving away, it's λ = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). But wait, this is a non-relativistic approximation. Since the velocities given are 700 km/s, which is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), the approximation should be okay.

But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That means the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, and Star_1 is at rest. So the observed wavelength of their maximum emissions is the same.

The maximum emission for a black body is at wavelength λ_max, which is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So for each star, λ_max is inversely proportional to their temperatures.

But wait, the observed λ_max (observed by us) for each star depends on their actual λ_max and their radial velocity. So for Star_1, since it's at rest, observed λ1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, moving with velocity v = 700 km/s away from us (since radial velocity is positive for moving away). So its observed wavelength would be λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c). Because when a source moves away, the observed wavelength increases.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Wait, no. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ1 (observed) = λ2 (observed). Because that's when they appear brightest.

So λ1_obs = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1/c) [but v1 is 0, so λ1_obs = λ_rest1].

λ2_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) [since v2 is 700 km/s away, positive velocity].

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So, b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Canceling b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, let me rearrange that. Let me take reciprocal on both sides:

T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + (v2/c)) ] 

So T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + (700e3)/(3e5)) ]

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? No, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, which is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s.

So (v2/c) = (7e5)/(3e8) = 7/(3e3) ) → approximately 0.002333...

So 1 + (v2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 * (1 / 1.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is approximately 0.99767 times T2.

But wait, that's a very small difference. Is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let me double-check. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, that's when the source is moving away. So if the source is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer. So the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for v << c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/(2c)).

Wait, wait, another approach: the non-relativistic Doppler effect for light is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c). But I'm a bit confused between the relativistic and non-relativistic approximations.

Let me clarify. The exact Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) }. So for small v/c, we can expand this:

sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 + x, where x = v/c.

So sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) = (1 + x/2) ) / sqrt(1 - x^2) )? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, using a Taylor expansion for small x:

sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) = sqrt( (1 + x)(1 + x) ) / (1 - x^2) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, for small x, (1+x)/(1-x) ≈ (1+x)(1 + x) ) = 1 + 2x + x². So sqrt(1+2x) ≈ 1 + x.

So the square root of (1+2x) is approximately 1 + x when x is small.

So λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + x/2), where x = v/c.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift formula for small velocities is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/(c)).

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the exact formula first.

We have:

λ1_obs = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1_obs/c) 

Wait, no. The Doppler shift formula is tricky. The source emits at λ_rest. If the source is moving away at speed v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ).

So for Star_2, which is moving away at v2=700 km/s, its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

And for Star_1, since v1=0, λ1_obs = λ_rest1.

But according to the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b/T.

So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

Canceling b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Taking reciprocal:

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which can be rewritten as:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Now, v2 is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700e3 m/s / (3e8 m/s) ) → 700e3 / 3e8 = 7/(300) → 0.002333...

So computing the ratio inside the sqrt:

(1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) = (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333)

Calculating that:

0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99537

So sqrt(0.99537) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 is about 0.99768 times T2.

So, T1 ≈ 0.99768 T2.

Wait, that's a very small difference. So the temperature of Star_1 is slightly lower than Star_2.

But wait, mass and radius are given as 1.5 times. How does that relate to temperature?

Hmm, perhaps we need to find the relationship between mass and temperature for these stars. But wait, the problem states that the luminosity is to be calculated as per black body radiation. So perhaps the mass isn't directly relevant for the calculation of luminosity, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity depends only on R and T. Because L =4π R² σ T^4.

So we're given R1 = 1.5 R2, and the temperatures are T1 and T2.

We can compute L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

We have T1 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99768.

So T1/T2 = 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Calculating that: 0.99768^4 ≈ Let me compute step by step.

0.99768^2 = approximately (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99536 - 0.00000538 ≈ 0.9953546.

Then 0.99768^4 = (0.99768^2)^2 ≈ (0.99535)^2 ≈ about 0.9907.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ approximately 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, but wait, 2.25 * 0.9907 is 2.25 * 0.9907. Let me compute exactly.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

Plus 2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, option C is ~2.35, etc.

Wait, but I approximated earlier steps. Let me perhaps compute more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate the (T1/T2) ratio.

We had v2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

So v2/c = 700 / 300000 = 7/(3000) = 0.002333333...

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) = (1 - 0.0023333)/(1 + 0.0023333) = 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Compute this division.

Let me compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

≈ (1 - 0.002333333) / (1 + 0.002333333) = [ (1 - a) / (1 + a) ] where a=0.002333333.

We can use the approximation (1 - a)/(1 + a) ≈ (1 - 2a) for small a.

So, (1 - 2a) where a=0.002333333 → 1 - 0.004666666 ≈ 0.995333334.

But the exact value is slightly different. Alternatively, compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Let me divide 0.997666667 by 1.002333333.

Let me compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Approximate calculation:

The numerator is 0.997666667 and denominator 1.002333333.

Let me write this as (1 - 0.002333333) / (1 + 0.002333333).

We can write this as:

(1 - a)/(1 + a) = (1 - a)(1 + a)^-1.

Using the expansion (1 + a)^-1 ≈ 1 - a + a² - a³ + ..., for small a.

So (1 - a)(1 - a + a²) ≈ (1 - a)(1 - a) + (1 -a)(a²) ), but perhaps an approximate way.

Alternatively, compute this as:

Let x = a = 0.002333333.

(1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ (1 -x) * (1 -x + x^2 - x^3 + ...) ) ≈ (1 - x) * (1 - x) (since higher terms are negligible).

So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

So 1 - 2*(0.002333333) + (0.002333333)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.004666666 + 0.000005444 → 0.995338778.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

1 - x = 0.997666667.

1 + x = 1.002333333.

Dividing these:

0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

We can write it as (approx):

Let me compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

≈ (approx) 0.99537.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

But perhaps it's better to compute it accurately.

Wait, let me compute 0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Let me consider that 1.002333333 ≈ 1 + 0.002333333.

So, 0.997666667 ÷ (1 + 0.002333333) ≈ 0.997666667 * (1 - 0.002333333) ≈ 0.997666667 * 0.997666667.

Which is (0.997666667)^2.

Wait, that's not exactly correct because 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x, so 0.997666667 * (1 - 0.002333333).

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's easier to just compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the more precise calculation.

So, (1 - x)/(1 + x) = [ (1 - x) ] / [ (1 + x) ].

Let me compute (1 - x) = 0.997666667.

(1 + x) = 1.002333333.

Dividing 0.997666667 by 1.002333333.

Let me write this as 0.997666667 * (1 / 1.002333333).

1 / 1.002333333 is approximately 0.997666667.

Wait, that's because 1.002333333 is approximately 1 + 0.002333333.

So 1 / (1 + a) ≈ 1 - a + a² - a³ + ..., so up to a²:

a = 0.002333333.

So 1/(1+a) ≈ 1 - a + a².

a² ≈ (0.002333333)^2 ≈ 5.444e-6.

So 1/(1.002333333) ≈ 1 - 0.002333333 + 5.444e-6.

Which is approximately 0.99766667 + 0.000005444 → 0.997672114.

So, 0.997666667 * 0.997672114 ≈ Let me compute that.

Multiply 0.997666667 * 0.997672114.

Well, approximately, 0.997666667 * 0.997672114 ≈ (1 - 0.002333333) * (1 - 0.00232789) ≈ 1 - 0.002333333 - 0.00232789 + (0.002333333 * 0.00232789) )

But the cross terms are negligible.

So approximately, 1 - (0.002333333 + 0.00232789) ) ≈ 1 - 0.004661223 → 0.995338777.

So the ratio (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 0.995338777.

Thus, T1 = T2 * sqrt(0.995338777 )

Compute sqrt(0.995338777).

Since sqrt(0.995338777) is the square root. Let me approximate:

0.995338777 is about 0.99534.

What's the square root of 0.99534?

I know that sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.994987, sqrt(0.995) = approx 0.997499.

Let me compute 0.99767^2 = (0.99767)^2 = 0.99535.

Wait, exactly:

0.99767 * 0.99767.

= (1 - 0.00233) * (1 - 0.00233)

= 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2.

= 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289.

Which is 0.9953454289.

So sqrt(0.995338777) ≈ 0.99767.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 = 0.99767 T2.

So (T1/T2) = 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute that.

0.99767^2 = approx 0.99534.

Then, 0.99534^2 → approx 0.9907.

Wait, let's compute 0.99534 * 0.99534.

= (1 - 0.00466) * (1 - 0.00466)

= 1 - 2*0.00466 + (0.00466)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932 + 0.0000217156.

Which is 0.9906817156.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99068.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

Plus 2.25 * 0.00068 = 0.00153.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.00153 = 2.22903.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I may have made a mistake in the Doppler shift approach. Let me re-express the problem.

We have:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since Star_1 is at rest).

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) ) }.

But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b/T.

So,

b/T1 = λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which implies,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Which is the same as before.

So, all the steps are correct.

So, with T1 ≈ 0.99767 T2.

Now, let me compute (T1/T2)^4 more accurately.

0.99767^4.

Let me compute 0.99767^2:

(0.99767)^2 = 0.99767 * 0.99767.

Let me compute:

0.99767 * 0.99767:

Multiply 99767 * 99767, but it's easier to compute 99767^2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute as (1 - 0.00233)^2.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a = 0.00233.

So 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 → 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 → 0.9953454289.

So (0.99767)^2 = approx 0.995345.

Then, (0.995345)^2 = ?

Compute 0.995345 * 0.995345.

Let me compute this:

0.995345 * 0.995345.

= (1 - 0.004655)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2.

= 1 - 0.00931 + 0.00002167.

= 0.99069167.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 0.99069167.

Multiply by R^2 ratio (2.25):

2.25 * 0.99069167 = ?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00069167 ≈ 0.001557.

So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.001557 ≈ 2.229057.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So the closest option is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Given Information
- \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\)
- The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\).
- Star_1 is stationary (\(v_1 = 0\)), while Star_2 has a radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\).

### Step 2: Relating Observed Wavelengths to Temperature
The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star_2, moving away at \(v_2\), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

For Star_1, which is stationary, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant, we substitute:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute Temperature Ratio
Given \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} = 0.002333
\]

Substitute into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \sqrt{0.99537} \approx 0.99767
\]

Thus, \(T_1 \approx 0.99767 T_2\).

### Step 4: Compute Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substitute \(R_1/R_2 = 1.5\) and \(T_1/T_2 = 0.99767\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2\):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Next, calculate \((0.99767)^4\). Using approximations:

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad (0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Finally, multiply:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Match to Closest Option
The computed luminosity ratio is approximately \(2.229\), which matches option **D) ~2.23**.
