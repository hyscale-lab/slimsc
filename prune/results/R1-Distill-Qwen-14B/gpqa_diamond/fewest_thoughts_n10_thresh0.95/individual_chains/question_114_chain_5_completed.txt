Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what's going on.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents A and B from the options given. 

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually via some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, right? So the ketone is reacting with CN-.

Wait, but I think there's a specific reaction where ketones react with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh right, this must be the Stephen reduction, but wait, no. Wait, wait, the Stephen reduction is for aldehydes. Or maybe it's the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes too. Or perhaps it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, that's it! The cyanohydrin formation.

So ketones can react with HCN (or sources of CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form cyanohydrins. The cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So in this case, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and an acid (like H3O+ as a proton source) would form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So I think reagent A is H3O+ because the reaction requires an acid catalyst for the protonation steps.

So that would point towards option A or B or C or D, looking at the options. The first part of the options for A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid as well, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the catalyst here. But I remember that the cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN and an acid, which could be H2SO4 or H3O+.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+. So that would eliminate options C and D because they have A as NaHSO3.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. The common reagents for oxidizing nitriles are strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, another method involves treating the nitrile with HCl (like HCl in aqueous conditions), but wait, that would typically convert it to an amine or something else under different conditions. Or maybe using H2O and some acid catalyst?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, hydrolysis of nitriles (RCN) yields carboxylic acids (RCOOH). For that, you would use H3O+ (acid) and heat. So the reagent B in this case would be H2O with an acid catalyst, perhaps HCl or H3O+.

Wait, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the reagent B is probably an acid catalyst, like HCl in water. Alternatively, maybe it's a strong acid like H2SO4. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option B has B as CH3COOH.

Wait, but for hydrolysis of nitriles, the typical conditions are either H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or NaOH (basic conditions, which gives a carboxylate). Since the product is the carboxylic acid and not the salt, the hydrolysis must be done under acidic conditions. So B should be an acid. So B would be HCl in H2O.

Looking back at the options, option A has B as HCl. So let's see: option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That would fit both reactions.

Alternatively, let me confirm. For the first reaction, butanone + NaCN + H3O+ (A) → cyanohydrin. Yes, that's correct. For the second reaction, the nitrile (from the cyanohydrin) is hydrolyzed in H2O with HCl (reagent B is HCl) to form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When you hydrolyze the nitrile, you need to protonate it, and HCl in water would provide the acidic conditions needed. So reagent B is HCl.

So putting it all together, for the first reaction, A is H3O+ and for the second reaction, B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A is (A = H3O+, B = HCl), which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So option A is correct for both parts.

Wait, but could there be an alternative for reagent B? What if B is CH3COOH, an acid, but weaker than HCl. Would that work? For hydrolysis of nitriles, strong acid is generally used. So I think HCl is more likely.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Reagents:** Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where a ketone reacts with CN⁻ in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid catalyst is typically H₃O⁺, as it facilitates the protonation steps necessary for the reaction. Therefore, reagent A is H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2:
**Reagents:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles under acidic conditions typically requires a strong acid, such as HCl, to provide the necessary acidic environment. Thus, reagent B is HCl.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for A, CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and less suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles.
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the cyanohydrin formation reaction.
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as these reagents are suitable for both reactions.

Answer: A
