--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and the speed it's moving at. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and beta is the velocity in terms of the speed of light.

But how do I get gamma and beta? Oh, right, from the energy. Since the particle is produced with energy E, its gamma is E divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m_X. Let me compute that.

E is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), but wait, that's another way. Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and the rest energy is m c², so yeah, gamma is E/(m c²). But since the units are in GeV and m_X is in GeV/c², I think the beta can be found from beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X c² / E)^2 ) * c. Wait, maybe I should just calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, gamma = 6.6667, so gamma squared is about 44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887c.

But wait, maybe a more precise calculation is needed. Because the answer choices are precise, so maybe I shouldn't approximate. Let me think: gamma is 8 / 1.2 exactly. 8 divided by 1.2 is (80/12) = (20/3) ≈ 6.6666667.

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444.

So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is... let me compute that. Let's see, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775. Let me check: 0.9887 * 0.9887 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2. 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 is about 0.0172. 0.0087^2 is negligible. So 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776. That's close to 0.9775, so beta is approximately 0.9887c.

Now, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ. I remember that the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/tau, so tau is ħ / Γ. Wait, but sometimes it's Γ = ħ/tau, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The mean lifetime (proper time, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau = hbar / Gamma, where Gamma is the total decay width. Because the width Γ is the inverse of the lifetime, but in natural units where ħ = 1, the relation is Γ = 1/tau.

So tau = hbar / Gamma. But since Gamma is given in MeV, I need to convert units properly.

Wait, let me think about the units. Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Hbar c has units of GeV fm, I think. Because hbar is about 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, hbar c ≈ 197.328 MeV fm. So, in units where c=1, hbar c is 197.328 MeV fm.

So Gamma is 320 MeV, so tau = hbar c / (Gamma c^2) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, Gamma is the width, which is in energy units (MeV). The relation is tau = hbar / (Gamma). Because Gamma has units of energy, and hbar has units of energy * time (since E=ħν, so ħ has units of J·s, or eV·s). So, tau = hbar / Gamma.

But to compute tau, I need to convert the units correctly. Let's see:

hbar = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s.

Calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait another thing: is Gamma the total decay width? Yes, because the question says the width is Gamma_X = 320 MeV. So that's correct.

So tau is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

But then, the mean decay distance is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, let me make sure. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity in terms of c. So gamma * beta * c is the velocity in terms of c times gamma, which is the same as (gamma beta) c. So L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, no, because tau is the proper time. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean decay distance is (gamma tau) * c beta.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and the speed is beta c. So distance is speed * time: beta c * gamma tau.

Yes, that makes sense.

So putting it all together:

L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

But since beta is in terms of c, and c is in m/s, let me plug in the numbers.

c = 3e8 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

Beta is approximately 0.9887.

Tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta. Gamma is 20/3, beta is 0.9887.

20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

So 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute that: 6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322, 0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6589. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.6589 = 6.5911.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5911.

Then multiply by c: 3e8 m/s.

3e8 * 6.5911 ≈ 1.9773e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau (2.057e-24 s).

So 1.9773e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 1.9773e9 * 2.057e-24 m.

Multiply the coefficients: 1.9773 * 2.057 ≈ 4.065.

And the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So L ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the beta calculation, perhaps I made an approximation that's too rough.

Because when I calculated sqrt(0.9775), I approximated it as 0.9887, which is correct but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta using more precise methods.

Let me compute beta more accurately. So, 1 - 1/gamma^2 is 1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) = 1 - (9/400) = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me write it as 0.9775 = 0.9887^2 as before, but perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = approx 0.9775, which we know from before. So beta is 0.9887.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps the calculation is better done with exact numbers.

Gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666666666667.

So 1/gamma^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = exactly sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

What's sqrt(391)? Let's compute that.

I think 19^2 is 361, 20^2 is 400, so sqrt(391) is approximately 19.774.

Let me see: 19.774^2 = (20 - 0.226)^2 = 400 - 2*20*0.226 + (0.226)^2 ≈ 400 - 8.992 + 0.051 ≈ 391.059. Hmm, but 19.774^2 is about 391.059, which is a bit higher than 391. So perhaps sqrt(391) is approximately 19.7745.

Wait, 19.7745^2 = ?

Well, 19.77^2 = (19 + 0.77)^2 = 361 + 2*19*0.77 + 0.77^2.

Let me compute that: 2*19*0.77=38 *0.77= 29.26. 0.77^2=0.5929.

So 361 + 29.26=390.26, + 0.5929=390.8529. Hmm, but 19.77^2 is 390.8529, which is less than 391. So 19.77^2=390.8529, and 391 is 0.1471 higher. Let me see, next decimal.

We can use linear approximation. Let x = 19.77. x²=390.8529. We need to find delta such that (x + delta)^2 = 391. So:

x² + 2x delta + delta² = 391 → 390.8529 + 2*19.77 * delta ≈ 391 → 2*19.77*delta ≈ 0.1471.

So delta ≈ 0.1471 / (2 * 19.77) ≈ 0.1471 / 39.54 ≈ 0.00372.

So x + delta ≈ 19.77 + 0.00372 = 19.77372.

So sqrt(391) ≈ 19.77372.

So beta = sqrt(391)/20 = 19.77372 / 20 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * (19.77372/20) = (19.77372) / 3 ≈ 6.59124.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, gamma is 20/3, which is about 6.6667. Beta is 19.77372/20, which is 0.988686.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * (19.77372/20) )= (19.77372) /3 ≈ 6.59124.

So gamma * beta ≈6.59124.

So now, c is 3e8 m/s.

So, gamma*beta*c = 6.59124 * 3e8 m/s = 1.977372e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau, which is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So L = 1.977372e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply the coefficients: 1.977372 * 2.057 ≈ let's compute that.

1.977372 * 2 = 3.954744.

1.977372 * 0.057 ≈ approx 0.1130.

So total is 3.954744 + 0.1130 ≈ 4.0677.

So 4.0677e-15 m.

Wait, but my earlier approximate calculation gave me 4.065e-15 m. So the precise calculation gives about 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, but wait. Is this the correct approach? Let me think about another approach.

Alternative approach: The mean decay length is also given by L = (gamma * m_p) * ctau, but I think that's a different formula. No, wait, ctau is c multiplied by tau, the proper lifetime.

Wait, ctau is the mean decay length in the rest frame. So the actual decay length is gamma times ctau times beta?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Which is what I did earlier. So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another way to compute tau: since Gamma = ħ/tau, so tau = ħ/(Gamma). But I have to make sure about the units.

Wait, let me recheck the units:

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So with that, the calculation for L = gamma*beta*c*tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, and tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

gamma * beta = 6.59124,

c = 3e8 m/s,

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

gamma * beta * c = 6.59124 * 3e8 = 1.977372e9 m/s.

Then, multiply by tau: 1.977372e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

So, the exponent is 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

The coefficient is 1.977372 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute that.

1.977372 * 2 = 3.954744.

1.977372 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1118.

So total coefficient is about 3.954744 + 0.1118 = 4.066544.

So L ≈ 4.066544e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake when calculating the product 1.977372e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Alternatively, perhaps the more precise calculation is better.

1.977372e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977372 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977372 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 1.977372 * 2 = 3.954744.

1.977372 *0.056875.

0.056875 = 56875/1e6. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.977372 * 0.05 =0.0988686, 1.977372 * 0.006875=approx 0.013568.

Adding them: 0.0988686 + 0.013568 ≈ 0.1124366.

So total is 3.954744 + 0.1124366 = 4.0671806.

So 4.06718e-15 m.

Wait, but the option B is 4.0655e-15. So perhaps I should compute this with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Earlier, I calculated gamma * beta as 6.59124.

Wait, gamma is 20/3 = 6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(0.9775) = 0.98868638.

So 6.666666666666667 * 0.98868638 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

6.666666666666667 * 0.98868638.

Breaking it down:

6 * 0.98868638 = 5.93211828.

0.666666666666667 * 0.98868638 ≈ 0.65912425.

Adding them: 5.93211828 + 0.65912425 = 6.59124253.

So gamma * beta = 6.59124253.

So that's more precise.

Then, c = 3e8 m/s.

So gamma*beta*c = 6.59124253 * 3e8 = 1.97737276e9 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply them:

1.97737276e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97737276 * 2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.97737276 *2.056875.

Let me compute that:

1.97737276 * 2 = 3.95474552.

1.97737276 *0.056875.

Compute 0.05 *1.97737276 = 0.098868638.

0.006875 *1.97737276 = (0.006 *1.97737276) + (0.000875 *1.97737276).

0.006 *1.97737276 = 0.01186423656.

0.000875 *1.97737276 ≈ 0.00173307.

Adding them: 0.01186423656 + 0.00173307=0.01359730656.

So 0.056875 *1.97737276 ≈ 0.098868638 + 0.01359730656 ≈ 0.112465944.

So total is 3.95474552 + 0.112465944 = 4.067211464.

So 4.067211464e-15 meters.

Hmm, but the options are B) 4.0655e-15 and C)5.0223e-15.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tau calculation.

Wait, tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875 → tau =20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of the product 6.59124253 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

gamma is 20/3, beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(4E^2)).

Wait, another approach: maybe using the relation between the decay length and the particle's properties.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 4.067e-15 meters. The closest option is B) 4.0655e-15. So perhaps I made a slight approximation in beta.

Wait, maybe I should compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Wait, sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute it using more accurate steps.

Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me start with x0=0.9887.

x1 = 0.5*(x0 + 0.9775/x0).

Compute x0=0.9887.

x0^2 = 0.977501 (approx 0.977501).

So 0.9775/x0= 0.9775/0.9887 ≈ 0.988686.

So x1 = 0.5*(0.9887 + 0.988686 )= 0.5*(1.977386)=0.988693.

Compute x1^2: 0.988693^2 = ?

0.988693 *0.988693: let me compute that.

Compute 0.988693^2:

= (0.98 + 0.008693)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008693 + 0.008693^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008693 = 1.96 * 0.008693 ≈ 0.017037.

0.008693^2 ≈ 0.0000755.

So total: 0.9604 +0.017037=0.977437, plus 0.0000755 gives 0.9775125.

But 0.9775125 is a bit higher than 0.9775, so the square is about 0.9775125, which is 0.0000125 over.

So to get x1^2 to be 0.9775, need to adjust x.

Compute the correction:

Let f(x) = x^2 -0.9775.

f(x1)= (0.988693)^2 -0.9775 = 0.9775125 -0.9775 = 0.0000125.

We can compute the next iteration.

x2 = x1 - f(x1)/(2x1).

f(x1) = 0.0000125.

2x1 = 2 *0.988693 ≈1.977386.

So correction is 0.0000125 / 1.977386 ≈ 6.32e-6.

So x2 = 0.988693 -6.32e-6 ≈0.9886867.

Compute x2^2:

0.9886867^2.

Again, using (0.98 +0.0086867)^2=0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.0086867 + 0.0086867^2.

0.98 * 2 =1.96. 1.96 *0.0086867≈0.017016.

0.0086867^2≈0.00007546.

So total: 0.9604 +0.017016=0.977416 +0.00007546=0.9774915.

Still a bit higher than 0.9775. So f(x2)=0.9774915-0.9775= -0.0000085.

Wait, no, 0.9774915 is less than 0.9775, so f(x2) is negative.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, x2 is 0.9886867, so x2^2 is:

0.9886867 *0.9886867.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Another approach: 0.9886867 * 0.9886867.

Let me compute 0.9886867 * 0.9886867:

Break it into (0.988 + 0.0006867)^2.

= 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0006867 + (0.0006867)^2.

0.988^2 = (1 -0.012)^2=1 -0.024 +0.000144= 0.976144.

2*0.988 *0.0006867 = 1.976 *0.0006867 ≈ 0.001354.

(0.0006867)^2≈4.715e-7.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.001354=0.977498 + 0.0000004715≈0.9774985.

Which is 0.9774985, which is 0.9775 -0.0000015.

So x2^2=0.9774985, which is just under 0.9775. So f(x2)=0.9774985 -0.9775= -1.5e-6.

So, to compute x3, we need to adjust x2.

x3 = x2 - (f(x2))/(2x2).

f(x2)= -1.5e-6.

2x2=2*(0.9886867)=1.9773734.

So delta = ( -1.5e-6 ) / (1.9773734 ) ≈ -7.586e-7.

x3 = x2 + delta → 0.9886867 + (-7.586e-7 )=0.988685944.

So x3=0.988685944.

Compute x3^2:

0.988685944^2.

Again, using the same approach.

0.988685944 = 0.988 + 0.000685944.

(0.988)^2 = 0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.000685944 = 1.976 *0.000685944 ≈ 0.00135155.

(0.000685944)^2 ≈ 4.705e-7.

So sum: 0.976144 +0.00135155=0.97749555 +4.705e-7 ≈0.977496025.

Which is 0.977496025, which is still slightly less than 0.9775.

So f(x3)=0.977496025 -0.9775= -0.000003975.

Wait, no, 0.9775 is 0.977500000, so it's 0.977500000 - 0.977496025 = 0.000003975.

So f(x3)=0.000003975.

So next iteration:

x4 = x3 - (f(x3))/(2x3).

f(x3)=3.975e-6.

2x3=2 *0.988685944=1.977371888.

delta = 3.975e-6 / 1.977371888 ≈ 2.01e-6.

x4 = x3 - (delta) → 0.988685944 - 0.00000201 = 0.988683934.

But wait, f(x3)=3.975e-6, which is positive, so x3^2 is less than 0.9775, so we need to increase x to reach higher x^2.

Wait, no, f(x) =x^2 - 0.9775. So if x3^2 is 0.977496025, which is less than 0.9775, f(x3)= -0.000003975. So the function is negative, meaning x3 is too low.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

If x^2 < target, then f(x)=x^2 - target is negative. So, to increase x would increase x^2, thus making f(x) less negative.

Wait, Newton-Raphson uses f(x) and f'(x) to find the root. The function here is f(x)=x^2 - 0.9775, and we're seeking x where f(x)=0.

So, x3 is where x3^2 =0.977496025, which is less than 0.9775. So f(x3) is negative (0.977496 -0.9775= -0.000004).

So, we need to increase x to make x^2 larger.

So, in the correction step, the correction is delta = f(x3)/(2x3) → (-0.000004)/(2*0.988685944 )= (-0.000004)/1.977371888≈-2.027e-6.

So x4= x3 - delta → 0.988685944 - (-2.027e-6 )=0.988685944 + 2.027e-6≈0.988687971.

Wait, but that can't be right because x3 was 0.988685944, and x4 is higher, leading to a higher x^2.

Compute x4^2:

0.988687971^2.

Again, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator for more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I've spent enough time on this, and the approximation is acceptable.

But in any case, the precise beta is approximately 0.988686, leading to gamma*beta≈6.59124253.

Thus, the earlier calculation leading to L≈4.067e-15 m seems consistent.

Looking back, the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So the closest is option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but my calculation gives 4.067e-15, which is a bit higher than option B. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would give a value closer to 4.065e-15.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the product.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.97737276e9 *2.056875e-24.

Let's compute it precisely.

1.97737276e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97737276 *2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97737276 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this step by step.

2.056875 = 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

So,

1.97737276 *2 = 3.95474552.

1.97737276 *0.05=0.098868638.

1.97737276 *0.006875 = ?

Compute 0.006875 = 0.006 + 0.000875.

So,

1.97737276 * 0.006 = 0.01186423656.

1.97737276 *0.000875= 0.001733077.

Adding these gives 0.01186423656 +0.001733077= 0.01359731356.

Now, sum all three parts:

3.95474552 + 0.098868638 =4.053614158.

4.053614158 +0.01359731356=4.06721147156.

So the product is 4.06721147156e-15 m.

But the options don't have that; option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, or perhaps some approximation is made.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay width is given as Gamma, and the mean lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. But perhaps I should use relativistic lifetime, which is gamma * tau.

Wait, no, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper time tau.

So the decay length would be speed (beta c) multiplied by the mean lifetime (gamma tau).

So L = beta c gamma tau.

Which is what I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using c tau as the decay length in the rest frame, and then multiplied by gamma beta.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, let me double-check the exponents.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma*beta=6.59124.

So, L=6.59124 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.59124: 6.170625e-16 *6.59124≈4.067e-15 m.

Yes, same result.

Hmm, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is just a bit lower. Perhaps the exact calculation would get that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation of beta is sufficient, and the answer is 4.065e-15.

But looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close to my result. So I think the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \) is the velocity in terms of the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean proper lifetime,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we compute:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.4444
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225
\]
\[
1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775
\]
\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substitute the values into \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5912
\]
\[
\gamma \beta c = 6.5912 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 1.97736 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = 1.97736 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]
\[
L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The closest option to the calculated value \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
