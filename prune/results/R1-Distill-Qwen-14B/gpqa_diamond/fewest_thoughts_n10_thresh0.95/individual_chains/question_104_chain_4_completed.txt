Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question says that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The main point is about the periodic shifts in their spectral lines detected using the RV method. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude (which I think is K) relates to the star's movement towards and away from us. So, a larger shift (like 7 milli) would correspond to a higher velocity, right?

But how does that relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period somehow. Oh wait, the formula for velocity semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like) and the stars are same mass, and the orbits are circular (e=0), maybe some terms simplify. Because the inclination i might be close to 90 degrees for both, but unless it's edge-on, the sin i would affect it. But if both are similar, maybe we can assume it's the same or that the ratio is based on the same sin i. 

Wait, the problem states that the RV method detected each planet. So the detected shifts are due to their velocities. The velocity amplitude K is proportional to the star's reflex velocity. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P )^(-1/3) * (M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since the periods are what we're comparing, and the masses are same (M_p same for both planets), and M_star same as well, and e is zero, this simplifies.

Let me think again. So, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. Because rearranging the formula, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), since K = ... (1/P)^(1/3) times other terms. So if K is higher, that would mean a smaller P, because K is inversely related to P^(1/3). Because if K increases, then 1/P^(1/3) must be larger, which would imply P is smaller. Because, for example, if P is halved, then 1/P^(1/3) is doubled.

So, since planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), it's moving more, which would imply a shorter period. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's period. So if planet #2's K is larger, its period is smaller, so the ratio would be less than 1. So the answer should be less than 1. Looking at the options, options A is about 0.36, D is 0.85, B is 1.4, C is 1.96.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me write the relationship between K and P. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P ) )^(1/3)

Wait, maybe a better approach is to set up the ratio of the two K's. Let K1 be for planet #1, K2 for planet #2.

We have K1 and K2, and same M_p and M_star for both, and e=0.

So,

K1 = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, let's think of K proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ), because when you look at the formula, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )^(1) * ( M_star1 / M_star2 )^(2/3) ) * ( sin i2 / sin i1 )

But in this problem, M_p1 = M_p2 (both Neptune masses), M_star1 = M_star2 (same as Sun), and sin i is perhaps the same if the orbits are similar. If we assume sin i is the same, then the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (1) * (1) ) because M_p and M_star are same. So:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1.

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Because if K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then cubing both sides gives (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, no. Let me redo it.

We have K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)
Where C is a constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, let me compute:

K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3)) ) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, if I take the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait: Let me think. Let me write the equation again.

K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, because K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, that can't be right. Because if K1 is less than K2, then P2/P1 would be (something less than 1)^3, meaning P2 is less than P1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 compared to P1. So if P2 is less than P1, the ratio is less than 1, meaning the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, in our problem, K1 is 5 milli, K2 is 7 milli. So K1 < K2. So K1/K2 is 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, because (5/7) is 5/7 ≈ 0.714, so cube that: 0.714^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's P2 / P1 = 0.36, which is less than 1. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1, which is about 36% of P1's period.

So the answer would be that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the ratio is approximately 0.36.

But looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when K increases, the velocity semi-amplitude is higher. This implies that the star is moving faster in its orbit, which would happen if the orbit is shorter. Because for a more massive planet, the star moves more, but in this case, the planet masses are same. So higher K implies shorter period because the planet is orbiting faster.

So planet #2 with K=7 has a shorter period than planet #1 with K=5. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1's. So P2 is about 0.36 * P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 compared to P1? So it's 0.36 times longer. So 0.36 times as long.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The velocity semi-amplitude, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet-star system. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass, both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the orbits are circular (\( e = 0 \)), the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes directly relates to the ratio of the orbital periods. Specifically:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating the ratio:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 36% as long as that of planet #1. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
