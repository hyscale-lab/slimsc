Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, which might be different from a cubic structure where angles are 90 degrees. So the given angles here are all 30 degrees, which is quite a change from the standard cubic setup.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a crystal would be the lattice parameter 'a' for a cubic system. But since this is rhombohedral, maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance? I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is the distance between adjacent atoms along the cube edges.

So, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed. All edges are of length 'a', and all angles are alpha, beta, gamma, which are all 30 degrees here.

The interplanar distance for a given plane (hkl) is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma_rhombo) ... wait, no, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles between them is more complex. But for a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and all angles are the same, so the formula simplifies.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But since rhombohedral isn't cubic, I need a different approach. I remember that the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice. The metric tensor components are:

a² [ 1          0          0        ]
[ 0   cos²g    sin²g * cos²g ]
Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the volume of the unit cell is a³ multiplied by the square root of (1 - 3cos²g + 2cos³g), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance when all sides are a and angles are gamma (since all angles are same, alpha=beta=gamma) is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk + hl + kl) cosγ ) / (a^3) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system comes from the plane's Miller indices (hkl) and the structure's lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal system, but wait, no, hexagonal has different symmetry. Alternatively, rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic where a = b = c.

Wait, maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar distance. I think the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (sin² α + sin² β + sin² γ) ) ) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, I remember the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( [ (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] )

Wait, but in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms are zero. So that reduces to a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

In this case, the rhombohedral system has alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30) )

Wait, let me write that out:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Since α = β = gamma = 30 degrees, and cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging in:

d = a / sqrt( 1 +1 +1 - 2(1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) + 1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) + 1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) ) )

Let's compute the denominator step by step.

Compute the first part: 1+1+1 =3.

Compute the second part: 2 * [ sum of the terms ]

Each term inside the brackets is 1*1 * sqrt(3)/2. There are three such terms: hk, hl, kl. So:

sum = 3 * ( (sqrt(3)/2) )

So the second part is 2 * sum = 2 * (3 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 sqrt(3).

Wait, wait, let me recheck that. The second part is 2*(hk cosγ + ... )

So for each term, hk is 1*1, multiplied by cos30. So each of the three terms is (1)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2. Summing all three terms: 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = (3 sqrt(3))/2.

Then multiply by 2: 2*(3 sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 sqrt(3).

Putting it all together:

denominator = sqrt( 3 - 3 sqrt(3) )

Wait, that can't be right. Because 3 - 3*sqrt(3) is a negative number. Oh wait, that can't be possible because denominator would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Perhaps the formula is:

d = ( a ) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2( hk cos(180 - alpha) + hl cos(180 - beta) + kl cos(180 - gamma) ) )

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula sign wrong.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the interplanar distance is given in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a_1 + k b_1 + l c_1 )^2 + (h a_2 + k b_2 + l c_2 )^2 + (h a_3 + k b_3 + l c_3 )^2 )

But for a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors can be expressed in terms of a and the angles.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula for any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosφ + kl cosψ) ) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another source I recall says that for a rhombohedral unit cell, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosα + kl cosα) )^(-1)

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let me verify.

So the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cosα + hl cosα + kl cosα) )

Wait, for a rhombohedral, all angles are same, so cosα = cosβ = cosgamma.

So the denominator becomes:

h² +k² + l^2 - 2 cosα ( hk + hl + kl )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 - 2 * cos30 * (1 +1 +1 ) = 3 - 6 cos30.

Now cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, so 6 * sqrt(3)/2 = 3 sqrt(3).

So denominator: 3 - 3 sqrt(3).

Wait, that's 3(1 - sqrt(3)). But sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1 - sqrt(3) is negative, which would make the denominator sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong in the formula. Maybe it's plus 2(...) instead of minus. Let me think about this.

Wait, in the cubic case, when angles are 90 degrees, cos(alpha) is 0, so the formula reduces to 1/sqrt(3), which is correct for (111) plane. So if I have:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk cosα + hl cosα + kl cosα) )

Wait, but in cubic with alpha=90, cos alpha=0, so denominator sqrt(3), correct. So for rhombohedral with angles smaller than 90, the distance would be different.

Wait, but in our case, the angles are 30 degrees, so cos(30) is positive, which would make the denominator larger. So let's try that formula.

So denominator is h² +k² + l² + 2( hk + hl + kl ) cos(30 )

Wait, for (111), h=k=l=1.

Sum of squares: 3.

Sum of products: (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 ) = 3.

So denominator becomes 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3)

Compute 3 +3*1.732= 3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator sqrt(8.196) ≈ sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Given a is 10 Angstrom, so d≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options start around 8.95 to 10.05. So that can't be right. I must have messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos( gamma ) + hl cos( beta ) + kl cos( alpha )) )

Wait, but in rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30, so cos(alpha)=cos(beta)=cos(gamma)=sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator is 3 - 2[ (1)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (1)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (1)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) ) ]

Which is 3 - 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Hmm, that's 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. So sqrt of a negative number is impossible. So perhaps the formula uses 180 - angle?

Wait, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors as they are in the unit cell. For a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is gamma, but perhaps in the formula, it's the angle used, which might be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Because in some conventions, the angle between vectors is the acute or obtuse angle, depending on how the vectors are arranged.

Wait, maybe I got the angle wrong. Because in the crystal, the angles between the lattice vectors are 30 degrees, but perhaps in the formula, it's the opposite, 180-30=150 degrees. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the acute angles could be between the vectors, but the formula might require the angles that are actually in the unit cell, which might be 150 degrees. Because if the structure is compressed, the angle between vectors could be 150, making the cos negative.

So let's try that. If instead of cos(30), we use cos(150), which is -sqrt(3)/2.

So the denominator becomes 3 - 2[ 3*(-sqrt(3)/2) ].

Wait, let me compute:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(hk cos(gamma) + ... )

Each term inside the brackets is 1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) for each of the three pairs (hk, hl, kl). So sum of the three terms is 3*(-sqrt(3)/2) → -3*(sqrt(3)/2).

Multiply by 2: 2 * (-3*sqrt(3)/2) )= -3*sqrt(3).

So denominator = sqrt( 3 - (-3*sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, no. Let me reevaluate. The formula is denominator = h² +k² + l² - 2*(sum of terms).

So in this case, h=k=l=1, so sum squares is 3.

The sum of terms is hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha. But if gamma, beta, alpha are 150 degrees, then cos is -sqrt(3)/2.

So each term is 1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2), so sum is -3*(sqrt(3)/2).

So 2*sum is 2 * (-3*sqrt(3)/2) )= -3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is 3 - (-3*sqrt(3)) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

Thus, d = a / 2.863.

a is 10 Angstrom, so d≈10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom. But the options are about 9 Angstroms. So that's way off.

So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula is the reciprocal of the square root of (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk cos gamma + ...) ), but we're using a different 'a'?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the lattice parameter with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But in rhombohedral, alpha = beta = gamma=30 degrees. So:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 [ (1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) ] )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )

= a / sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)) 

Hmm, 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196= -2.196. So the denominator is sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the formula uses the angles as 180 - 30=150 degrees, so cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2.

So substituting:

d= a / sqrt( 3 - 2 [ 3*(-sqrt(3)/2) ] )

= a / sqrt(3 - 2*(-3*sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3) )

Because the 2 and denominator 2 cancels.

So sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom, which again doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I've completely confused the approach. Maybe interatomic distance is different from the lattice parameter 'a'?

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a simple crystal structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' for a cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighboring atoms, which in a rhombohedral system might not be 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the unit cell. A rhombohedral unit cell has all edges equal and all angles same. So for a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would be 'a', but perhaps in the formula, 'a' is the edge length of the rhombohedron, not the nearest neighbor distance. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, that would be the 'a' value.

Wait, that seems correct. But then the earlier calculation gives d=3.49 Angstrom, which is not any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternative approach: think about the Bragg equation. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, another thought: In a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a/sqrt(3). So if a is 10, d=10/1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher, so maybe the rhombohedral structure causes the interplanar distance to be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the volume of the unit cell and find the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. The interplanar distance is 1/(sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) ), but scaled by the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2) ) + ... cross terms ... )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can use the general formula for a rhombohedral system.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a = b = c, and angles alpha=beta=gamma. The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ) ).

The formula for interplanar distance is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ) ) * (V/(a^3))^{1/2} )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / [ sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos gamma - 2kl cos gamma ) ]

Wait, another approach: use the relation between d-spacing and the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by h, k, l, and the metric tensor comes into play.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is:

G = [ 1          0              0             ]
     [ 0   cos^2 gamma   cos gamma sin gamma ]
     [ 0  cos gamma sin gamma   sin^2 gamma ]

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. For a rhombohedral lattice, the metric tensor is:

G = a^2 [ 1, cos gamma, cos gamma;
           cos gamma, 1, cos gamma;
           cos gamma, cos gamma, 1 ]

Because all sides are 'a', and the angles between each pair of vectors are gamma.

Wait, but wait, the metric tensor is used to compute the reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy:

G_{ij} = a^2 δ_ij - a^2 (1 - cos^2 gamma) δ_ij ??? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metric tensor components are:

G11 = a²,
G22 = a² cos² gamma,
G33 = a² cos² gamma,
G12 = G21 = a² cos gamma sin gamma,
G13 = G31 = a² cos gamma sin gamma,
G23 = G32 = a² cos² gamma.

Wait, no, perhaps the metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice with a=b=c=a0 and angles gamma between each pair of vectors is:

G = a0² [ 1 cos gamma cos gamma;
          cos gamma 1 cos gamma;
          cos gamma cos gamma 1 ]

So the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos gamma - 2 kl cos gamma ) ) multiplied by the square root of (a0^2 / V), where V is the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2( hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma ) ) * ( sqrt( a^3 / ( (1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha )) ) ) ) 

Wait, perhaps. Let me try to compute this.

First, compute the denominator part: h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos alpha + kl cos alpha )

For (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator part: 3 - 2*3*(cos 30) = 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 -3*sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that's impossible. So perhaps I have the angles wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles in the formula are 180 - gamma. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angle between the lattice vectors is gamma, but when building the reciprocal lattice, the angles used might be the supplements.

So cos(180 - gamma) = -cos gamma.

So, with gamma=30 degrees, using 180-30=150 degrees, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So the denominator becomes 3 - 2 (3*(-sqrt(3)/2) ) =3 - 2*(-3*sqrt(3)/2) )=3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3+5.196=8.196.

So the sqrt is sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

Now, compute the other part: sqrt( a^3 / (1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma ) )

Wait, the volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt( 1 -3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma ) 

Wait, so the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

cos gamma = cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2.

Compute cos^2 gamma: (3/4).

cos^3 gamma: (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, 1 -3*(3/4) +2*(3 sqrt(3)/8) = 1 - 9/4 + (6 sqrt(3))/8.

Which is (4/4 -9/4 ) + (3 sqrt(3)/4 ) = (-5/4 ) + (3 sqrt(3)/4 ) = ( -5 +3 sqrt(3) )/4.

So sqrt of this would be sqrt( ( -5 +3 sqrt(3) ) /4 )

Compute the numerator: -5 +3*1.732 ≈-5 +5.196≈0.196.

So sqrt(0.196/4)=sqrt(0.049)=0.221.

So V = a^3 * 0.221.

a is 10, so V = 1000 *0.221=221 Angstrom^3.

Now, the other part in the formula is sqrt( a^3 / V ) = sqrt(1000 / 221) ≈ sqrt(4.525) ≈2.127.

So putting it all together:

d = [1/2.863 ] * 2.127

Wait, because the general formula is:

d = [ 1 / sqrt( ... ) ] * [ sqrt( a^3 / V ) ]

So,

d = (1/2.863) * 2.127 ≈ (0.349) *2.127 ≈0.742 Angstrom.

That's way too small, and none of the options are near that. I must be making a mistake here.

Alternative approach: Maybe the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral is same as the cubic but multiplied by some factor because of the angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) * [1 / sqrt( 1 - cos^2 gamma ) ]

But I'm not sure. Let me try.

For cubic, d= a /sqrt(3) for (111). With a=10, d=5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher, so perhaps in rhombohedral, the interplanar distance is larger.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l² ) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, perhaps that's the right formula. Let me compute again.

With h=k=l=1, gamma=30 degrees.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3)*cos30 =3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 -3*sqrt(3)≈ -2.196.

Hmm, negative again. So not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l² ) + 2 ( hk cos(180 - gamma) + ... ) )

Which would change the sign of the cosine terms.

So with gamma=30, cos(180-30)=cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator becomes 3 +2*(3*(-sqrt(3)/2))=3 -3*sqrt(3)≈-2.196. Still negative.

Wait, maybe the formula should use 2*(...) but only if the angles are greater than 90, which in this case they're 30, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the inverse of the metric tensor to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The metric tensor G for a rhombohedral lattice is:

G = [ a², a² cos gamma, a² cos gamma;
      a² cos gamma, a², a² cos gamma;
      a² cos gamma, a² cos gamma, a² ]

So the reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G.

The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l), so the inverse metric tensor components G* are needed to compute the magnitude.

The magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is h² G*11 + k² G*22 + l² G*33 + 2hk G*12 + 2hl G*13 + 2kl G*23.

So the interplanar distance d is 1/sqrt( h² G*11 + k² G*22 + l² G*33 + 2hk G*12 + 2hl G*13 + 2kl G*23 )

But computing the inverse of G is a bit involved. Let's compute G inverse.

Given G is a 3x3 matrix with a² as diagonal and a² cos gamma off-diagonal except for the diagonal, which is a².

Wait, no, the off-diagonal terms in G are a² cos gamma, except in G12 and others.

Wait, the G matrix is:

[ a², a² c, a² c ]
[ a² c, a², a² c ]
[ a² c, a² c, a² ]

Where c = cos gamma.

We can compute the determinant of G to find the inverse.

But this might take a while. Let me denote the determinant as |G|.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal a, and off-diagonal b is:

|G|= a³ + 2 a b² - 3 a² b² ... Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the inverse of G.

The inverse of G would have elements:

G*11 = (G22 G33 - G23 G32) / |G|
G*12 = - (G12 G33 - G13 G32 ) / |G|
...

Wait, perhaps a shortcut is possible because all diagonal elements are the same and off-diagonal are same. Let me try to compute the inverse.

Let me denote the matrix as:

G = a² [ 1   c   c
          c   1   c
          c   c   1 ]

We can factor out a² from each element, so G = a² * M, where M is the matrix of 1's and c's.

The inverse of G is (1/a²) * M^{-1}.

So we need to compute M inverse.

The matrix M is:

[ 1 c c
  c 1 c
  c c 1 ]

Compute its determinant.

The determinant of M is:

1*(1*1 - c*c) - c*(c*1 - c*c) + c*(c*c -1*c )

=1*(1 - c²) - c*(c - c²) + c*(c² - c )

= (1 - c²) - c² + c³ + c^3 - c²

= 1 - c² -c² +c^3 +c^3 -c^2

= 1 - 3 c² +2 c^3

Which matches the volume expression I had earlier.

The inverse of M is (1/det(M)) * adjugate(M).

The adjugate is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

Compute cofactors for each element.

For M:

C11 = (+) determinant of [[1, c], [c, 1]] = 1*1 - c*c = 1 - c².

C12 = (-) determinant of [[c, c], [c, 1]] = -(c*1 - c*c) = -c(1 - c).

C13 = (+) determinant of [[c, 1], [c, c]] = c*c -1*c = c² -c.

C21 = (-) determinant of [[c, c], [c, 1]] = - (c*1 - c*c )= -c(1 -c ).

C22 = (+) determinant of [[1, c], [c,1]] = 1 -c².

C23 = (-) determinant of [[1, c], [c, c]] = -(1*c - c*c )= -c(1 - c).

C31 = (+) determinant of [[c, 1], [c, c]] = c*c - 1*c = c² -c.

C32 = (-) determinant of [[1, c], [c, c]] = -(1*c - c*c )= -c(1 -c).

C33 = (+) determinant of [[1, c], [c, c]] =1*c - c*c = c(1 -c).

So the adjugate matrix is:

[ C11 C12 C13
  C21 C22 C23
  C31 C32 C33 ]

Which is:

[ 1 - c², -c(1 - c), c² -c
  -c(1 - c), 1 -c², -c(1 - c)
  c² -c, -c(1 - c), c(1 - c) ]

So, M inverse is (1/det(M)) multiplied by this adjugate. So:

M^{-1} = (1/(1-3c² +2c^3)) * 
[
 [1 - c², -c(1 -c ), c² -c ],
 [ -c(1 -c ), 1 -c², -c(1 -c ) ],
 [ c² -c, -c(1 -c ), c(1 -c ) ]
]

Therefore, the inverse of G is (1/a²) * M^{-1}.

So, the reciprocal lattice metric tensor G* is (1/a²) * M^{-1}.

Now, the magnitude squared of the reciprocal lattice vector (h,k,l) is:

h² G*11 + k² G*22 + l² G*33 + 2hk G*12 + 2hl G*13 + 2kl G*23.

So,

= (1/a²) [ h² (1 - c²) + k² (1 - c²) + l² (c (1 - c)) + 2hk (-c (1 - c)) + 2hl (c² -c ) + 2kl (-c (1 - c)) ] / det(M)

Wait, no, because each element of G* is (1/a²) * element of M^{-1}.

Wait, no, let me be precise.

Each element of G* is (1/a²) * M^{-1}_ij. So,

G*11 = (1/a²)(1 - c²) / det(M)

Similarly for all elements.

So when we compute the magnitude squared:

= h² G*11 + k² G*22 + l² G*33 + 2 hk G*12 + 2 hl G*13 + 2 kl G*23.

Substituting each G*ij:

= (1/(a² det(M))) [ h² (1 - c²) + k² (1 - c²) + l² (c (1 -c )) 
 + 2 hk (-c (1 -c )) 
 + 2 hl (c² -c ) 
 + 2 kl (-c (1 -c )) 
 ]

Factor this:

= (1/(a² det(M))) [ (1 - c²)(h² +k²) + c (1 - c) l² 
 -2 c (1 -c ) hk 
 + 2 (c² -c) (hl) 
 -2 c (1 -c ) kl 
 ]

But this seems complicated. Let me plug in h=k=l=1 and c=cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2.

So c = sqrt(3)/2.

Compute each term:

1 - c² = 1 - (3/4) = 1/4.

c (1 - c ) = (sqrt(3)/2) ( 1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ( (2 - sqrt(3))/2 ) = sqrt(3)(2 - sqrt(3))/4.
