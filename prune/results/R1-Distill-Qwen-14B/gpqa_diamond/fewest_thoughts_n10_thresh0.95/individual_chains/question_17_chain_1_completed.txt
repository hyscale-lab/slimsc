Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I guess activity coefficients are 1, which would simplify things. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation for this problem.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant K is given. Formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and EDTA.

So the reaction is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something similar). Wait, let me think. The structure of EDTA is H4Y, which can lose protons. At the pH where it's ideal for Ca-EDTA formation, I think EDTA is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-.

So the formation equation would be:
Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

Wait, but wait, in solution, the complex might dissociate. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and free Y^4- depends on the concentration of the complex and the K value.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M initially. We can assume that the dissociation is minimal because K is very large, a big K means the reaction favors the formation of the complex, so the dissociation would be small.

So when the complex dissociates, it'll release some Ca²+ and Y^4-. Let me denote the change as x. So:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4-] = x

Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, it produces one mole each of Ca²+ and Y^4-.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

And we know K is 5e10 (since 5x10^10 is 5e10). So:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

I can solve for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, what's sqrt(4e-13)? Let me calculate that. sqrt(4) is 2. sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * sqrt(0.1) ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = ~6.32e-7.

Wait, that can't be right because 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.32e-7 M. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.0e-2 M — that's way too high, because the complex is 0.02 M and K is large, so free Ca should be less.

B) 5e-3 M — also seems high.

C) 6.3e-7 M — that's what I got.

D) 1e-2 M — higher than the complex's concentration, which doesn't make sense because the complex is 0.02 M.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So K is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, so x is small.

So the formula K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2 because (2e-6.5)^2 = 4e-13. Yeah, so x is 2e-6.5 M. What's 2e-6.5 in exponent terms? 6.5 is 6 and a half, so 1e-6 is 0.000001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7, because 2e-6 times sqrt(0.1) is 2e-6 * 0.316 = ~6.32e-7.

Yes, so x is 6.32e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \(x\) is very small),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Substituting \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Approximating \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M. Comparing this result with the options:

- **A)** \(2.0 \times 10^{-2}\) M: Too high.
- **B)** \(5.0 \times 10^{-3}\) M: Too high.
- **C)** \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M: Matches the calculated value.
- **D)** \(1.0 \times 10^{-2}\) M: Higher than the complex concentration, not possible.

The correct answer is **C**.
