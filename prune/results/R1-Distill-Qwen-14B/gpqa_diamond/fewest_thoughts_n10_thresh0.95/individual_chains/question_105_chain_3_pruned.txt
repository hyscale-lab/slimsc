Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. The star's rotation causes it to show brightness variations, which could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation. So, we're comparing the effect of the planet's transit to the star's spots.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But wait, the star's spots are also causing a dip, so we need to calculate the equivalent effect.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its radius and temperature. When spots are present, each spot is cooler, so it contributes less light. The overall effect on brightness is the sum of all the spots' contributions.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, so the area covered is 20% of (4πRstar²)/2 because it's only one hemisphere. Wait, actually, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar²) because a hemisphere has area 2π R², but wait no, wait.

Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So if spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, the area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². But wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, so for the entire star, if the spots are on one hemisphere, their total surface area is 20% of the star's surface area. Wait no, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Hmm, so that might be 20% of the hemisphere's area, not the entire star. Oh, but wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Because the star is a sphere, one hemisphere is half the surface. So if the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, that's 10% of the total surface area. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². If the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, that's 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area (since 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, or 10%).

But wait, maybe the filling factor is given as 20% for the entire star. No, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor refers to the hemisphere only. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4π R².

Each spot is cooler, at 5000K because the star is 6000K and the difference is 1000K. So each spot emits less flux.

The total flux from the star without spots is L = 4πR² * σ T^4. When there are spots, the total flux is L = (1 - f) * 4πR² * σ T_eff^4 + f * 4πR² * σ (T_eff - 1000)^4. Wait, no, because f is the filling factor. So the area without spots is (1-f) of the star's surface, each at T_eff, and f is the area of spots, each at (T_eff - 1000) K.

So the total flux F = (1-f) * (4π R²) * σ T_eff^4 + f * (4π R²) * σ (T_eff - delta T)^4.

But wait, the problem says that the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So spot temperature is 5000K.

So F = (1-f) * (4π R² σ (6000^4)) + f * (4π R² σ (5000^4)).

But in this case, f is the area fraction of the entire star. Wait, earlier I thought f was 0.2, but perhaps the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the total f for the entire star is 0.2*(hemisphere) / (star's surface) = 0.2 * (2π R²) / (4π R²) )= 0.1. So f = 0.1.

Wait, but the question says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So if the hemisphere is 2π R², then 20% of that is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the entire star's surface area. So f = 0.1.

So now, the total flux when spots are present is:

F = (1 - 0.1) * 4π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.1 * 4π R² σ (5000)^4.

We can factor out 4π R² σ:

F = 4π R² σ [ (0.9)(6000^4) + 0.1 (5000^4) ]

The original flux without spots would be 4π R² σ (6000^4). So the brightness variation (the dip) would be the difference between the original flux and the flux with spots:

delta F = F_original - F_spots = 4π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.9*6000^4 + 0.1*5000^4) ]

Let me compute that.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So, 0.9 * 6000^4 = 0.9 * 1296e12 = 1166.4e12.

0.1 *5000^4 = 0.1 *625e12 = 62.5e12.

So, sum = 1166.4 + 62.5 = 1228.9e12.

Original term is 1296e12.

So delta F = 4π R² σ (1296e12 - 1228.9e12 ) = 4π R² σ (67.1e12).

So the dip in flux is 67.1e12 divided by the original 1296e12, times 100% to get the fractional dip.

So fractional dip due to spots, delta F / F_original = (67.1e12) / (1296e12) ) = 67.1 / 1296 ≈ 0.05175, or about 5.175% dip.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the star's brightness variation is caused by the spots and that it can resemble an exoplanet. The question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation. So the amplitude of the dip is the same.

In the case of a planet transit, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to (R_p/R_*)^2.

So the dip when the planet transits is (R_p / R_*)^2 = (R_p^2 / R_*^2).

So to get the same amplitude as the spot-induced dip (which is approximately 5.175% dip), the planet's dip would be (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05175.

So solving for R_p / R_*:

R_p / R_* = sqrt(0.05175) ≈ sqrt(0.05) ≈ 0.2236, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.05175:

sqrt(0.05175) ≈ sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. Let me compute 0.05175:

0.05175 = 5175e-5.

Calculating sqrt(5175e-5) could be approached as:

I know that 0.05175 ≈ 0.0518.

Let's compute sqrt(0.0518):

approximates to 0.2276. Because 0.2276^2 = 0.0518.

Wait, 0.2276 * 0.2276 = ?

0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

0.2 * 0.0276 = ~0.00552.

0.0276 *0.2 = same as above.

0.0276^2 = about 0.00076.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.2276^2:

= (0.2 + 0.0276)^2 = 0.2^2 + 2*0.2*0.0276 + 0.0276^2.

= 0.04 + 0.01104 + 0.00076176 ≈ 0.04 + 0.01104 = 0.05104 + 0.00076176 ≈ 0.05180176.

So 0.2276^2 ≈ 0.0518, which matches our value of 0.05175. So sqrt(0.05175) is approximately 0.2276.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 0.2276^2 again.

0.2276 * 0.2276:

Let's compute step by step:

0.22 * 0.22 = 0.0484.

0.22 * 0.0076 = 0.001672.

0.0076 * 0.22 = same as above.

0.0076 * 0.0076 = 0.00005776.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exact square:

(2276 * 1e-4)^2 = (2276)^2 * 1e-8.

2276^2 = let's compute 2276 * 2276.

Well, 2276 * 2000 = 4,552,000.

2276 * 276 = ?

2276 * 200 = 455,200.

2276 *70 = 159,320.

2276 *6=13,656.

Adding up: 455,200 + 159,320 = 614,520. +13,656 = 628,176.

So total 4,552,000 + 628,176 = 5,180,176.

So (2276)^2 = 5,180,176. So (2276e-4)^2 = 5,180,176e-8 = 0.05180176.

Which is exactly what we have. So yes, sqrt(0.05175) ≈ 0.2276.

So R_p / R_* ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.228. But let me check the options again.

The options given are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, none of the options are around 0.227. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the dip due to the spots. Let's double-check that.

So the dip in flux is the difference between the star's original flux and the flux when spots are present.

Original flux F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Flux with spots F = (0.9)(6000^4) + 0.1(5000^4) ) * 4π R² σ.

So F = 4π R² σ [0.9*(6e3)^4 + 0.1*(5e3)^4 ]

Calculating each term:

(6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

(5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 0.9 * 1296e12 = 1166.4e12.

0.1 *625e12 =62.5e12.

Sum: 1166.4 +62.5 = 1228.9e12.

F0's term is 1296e12.

So F = 4π R² σ *1228.9e12.

F0 = 4π R² σ *1296e12.

So the dip in brightness is F0 - F = 4π R² σ (1296 - 1228.9) e12 = 4π R² σ 67.1e12.

The fractional dip is (67.1e12) / (1296e12 ) = 67.1 / 1296 ≈ 0.05175, so 5.175% dip.

So the dip from the planet would need to be the same, 5.175%.

The dip from a planet is (R_p/R_*)^2, so we set that equal to 0.05175.

So R_p/R_* = sqrt(0.05175) ≈ 0.2276.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, but that's higher than 0.227. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the fraction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the brightness variation as the change due to the spots as the planet would cause the same variation. But in the case of spots, the variation is a dip, but in the case of a planet, it's also a dip. So the dip's amplitude is the same.

Wait, perhaps instead, the question is that without spots, the star's brightness is F0. The spots cause a dip, but the question asks what exoplanet radius would cause the same dip in the star's brightness. So the exoplanet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0, and the spots cause a dip of (F0 - F_spots), which is 0.05175 F0. So the planet's dip should be 0.05175, so Rp^2 / Rstar^2 = 0.05175 => Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05175) ≈0.227.

But none of the options are close to 0.227. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the filling factor. Let me reevaluate.

The problem states: one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The total area of the star is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of 2π R² is 0.4π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4π R². So the filling factor f for the entire star is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, as I had before.

Hmm. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the flux contribution from the spots and the unspotted area more carefully.

Another approach: the flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

The flux with spots is F = (F_unspotted) + (F_spotted).

F_unspotted = sigma (6000)^4 * (1 - f) * 4 pi R^2.

F_spotted = sigma (5000)^4 * f *4 pi R^2.

So F = sigma 4 pi R^2 [ (1-f) *6000^4 + f *5000^4 ]

Thus, the fractional dip is (F0 - F) / F0.

(F0 - F) = sigma 4 pi R^2 [ (1 - f) 6000^4 - ( (1-f) 6000^4 + f 5000^4 ) ) ]

Wait, no. F0 is sigma 4 pi R^2 6000^4.

F = sigma 4 pi R^2 [ (1-f) 6000^4 + f 5000^4 ]

So F0 - F = sigma 4 pi R^2 [6000^4 - ( (1-f)6000^4 + f 5000^4 ) ]

= sigma 4 pi R^2 [ f (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

So the dip is (F0 - F) = F0 * [ f (6000^4 - 5000^4) / 6000^4 ]

So the fractional dip is [ f ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ) ].

Wait, that seems more straightforward.

So let's compute this.

Compute (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

6000^4 = 1.296e16 (since (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15? Wait, wait, 6e3 is 6,000, so (6e3)^4 = (6^4)*(1e3)^4 )= 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5e3^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4) /6e3^4 = (1.296e15 - 6.25e14)/1.296e15.

= (1.296e15 - 0.625e15)/1.296e15.

= (0.671e15) / 1.296e15 = 0.671 / 1.296 ≈ 0.5175.

Wait, 0.671 / 1.296 is about 0.5175. So the term becomes f * 0.5175.

f is 0.1.

So fractional dip is 0.1 * 0.5175 = 0.05175, same as before.

So back to the same fractional dip of 5.175%.

So the exoplanet's dip must be the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05175) ≈ 0.2276.

But looking at the options, the closest is not present. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that the dip from spots is the same as the dip from the planet. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the rotation of the star, which only shows a certain part of the spots at a time, but the planet transits fully. But in that case, the maximum dip from the spots would be when the maximum area is blocked (when the hemisphere with spots is facing us). But in the problem statement, the star is observed to have brightness variations due to rotation, which have the same amplitude as the planet's effect. So perhaps the dip from the spots (when maximum spots are visible) is 5.175%, which is the same as the planet's dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.227.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32, which is 0.32. But wait, that's much higher than 0.227. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the planet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. But perhaps the star's dip from the spots is in the same direction as the planet's. Wait, when the spots are on the far side of the star, the star appears brighter because the cooler spots are not contributing as much. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the flux decreases when the spots are visible, and increases when the spots are not visible. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be twice the dip. Or maybe the variation is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the maximum and minimum brightness.

When the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is maximum (F_max), and when the spots are on the near side, it's minimum (F_min).

Wait, no, when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the star's flux is lower, so F_min = F.

When the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, F_max = F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/F0.

Which would be (F0 - F)/F0 = 0.05175, which is about 5.175%.

But wait, perhaps the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, so twice the dip. So peak-to-peak would be 2 * 5.175% = 10.35%. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation when the spots rotate into and out of view, and the maximum dip is 5.175%, so the same dip as the planet.

In that case, the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227, as before.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spots are only on one hemisphere, which means that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a 5.175% dip, and when they are on the far side, the brightness is higher. So the amplitude is the difference between when spots are visible and when they're not, which is 5.175%.

But if the planet causes the same amplitude, then the dip is 5.175%.

Hmm. But the given options don't have 0.227. So perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor. Let me recheck.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spots are on a single face of the star, not the entire hemisphere. So the area is 20% of the star's surface. Wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. So 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the fractional dip.

Wait, let me recompute the fractional dip.

The original flux is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

The flux with spots is F = 4π R² σ [ (1-f) (6000^4) + f (5000^4) ].

f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / (total area).

Hemisphere area: 2π R².

Total area: 4π R².

So f = (0.2 * 2π R²) / (4π R² ) = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1.

Yes, correct.

So F = 4π R² σ [ 0.9*(6e3)^4 + 0.1*(5e3)^4 ]

Compute the terms:

0.9 * 6e3^4 = 0.9 * 1.296e15 = 1.1664e15.

0.1 *5e3^4 = 0.1 *6.25e14 =6.25e13.

So F's term is 1.1664e15 + 6.25e13 = 1.1664e15 + 0.0625e15 = 1.2289e15.

F0 is 1.296e15.

So F0 - F = 1.296e15 - 1.2289e15 = 6.71e13.

Fractional dip: 6.71e13 / 1.296e15 = 0.05175, which is 5.175%.

So the dip is 5.175% of the original flux.

Thus, to get the same dip, the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the relative brightness variation, not the dip. Alternatively, perhaps the spots cause a variation in brightness which is the same as a planet, but in the opposite way. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness variation due to spots depends on the rotational period and the size of the spots, but for the purpose of the amplitude, perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the planet's area to match the area of the spots. Wait, no, because the planet's effect is a dip when it transits. The spots cause a dip based on their area and temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the maximum possible dip from the spots. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view, which would be the maximum dip. So perhaps the dip is 5.175%, and the planet's dip is the same, leading to R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.05175) ≈ 0.227. But again, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39 → about 0.39.

B) ~0.07 → 0.07.

C) ~0.11 → 0.11.

D) ~0.32 → 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and the amplitude is the same as an exoplanet, but the dip from the planet is when the planet transits, which blocks a certain fraction. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But as per our calculation, that dip is 5.175% → R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.227. 

Hmm. But the given options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem's situation is that the star's brightness variation is caused by the spots, and that this variation is the same as the variation caused by a planet. But perhaps the planet's transit would have a larger effect than the spot's dip because the star's spots are cooler, so the dip is less.

Wait, no, because the dip in brightness is due to the blocked light. The spots cause a dip because the spots are cooler and thus contribute less light than the surrounding areas. Wait, no, when the spots are on the near side, the star appears dimmer because those cooler spots are contributing less flux than the same area would if it were at the star's temperature. So the dip in flux is (f) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps the dip is not (F0 - F)/F0, but (F_max - F_min)/F0, where F_max is when no spots are visible, and F_min is when all spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the maximum and minimum fluxes.

When the star is viewed with the non-spotty hemisphere, the flux is F_max = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the flux is F_min = (1 - f) * 4π R² σ (6000)^4 + f * 4π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but earlier I was considering the dip as F0 - F_min, which is the same as (F_max - F_min) because F0 = F_max.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = delta F.

Which we calculated as 0.05175 or 5.175%.

So to get the same amplitude, the planet's dip must be 5.175%.

But again, the same conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's transit. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which must equal 0.05175.

But again, that gives Rp/Rstar ≈0.227.

Wait, but the options given don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps the filling factor is miscalculated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the star is only partially covered by spots, so the variation in brightness when the star rotates is only as much as if the spots were a planet. So the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side, which is the same as the dip from a planet.

So perhaps the dip is 5.175%, as before.

But again, the options don't match. So perhaps I should re-examine the question.

Wait, the question says, "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So the amplitude of the signal is the same as if it were caused by a planet.

Hmm. So the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, but the amplitude is the same as a planet's transit. So I need to find Rp such that the transit dip is the same as the dip from spots.

So, same conclusion: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's spots are causing a variation that mimics a planet transit, but the amplitude is similar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's emission, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But that's what we've done.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's radius as a fraction of the star's, but in the case of the spots, the effective area is less. Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Stefan-Boltzmann law differently. Let me make sure.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that flux is proportional to T^4. So each spot's flux is (5000/6000)^4 of the surrounding area.

So for a spot area f, the total flux is (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * (T_spot)^4.

So the fractional dip is f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ].

Which in this case is f * [1 - (5/6)^4 ].

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.1 → 0.0517747, which matches our earlier calculation of 5.175%.

So same result.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read again.

The question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

So, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, the amplitude is the same as caused by the spots.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which equals the dip from the spots, which is 0.05175.

Thus, Rp = 0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to cause the same variation as the maximum spot coverage, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the spots are causing a variation that is double the dip because the star's brightness alternates between when the spots are visible and not. So the amplitude would be twice the dip.

Wait, the amplitude in a light curve is often defined as the peak-to-peak variation. So if the star's brightness varies between F_max and F_min, the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min) × 100%, but sometimes it's defined as (F_max - F_min)/F_max ×100%.

In our case, F_max = F0 (no spots visible), F_min = F (spots visible). So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = 5.175%.

If the planet's transit causes a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar≈0.227.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the planet radius that would cause a dip of 5.175% of the star's flux.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp ≈0.227 Rstar.

Rounding, about 0.23. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the planet's transit as causing a variation similar to the star's spots, but the spots are causing a variation that's higher than the planet's.

Wait, perhaps I have to find the planet radius such that the dip is 5.175%, but that would require Rp ≈0.227 Rstar.

But looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option D) 0.32, which is 0.32, but that's more than 0.227. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the dip from the spots is the same as the planet's dip. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's transit as covering a certain area, but the spots are cooler, so the effect is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation caused by the spots is a combination of the spot's area and their lower temperature. The planet's effect is just blocking a part of the star's light, regardless of temperature. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Thus, to have the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = fractional dip from spots, which is 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.227.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the planet's effect.

The planet's effect is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp = 0.227 Rstar.

So the answer would be approximately 0.23 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's setup.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature isn't directly relevant, but only the temperature difference. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

The spots contribute F_sp = sigma (Teff - delta T)^4 * area of spots.

But perhaps I should calculate the flux from the spots as a fraction of the total flux.

Wait, the total
