Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a hypothetical situation. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. I need to find the ratio of flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches. The pp-I branch is the simplest, involving just protons converting into helium. The pp-II and pp-III branches involve higher energy steps, maybe? Or perhaps it's more about which isotopes are involved. Oh right, the pp-III branch probably involves boron-8 production. Because I remember that the pp-III branch is the one where two protons collide to form boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei and two positrons.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the pp chain. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the Beryllium process. So when a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton, it creates two helium-4s and emits neutrinos. So, if the pp-III branch stops, that particular source of neutrinos would be cut off.

Now, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies compared to the others. Because the pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos, right? Or wait, maybe the neutrinos from different branches have different energy distributions. So if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos would decrease.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So both are high-energy neutrinos, but band 2 is higher than band 1.

If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected? Well, the pp-III branch is a major source of high-energy neutrinos. So if that stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop more than lower ones.

But wait, the question is about neutrino flux. The flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that branch are no longer being produced. So the flux in the higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease more, while the lower bands (like 700-800) might be less affected, but wait, does the pp-III contribute to both bands or just the higher?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy spectrum of the neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies up to about 1.4 MeV, I think. So both bands 1 and 2 are within that range. But the main point is that the pp-III branch contributes a significant amount of the high-energy neutrinos.

So before the pp-III stopped, the flux in both bands was coming from various sources. But after stopping, the pp-III neutrinos (which are high-energy) are gone. So for the higher band (800-900 keV), much of the flux comes from pp-III, so the flux there drops. Whereas for the 700-800 keV band, perhaps the main source is other branches like the pp-I or others, which are not affected. Or maybe the main source even for 700-800 is the pp-III?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The main neutrino production in the Sun is from the proton-proton chain. The dominant process is the pp-I branch, which produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are minor contributors but produce higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos would be significantly reduced.

So the neutrino flux above a certain energy, like 800 keV, would drop because the pp-III is gone. But the lower energy bands (like 700-800) would be less affected. Or perhaps even that band is still getting some neutrinos from other sources.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in two bands. So, what was the flux in each band before and after.

Wait, the pp-III contributes more to the higher energy neutrinos. So, before the pp-III stopped, both bands had some contribution. After stopping, the higher band (800-900) would lose a lot of its flux, but the lower band (700-800) would lose less, but wait, perhaps not if their main source is the same.

Wait, perhaps band 1 (700-800) is dominated by the pp-I branch, and band 2 (800-900) is dominated by the pp-III. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 drops to almost zero. But band 1's flux remains roughly the same as before.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies around 0.5 MeV and below. Wait, no, wait. I think the pp-I branch involves a proton converting into a neutron by capturing an electron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino is about 0.4 MeV. So maybe the pp-I doesn't contribute to the higher bands. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos.

So the main high-energy neutrinos (above 0.5 MeV) come from the pp-II and pp-III processes. So if the pp-III is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (800-900 keV) would be mostly from pp-II, which is a minor contributor, but perhaps the flux in the 800-900 keV band would be reduced.

Wait, but when the pp-III stops, the total number of high-energy neutrinos (including those in both bands) would drop. So, the relative contributions of each band would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 2 (800-900) comes mainly from the pp-III branch, while band 1 comes from a mix of sources, including the pp-I and others.

So before the pp-III stopped, both bands had some flux, but band 2 had more from pp-III. After stopping, the flux in band 2 would drop a lot, while band 1 would have a smaller drop, or perhaps no drop if its main sources are unaffected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2. So, the flux in band 1 is F1, and band 2 is F2.

If F2 is primarily from pp-III, which is now gone, then F2 would drop significantly. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But by how much? The options are 10, 1, 0.1, or 0.01.

Hmm. I think that the pp-III branch contributes a significant portion of the high-energy neutrinos. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher energy bands would drop, while lower ones (like the 700-800 keV band) would remain more or less the same.

So if F2 was previously, say, 10% from pp-III (I’m making up numbers), then stopping pp-III would reduce F2 to 0. But that seems unlikely because I think the pp-III contributes a larger fraction of the high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for about 10% of the Sun's total neutrino flux. Or maybe it's a small percentage but contributes to the high-energy part.

Wait, I think the total neutrino flux from the Sun is made up mostly of the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are minor but contribute higher-energy neutrinos. So, if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrino flux would decrease, but the lower-energy flux would remain similar.

In the scenario, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So, neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) are primarily from the pp-III. So, their flux would drop, while band 1 (700-800) might not be as severely affected.

Wait, but maybe the pp-III produces neutrinos in the higher end, like 1-2 MeV. So the 700-800 band is still lower than that. So maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute to band 1, so the flux in band 1 would remain the same. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy spectrum. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies up to about 1.4 MeV. So, neutrinos in 700-800 and 800-900 keV would be within that range. So the pp-III contributes to both bands, but more to the higher one.

So, band 2 (800-900) has a higher energy, so more of its flux comes from the pp-III. If the pp-III stops, band 2's flux would drop more. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

For example, suppose before stopping, band 1 flux was F1 and band 2 was F2. After stopping, F2 drops to a fraction (like F2' = F2 * (some factor)), while F1 remains F1 (if its sources are unaffected). Wait, but does F1 have any contribution from pp-III?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a large fraction of the flux in band 2, but a smaller fraction in band 1.

So before stopping, F2 was, say, 90% from pp-III and 10% from others. After stopping, F2 would be 10% of its original, because the pp-III contribution is gone. Whereas F1, perhaps 50% from pp-III and 50% from others. So F1 would drop to 50% of original, but since others are still contributing, the drop is less.

But I'm not sure of the exact percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source for the higher band. So, if pp-III stops, band 2 flux is almost zero, while band 1 is still getting neutrinos from other processes.

So F1 would remain as before, F2 would drop to near zero. Then the ratio F1/F2 would be very large, like 10 or more.

But the options include 10 as option A. So maybe the answer is A) 10.

Wait, but neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II might contribute to band 1, while band 2 is mainly from pp-III.

Wait, another approach: the energy spectrum of the solar neutrinos peaks at around 0.3 MeV (from pp-I), and the higher energy neutrinos (above 0.5 MeV) are a small fraction. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at higher energies, so when that stops, the higher energy neutrinos would drop.

So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), which is 0.7-0.8 MeV, the flux is mainly from pp-III. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (and band 2) would drop. But band 2 is even higher, so perhaps the drop is more significant.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the neutrino flux distribution. The majority of solar neutrinos have energies below 1 MeV, with a peak around 0.3 MeV. So even the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are in the higher end, but not the extreme.

So, the pp-III branch contributes to the higher end. So, if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) would drop, but lower ones (like 0.7-0.8) might still have some flux from other sources.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) are both produced by the same process, like the pp-III. So, stopping pp-III would reduce both bands, but band 2 is higher energy, so perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band 2.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be approximately the same as before, but both F1 and F2 drop. But that doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces a broader spectrum, with more flux in higher energies. So, for the same pp-III contribution, the flux in band 2 would be higher than in band 1. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1.

But I'm not exactly sure about the shape of the spectrum. Alternatively, perhaps the flux in higher energy bands is lower than lower ones, but that doesn't make sense because higher energy particles are less probable in a thermal distribution.

Wait, actually, in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, higher energies are less probable. So the number of high-energy neutrinos is lower. So the flux in band 2 would be lower than in band 1, even without considering the pp-III stopping.

But in this question, the pp-III contributes more to the higher energies, not the lower.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III branch produces about 10-20% of the solar neutrinos. So, if the pp-III stops, the total neutrino flux from the Sun would drop by that percentage. But the question is about the ratio between two bands.

Suppose that all the neutrinos in band 2 come from the pp-III. Then, stopping pp-III would make F2 drop to zero, while F1 remains as it was. So the ratio F1/F2 would be F1 / 0, which is undefined. But the options don't include that, so perhaps the bands have some contribution from other sources.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a certain fraction to each band. Let's say for band 1, 20% from pp-III, and 80% from others. For band 2, 80% from pp-III, 20% from others. Then, if pp-III stops, F1 becomes 80% of original, F2 becomes 20% of original. So the ratio F1/F2 would be (0.8 F)/(0.2 F) = 4. So the ratio is 4, which isn't an option. So perhaps the contributions are more skewed.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes 90% of the flux in band 2, and 10% in band 1. So when it stops, band 2's flux drops by 90%, band 1's by 10%. So F1 becomes 90% original, F2 becomes 10% original. So F1/F2 ratio is 9. So about 10, which is option A.

But wait, the options are given with 10 as option A and 0.1 as D. So in this case, the ratio would be 9, which is close to 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes 95% of band 2 and 5% of band 1. Then, after stopping, F2 is 5%, F1 is 95%. So ratio is 19, which is about 10. So option A.

Therefore, the ratio F1/F2 would be approximately 10.

Wait, but another thought: neutrino production from pp-III is a minor part of the total flux. So perhaps even if it stops, the change in the ratio isn't that extreme.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in band 1 and band 2 were both significantly affected, but the ratio remains about the same. So the ratio F1/F2 would be roughly 1, option C.

But that doesn't seem right. If the pp-III's contribution is mainly in higher energies, then the ratio would change.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the key is that the pp-III contributes a significant fraction to the higher energy bands. So, without it, the higher band (band 2) has much less flux, while the lower band (band 1) is less affected. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

Looking at the options, 10 is an option (A), which would be the case if F2's flux drops a lot more than F1's.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, primarily in the range of 1-2 MeV. These neutrinos contribute significantly to the flux in the higher energy bands, such as 800-900 keV, but less so in the 700-800 keV band.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production and Energy Bands**:
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies up to ~1.4 MeV, contributing to both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. However, the higher energy band (800-900 keV) is more strongly affected by the pp-III branch.
   - The pp-I branch, which dominates the total neutrino flux, produces lower-energy neutrinos (around 0.4 MeV), contributing less to the higher energy bands.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the total neutrino flux but is the primary source of high-energy neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) will drop significantly, while the flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) will be less affected.
   - The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) will remain relatively stable because it still receives contributions from other processes, such as the pp-I branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, both bands have some contribution from the pp-III branch, but band 2 is more dependent on it.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 will drop significantly, while band 1 will remain largely unchanged. This increases the ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2.

4. **Estimating the Ratio**:
   - If the pp-III branch contributes, for example, 90% of the flux in band 2 and 10% of the flux in band 1, stopping the pp-III branch would reduce the flux in band 2 to 10% of its original value and in band 1 to 90% of its original value. The ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \) would then be approximately \( 90\% / 10\% = 9 \), which is close to 10.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between the two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) increases significantly after the pp-III branch stops, primarily due to the larger reduction in flux in the higher energy band. The most reasonable estimate for the ratio is approximately 10.
