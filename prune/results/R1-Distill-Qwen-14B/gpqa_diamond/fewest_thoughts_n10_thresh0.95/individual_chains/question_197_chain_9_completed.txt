--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe something like an ester or a nitrile. Wait, no, more specifically, red phosphorus with HI is often used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Or wait, wait, maybe it's for the conversion of esters to acids? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, it's used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but that might be with just water. Wait, no, red phosphorus is used in the H3PO4 and HI for the hydrolysis of esters or maybe for dehydrohalogenation? I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think. The reaction is between compound X and red phosphorus + HI. Oh right, I think when you have an ester and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Or was it nitriles? Wait, nitriles reacting with HI and red phosphorus... I think that's the one. Nitriles (like RCN) when treated with H2O and acid would hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, but with red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different pathway. Wait, alternatively, maybe it's a Hoffman degradation? No, Hoffman uses hypochlorites and amines. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide, like dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, but if the starting material is an ester, maybe it's more about the saponification. Wait, no, saponification is with NaOH. If it's an ester reacting with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a transesterification or some other reaction.

Wait, I should look at the spectral data to figure out what compound X is. Let's start by analyzing the IR and NMR.

The IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300, usually a very broad peak. The 1720 cm-1 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700 cm-1, sometimes a bit lower. So 1720 might be more like an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches.

The NMR data: Let's look at the 1H NMR.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is likely an O-H proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm and a triplet or something. Wait, but aldehydes are around 9-10, and broad might indicate exchange, like in a carboxylic acid. So if there's a peak at 10.5, that's probably a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, carboxylic acids are usually broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So if X is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense.

Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Because each doublet has 2H, so for each substituent, maybe.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a methine (CH) group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or part of a CH2 group. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – this could be a CH2 connected to something. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or another CH. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting that together: Let's try to imagine the structure.

The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid group. So perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. The aromatic protons are para-substituted, so two substituents in the para positions of the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests a substitution pattern where two protons are in one position and two in another. For example, if the substituent is a group like -COOH in the para position, then the adjacent protons (ortho to substituent) would be at higher ppm than those meta. Wait, para substituted would have two sets of protons: ortho and meta. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the ortho and para positions are each substituted. Wait, no, in a mono-substituted benzene, the ring is o/p disubstituted? No, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is in one position, and the other substituents are in the para position? Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, if the benzene is substituted with two groups in the para positions. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions. But wait, a benzene ring can't have substituents in the same position. So if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but that would be the same as para.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions, which is para. So the substituent in position 1 is a -COOH group, and in position 4 is another group. Or perhaps it's a substituent that is itself in the para position relative to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two different groups in the para positions. For example, a -COOH in position 1 and a CH2CH2CH3 group in position 4. Wait, but how would that look on the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions, but that's meta. Hmm.

Wait, the aromatic region is 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Because in such a case, the protons in the ortho positions to each substituent would be split into two sets of doublets.

Wait, let me think about this. Let's consider benzene with two substituents in the para positions. For example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 3, but that's meta. Wait, no, if substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B is in position 4, that's para. So the structure would be 1,4-disubstituted.

Wait, but wait, in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is para to each other. So the protons adjacent to substituent A (in position 1) would be ortho (positions 2 and 6), and the protons adjacent to substituent B (position 4) would be ortho (positions 3 and 5). So in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be one set, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be another set. Depending on the substituents, they might have different chemical shifts.

Alternatively, if the substituent is -COOH at position 1 and another group (like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something) at position 4, then the aromatic protons ortho to the -COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those ortho to the other substituent.

So 8.0 ppm would be the protons ortho to the -COOH, and 7.2 ppm those ortho to the other substituent.

So now, the other substituent is at position 4. Let's see the rest of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a CH group, maybe between two carbons. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH which is itself attached to another group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: Maybe the substituent at position 4 is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Let me try to draw this.

So the benzene ring has a -COOH group at position 1 and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4. Wait, but the CH2CH(CH2CH3) would be a branching point.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)-O- group? No, the NMR doesn't show an oxygen except for the carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think again. Let's see, the substituent at position 4 is a group that has a CH connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3). Or perhaps a CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-C(OH)-something? No, perhaps not. Let's think about the 1.4 ppm doublet, which is 3H. That's a methyl group attached to a CH, which in turn is attached to something else. So perhaps a structure like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, the 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH3, so that would be the end of an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me try to see. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH(CH3). So maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but with the CH being next to the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group. So the benzene has a -COOH group and a -sec-butyl group in para positions.

Wait, let me think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be at position 4.

So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the NMR:

The aromatic protons: the o to -COOH would be more deshielded, so higher ppm (8.0 ppm), and the o to sec-butyl would be less deshielded, around 7.2 ppm. That fits.

Then the substituent: the -sec-butyl group. Let's break it down.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene? Or is it -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- ? No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3) ? No, wait, correction: The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached via the secondary carbon. So it's:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, wait: the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's actually a tertiary structure. Oh wait, no, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but attached at the secondary carbon.

Ah, wait, no. Wait, the iso-butyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-, but that's not right. Let me clarify:

Butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-, straight chain.

iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but actually, iso-butyl is (CH2CH2)CH(CH3)-? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but attached in such a way that the branching is correct.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure is benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group in para positions.

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, meaning the CH2 is connected to the benzene, then a CH connected to another CH2CH3. So the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group? Or perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's see. The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). That would make it a 2-methylpropyl group. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a 3-methylpropyl group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR shifts:

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably the CH in the substituent. So, that CH is adjacent to a CH2 and a CH2CH3.

Wait, the substituent's structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the CH in the middle is connected to two CH2 groups and a CH2CH3. So the CH2 would be adjacent to the benzene, then a CH, then a CH2CH3.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the NMR signals:

The CH in the substituent would be at 2.9 ppm, as a multiplet. The CH2 next to the benzene would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH(CH2CH3) would have its own protons. Wait, but the CH2CH3 is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. That makes the substituent a 3-methylbutyl group? Or perhaps a 2-methylpropyl?

Wait, another approach: looking at the substituent's NMR.

The substituent is a chain connected to the benzene. The signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): that's a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): that's a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl.

So the structure could be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-something?

Wait, perhaps:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)- ?

No, wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. No, that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH(CH3))- group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, considering the substituent as a propyl group with branching. Let's say the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would make it a 3-methylpropyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a CH connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH2 group which is connected to the benzene.

Wait, that would make the substituent a 2-methylpropyl group, which is a sec-butyl. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the benzene has a -COOH group in position 1 and a -sec-butyl group in position 4. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have the propanoic acid attached to the benzene at position 2, but our substituent is at position 4, and the acid is in position 1.

Wait, no, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That fits.

So, compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's the product?

Wait, I need to think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, they can be used in the cleavage of alkenes. Alternatively, I think they are used in the hydrolysis of esters.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, then what's the reaction with red phosphorus and HI? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm wrong about X's structure.

Wait, let's double-check. If X is a benzoic acid, then the IR would have a peak around 1700 cm-1, and the broad O-H around 3000. The IR given has a peak at 1720, which is higher than a typical carboxylic acid (which is around 1700), so maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but earlier I thought the 10.5 ppm was a carboxylic acid O-H, but if X is an ester, then the IR would have a peak at 1720 (ester carbonyl), but then where's the O-H? Wait, but esters don't have O-H unless it's a hemiacetal or something. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde or something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1: this is a broad region, possibly O-H (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid). But if it's an ester, there would be no O-H. So this suggests that the compound has an O-H group.

Wait, but esters don't have O-H. So if the IR has a peak in 3400–2500, which is O-H, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

But in the NMR, 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which is more likely a carboxylic acid than an alcohol, which would be a broad peak but maybe lower ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton but that's usually around 9-10. So, perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1. Carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers, around 1700. So if the IR shows 1720, that could be an ester. But then where is the O-H?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the data.

Let me list the IR and NMR data again.

IR:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: O-H (stretch)
- 1720 cm-1: carbonyl (likely ester or ketone)
- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: aromatic C=C.

NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs,1H): O-H (carboxylic acid)
- 8.0 ppm (d,2H) and 7.2 ppm (d,2H): aromatic
- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): CH
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to CH
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): terminal CH3.

So the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm), and an ester would not have that proton. So perhaps the IR 1720 is not from an ester but from a ketone. But then the O-H would imply something else.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is from an acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a peak around 1700, but 1720 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe an acyl chloride? No, because then there would be a strong peak around 1800.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, which would absorb at a higher wavenumber. For example, an aromatic ketone may have a higher carbonyl stretch.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the carbonyl is from a ketone, but that would not have an O-H at 10.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. Aldehydes have a proton around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually a triplet or quartet due to coupling with adjacent protons. In this case, it's a broad singlet, which might suggest something else, like an acidic proton.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a phenol. Phenols have O-H protons around 5-7 ppm, but in this case, it's at 10.5, which is higher, so more like a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is correct, that X is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

But then, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which would be higher than a typical carboxylic acid. So maybe it's an acid with an electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the carbonyl stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzoic acid. Wait, but the 1720 is higher than usual, so maybe it's an ester, but then where is the O-H?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider another possibility. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, if X is a nitrile, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the starting material would be an aryl nitrile, perhaps. Alternatively, if X is an ester, the reaction might hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the reaction conditions for ester hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI might not be the same as with aqueous acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But then, what's the structure of X.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alkyne, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: the options are given. Let me check the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, if X is a benzoic acid, what reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles. If X were a nitrile, then the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes the ester to a carboxylic acid. So, if X is a methyl benzoate, the reaction would produce benzoic acid. But in our case, the substituent is more complex.

Wait, perhaps X is a substituted ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. So, for example, X is a phenyl ester, and reacting with HI and red phosphorus would give the corresponding acid.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Maybe nothing, because the acid is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of X.

Wait, another approach: what is the product of the reaction between X and red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. So, the reaction would convert a nitrile group (RCN) into a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). So, if X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So maybe X is the corresponding nitrile, 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Then, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, if X is the nitrile, then the IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1 for the nitrile group. The given IR doesn't show that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis to the acid.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak (like around 1720 and no O-H). But the IR shows O-H, so perhaps the starting material is an ester, but that doesn't make sense because esters don't have O-H.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reevaluate the structure.

If X is a carboxylic acid, then the IR should have a peak around 1700, but here it's 1720. Maybe it's an acid with an electron-withdrawing group, like nitro, which can cause the carbonyl to be higher. But the NMR doesn't show any nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is from a ketone. But then, where's the O-H? If the 10.5 ppm is a ketone, that doesn't make sense because ketones don't have O-H protons.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is from an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So if X has an aldehyde group, the IR would have a peak around 2820-2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the given IR data only mentions 3400-2500 as a broad region. That might fit if there's an aldehyde.

Wait, let me imagine X as a benzaldehyde derivative. So, the IR would have a peak around 1700 for the aldehyde (but wait, aldehydes have a peak around 1700 for the C=O, but the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm). So in the NMR, the aldehyde proton would show up at around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, the 10.5 is a singlet, which could fit.

But then, what about the other NMR signals? Let's see.

If X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, then the other substituents would account for the other signals.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of the possible structures again.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with an alcohol group, but that seems unlikely as esters are typically O-R.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenol ester. For example, methyl salicylate. But in that case, the IR would have a peak for the ester carbonyl and the phenolic O-H. But the NMR would have a peak for the ester OCH3, which is usually around 3.8 ppm. But in the given data, there's nothing around 3.8 ppm except perhaps the 2.9 ppm, which is a CH.

Hmm, I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should consider that the initial analysis of X being a benzoic acid is correct, and the reaction conditions are not for hydrolysis but for something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution. If X has an ester group, maybe the reaction is transesterification, but with HI, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid. So, if X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But looking at the NMR data, if X is an ester, the OCH3 would appear as a triplet around 3.8 ppm, which isn't present here. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the compound X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which might not change it. But that doesn't make sense because the question says it reacts to form a product.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not a hydrolysis but an elimination. Like, if X has a leaving group, perhaps a bromide, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to elimination.

But in that case, X would have a structure with a leaving group, which isn't evident in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction is a reduction. But red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for reductions; maybe for deoxygenation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus can produce an amine. Or wait, no, more likely, it would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

But without the nitrile peak in IR, perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps X is an acid chloride. But then the IR would have a peak around 1800 cm-1, which isn't present. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid with an ester group. But that's not common.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the options are all either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. The reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI.

If X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid. So for example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). But in that case, X would have a nitrile group, implying an IR peak around 2200, which isn't present.

Alternatively, X could be an ester, and the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. So if X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But the NMR of X wouldn't have an OCH3 group, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid, and the reaction doesn't change it. But the question says it reacts, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the reaction conditions. Another possibility is that red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide to form an alkene. So, if X has a vicinal dihalide, the reaction would form an alkene.

But what would X look like in that case? For example, if X is 1,2-dibromo-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, the reaction would eliminate HBr to form 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a double bond. But I don't see any Br in the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bromo-substituted compound.

But again, without more data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. But I don't think that's the usual case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.

Assuming that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), what would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do? Well, perhaps nothing, because it's already a carboxylic acid.

But none of the options are a new product from that reaction. So perhaps I'm wrong about X's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think again about the NMR.

The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which is a CH. Then 1.7 ppm (m,2H) – perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH and to another CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d,3H) – a methyl attached to a CH. 0.9 ppm (t,3H) – a terminal methyl.

So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached via a CH2 to the benzene. So, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a sec-butyl group.

But wait, the substituent is in the para position to the -COOH group.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the case, then X is option C.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolyzing it to the acid. But I don't see the ester groups in the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile that's been misread as a carboxylic acid.

Wait, given all this, perhaps the correct answer is C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But then, what's the product of the reaction?

Wait, if X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, then maybe the reaction doesn't change it. But the question says it 'reacts', so the product must be different.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid. So, the product would be the same as one of the options. But without knowing X's structure, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is a dehydration. So, if X has a hydroxyl group and a leaving group, the reaction could eliminate to form an alkene. But again, I don't see the necessary signals in the NMR.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to conclude.

Based on the NMR and IR data, X seems to be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is unclear, but if the reaction hydrolyzes an ester to an acid, then the product would be the same as option C. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is the same as X. So perhaps X is the product, but that can't be because the question says X reacts to form the product.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying X. Perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester.

If X is an ester, the IR would have a peak at 1720 for the ester carbonyl, and the O-H at 10.5 ppm would suggest a carboxylic acid, which doesn't fit with an ester. So that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. So, X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might convert the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In this case, the product would be option C. So the structure of X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

Looking at the NMR of X:

Protons on the aromatic ring would be similar, but the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. The 10.5 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde, but maybe it's correct.

The substituent's NMR would be as before: 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), 0.9 (CH3).

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the product after hydrolysis (with red phosphorus and HI) would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

That seems to fit. So the answer would be option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A methine (CH) group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A methylene (CH₂) group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Structural Determination:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one position and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)) at the other position. This corresponds to **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter its structure. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectral data and the reaction conditions, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
