Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting transiting planets. I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were already detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, so both have the same mass? Oh, the question says both share the same masses. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits. So no eccentricity complicating things there. The host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but both stars have the same size. Interesting. But their masses are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of the other star.

The goal is to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so that's what the researchers are choosing based on.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else, but I think the bigger factor is the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula:

P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s)) )) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms. Let me think. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by another factor that depends on the orbital distance a. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The probability that an orbiting planet will transit is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a / (R_s))^{-1} ), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ((1) / (something with the orbital distance)), but maybe I should think about the orbital separation.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 times another factor. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the other factor is (1/(a / R_s)) or something else.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, that might be the case. So P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ) )?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a / (R_s + R_p)) )) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let me think geometrically. The probability that the orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_s / a)^2. Because the transit happens only if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The area of the sphere that allows transit is a circle with radius R_s (since the planet has to pass in front of the star), and the total possible area is proportional to a² (since the orbit is a circle with radius a). So the geometric probability is (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, no, wait. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a (semi-major axis). Our line of sight must be within the plane of the orbit. The probability that the orbital plane's inclination is such that it causes a transit is the ratio of the area where the planet
