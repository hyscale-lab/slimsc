Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break down each part of the question step by step.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate? Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a diester, and under basic conditions, it can act as a nucleophile. The other component is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester—so that's the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no, actually, the structure should be CH2=C-O-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the alpha or beta? Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-C(p-Tol)=COOCH3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Or is it the second and third? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with the CH2=CH replaced by CH2-C(p-Tol)=. Wait, no, maybe it's more like CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the beta position of the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH(p-Tol)-COOCH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbons? Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally as:

The acceptor is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. That seems correct. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Maybe the correct structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is attached to C2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let's think about the Michael addition. The nucleophile (dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The beta position is the second carbon from the carbonyl. So in the acceptor, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the carbonyl is at the end. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But wait, the p-tolyl is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2. Then, the carbonyl is on C3. So in this case, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. So when the nucleophile attacks, it's the beta position (the CH2 group), right? No, wait, no. Wait, the alpha carbon is next to the carbonyl, so in this case, the carbonyl is at C3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the alpha position is C2, and the beta would be C1. So the nucleophile would attack C1, which is the beta position.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. The carbonyl is at C3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the alpha is C2 (next to carbonyl), so the beta is C1. So the nucleophile would attack C1, which is the beta position. So dimethyl malonate (which is a diester, (CH3COO)2CH-) would attack here. So when it adds, it would form a new bond between the enolate oxygen and the C1 of the acceptor. So the product would have the malonate's CH2 group connected to the acceptor's C1.

Wait, I think the product would be (CH3COO)2CH-CH2-C(p-Tol)-COOCH3? Or maybe it's a longer chain. Let me think: the acceptor is CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. The nucleophile is (CH3COO)2CH-, which attacks the beta carbon (CH2). So the product would have the CH2-COOEt (from the acrylate) and the CH2-COOEt (from the malonate) connected. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to imagine the structure as:

The malonate has two ester groups on a central carbon, which is attached to the nucleophilic CH- group. So when it attacks, the CH- would add to the beta carbon of the acceptor, which is the CH2 end. So adding the CH- from malonate to the CH2 would give a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, maybe the product would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me think. The product would have three ester groups. The malonate part would contribute two esters, and the acceptor contributes one. So after the Michael addition, the structure would have three ester groups. So the core structure would be a propane with substituents.

Wait, when dimethyl malonate (which is (CH3COO)2CH-) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor, the product would have the structure like (CH3COO)2C-CH2-C(p-Tol)-COOCH3. But that's four carbons, perhaps. Wait, let me count: the acceptor has three carbons (CH2, C(p-Tol), COOCH3), and the malonate adds a CH2 group. So the structure would be CH2 from the malonate attached to the CH2 of the acceptor? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has the structure where the malonate's CH- adds to the acceptor's CH2, making a new carbon chain. So the product would be a tricarboxylate with three ester groups.

Looking at the options, option A for A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That would mean the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(p-Tol)-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The central carbon (C2) is attached to two COOCH3 groups (from the malonate) and a CH2-C(p-Tol)-COOCH3 group. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a six-membered ring or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct product for A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Because the malonate (two COOCH3 on the central carbon) would add to the acceptor, which has a p-tolyl group on the beta position. So the product would have three COOCH3 groups and a p-tolyl group on the second carbon of a propane chain.

Now moving to the second reaction: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH and H3O+ to form B.

Wait, wait, the reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions are MeOH and H3O+. Hmm, this sounds like a conjugate addition, perhaps a Michael addition as well.

Wait, but wait: (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN, with E geometry. But wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN, but E geometry would have the CH2 and CN groups on opposite sides. Wait, but that's a terminal alkyne, but here it's an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. So that's our Michael acceptor.

The nucleophile is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the piperidine ring has a cyclohexene substituent at position 1. So the structure is a piperidine ring where one of the nitrogen's substituents is a cyclohexene ring. So the nitrogen is attached to a cyclohexene group.

Wait, but piperidine is a six-membered amine ring. So 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would have the cyclohexene ring attached to the nitrogen. So the nitrogen is connected to the cyclohexene's carbon 1.

Now, the reaction is under acidic conditions (H3O+ and MeOH). So perhaps the piperidine is protonated, making it a good nucleophile. The Michael addition would involve the nucleophilic piperidine attacking the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, but wait: the acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-CN. So the alpha and beta positions are CH2 and CH, respectively. The beta carbon is the CH group.

So the nucleophile (piperidine's nitrogen) would attack the beta carbon (CH). Then, the product would have the piperidine attached to the CH group, which was previously part of the double bond.

So the product would be a secondary amine attached to the CH2-CN group. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. The cyclohexene is a conjugated diene, so under acidic conditions, perhaps it undergoes some ring-opening or acts as a nucleophile? Or maybe the cyclohexene is just a substituent on the piperidine.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene part isn't directly involved in the reaction. The piperidine's nitrogen is a good nucleophile because under acidic conditions, it gets protonated, making it more positively charged and thus more nucleophilic.

So the attack would be on the beta carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. So the product would be CH2-CH-(N-substituent)-CN. Wait, but the piperidine is a cyclic amine, so the substituent would be the cyclohexene-piperidine group.

So the product would be CH2-CH-(N-cyclohexene-piperidine)-CN. Wait, but the structure might be more like (CH2)2NCN? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. But I'm not sure.

Looking at option A for B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would imply a butanenitrile with a substituent on C3, which is a cyclohexyl group with a ketone (oxo) at position 2.

Wait, but the starting piperidine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl). After reaction, perhaps the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane with a ketone. Because under acidic conditions, the cyclohexene might undergo some ring-opening or oxidation? Or perhaps the ring remains but the substituent changes.

Alternatively, maybe the piperidine's substituent is a cyclohexene, which upon reaction forms a cyclohexane ring with a ketone. Wait, perhaps when the Michael addition occurs, the cyclohexene ring is opened or a new ring is formed. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary amine attached to a CH2-CN group, but I'm not certain. Looking at the options, option A says B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(cyclohexyl ketone)-CN. Hmm, perhaps the nucleophilic attack leads to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and the cyclohexene part becomes a cyclohexanone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about the mechanism. The piperidine's nitrogen attacks the beta carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The attack would break the double bond, the nitrile remains, and the substituent from the piperidine is added.

Since the starting piperidine has a cyclohexene substituent, perhaps after the attack, the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexyl group with a ketone, making it a cyclohexanone. So the product would be a butanenitrile with a cyclohexanone substituent on the third carbon. So that would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Now, moving to the third reaction: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane ring has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3 (so it's 3-oxobutyl).

The starting materials are C and but-3-en-2-one. The conditions are KOH and H2O, which suggests a Michael addition or perhaps an aldol condensation. But given the product, it's more likely a conjugate addition.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=O, but more accurately, it's CH2=C(CO)CH2. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2CO with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Butene is four carbons. But-3-en-2-one would be: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-CO, but that can't be. Let me think: but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C-CH2-CO. Wait, no, but but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
CH2-C-CH2-CH2?

Wait, wait, but-3-en-2-one is:

Position 1: CH3-
Position 2: C=O
Position 3: double bond
So, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-CO-CH3? No, wait, but that's buta-1,3-dien-2-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one: the longest chain is four carbons, with a ketone at C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that doesn't make sense because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=C-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
CH2-C-CH2-CH2-

But that's four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that would require a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is structured as (CH2)2-CO-CH2. Wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CO with a double bond starting at C3. But I'm not sure.

In any case, but-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So it's an enone. The reaction is under basic conditions (KOH, H2O), so it's likely a Michael addition. So the nucleophile C would attack the beta carbon of the enone.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane ring has two ketone groups at 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group. The 3-oxobutyl group is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, 3-oxobutyl would be CH2-CH2-CO-, which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3. Wait, but butyl is four carbons, so 3-oxobutyl would be (CH2)2CO-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. But that's butanoyl, not 3-oxobutyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3-oxobutyl group is CH2-CHO-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So in the substituent, the third carbon is a ketone. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but butyl is four, so maybe the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CO)CH2-CH3. Wait, that would imply a four-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon. But I'm not entirely sure.

In any case, the reaction involves the nucleophile C adding to the enone but-3-en-2-one. The product is a cyclohexane dione with a substituent. So C must be a compound that can perform a Michael addition.

Looking at the product, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione suggests that the starting material C is a cyclohexane derivative that, upon addition, becomes a dione. So perhaps C is a cyclohexanone that, after the reaction, gains another ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is C + but-3-en-2-one → product.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane ring has two ketone groups (1 and 3) and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So perhaps C is a cyclohexanone, which upon attack by the enone (but-3-en-2-one) adds another ketone.

Wait, perhaps C is cyclohexanone, which, under basic conditions, forms an enolate. The enolate then attacks the enone.

Wait, but in that case, the product would have the cyclohexanone ring with an additional substituent. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a dienolate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so two ketone groups. So perhaps the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione itself. But that's the product, so perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyclohexanone, and the reaction adds another ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material C is a cyclohexyl group with a leaving group that upon attack forms the dione.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3, attached to the cyclohexane dione at position 2.

So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, perhaps. So the substituent is butanoyl, but with a ketone at the third position, but I'm not entirely clear.

In the reaction, the nucleophile (C) attacks the enone but-3-en-2-one. So C is likely a compound with a nucleophilic site, perhaps an enolate or a Grignard reagent.

Wait, but the conditions are KOH and H2O, so likely a base-induced enolate formation. So C could be a ketone that forms an enolate, which then attacks the enone.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexane dione, so perhaps the starting material C is cyclohexanone, and the reaction adds another ketone group. Alternatively, perhaps C is a dienolate.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but that's the product, so that can't be.

Wait, another approach: the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group, which is -CH2-CH2-CO-? But butyl is four carbons, so maybe it's CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, but that would be pentanoyl, not butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CO)-CH2-CH3? No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a conjugate addition, where the enolate of C attacks the enone.

So if C is cyclohexanone, its enolate would attack the enone but-3-en-2-one. Wait, but the product is a cyclohexane dione, which suggests that the enolate is adding to the enone, which would bring in another carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the enolate adds to the enone, and the oxygen from the enolate becomes part of the new structure, leading to the formation of two ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the starting material C is cyclohexanone, and the enolate attacks the enone, leading to a new ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting very far. Let me look at the options to see what C could be. The options for C are either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione or cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at option B, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So if the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione and the reaction adds a substituent.

But wait, in the reaction, C is a reactant, so if the product has a substituent, C must have provided that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an aldol addition. Under basic conditions, C forms an enolate, which attacks the enone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the enolate of C to the enone but-3-en-2-one. The product then would have the substituent from the enolate attached to the alpha position of the enone, leading to a new ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the product. The product has two ketones on the cyclohexane ring and a substituent with a ketone. So the reaction might involve adding a ketone.

Wait, perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the reaction is adding a substituent to it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of the dione attacks the enone, adding a substituent to the dione.

Wait, but in that case, the product would have an additional substituent on the dione. But in the product, the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group. So perhaps the enolate of the dione attacks the enone, bringing in the substituent.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but moving forward, I think option B for C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would make sense if the reaction forms a dione.

But I'm not entirely confident. Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option B: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, so in the third reaction, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So C is a reactant, and but-3-en-2-one is another. The product has the cyclohexane dione, so perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Hmm, but if that's the case, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would fit.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, where C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would make the product correct.

So, putting it all together, let's see the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the third reaction in option B has C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which in the product becomes 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That would make sense if the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of C (cyclohexane-1,3-dione) attacks the enone but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but wait: C is a reactant, so if the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then perhaps C is a cyclohexanone that adds another group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material C is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the reaction adds a substituent to it, leading to a longer chain.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should go with what makes the most sense. For the first reaction, I think the product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. For the second reaction, the product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. And for the third reaction, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option B has these as A and B and C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So option B seems correct.


The problem involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct reactants and products from the given options. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Reaction 1:  
**Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.  
**Analysis:**  
- Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate).  
- The product is a resonance-stabilized intermediate, specifically a tricarboxylate ester.  
- The structure of the product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, as the p-tolyl group is attached to the second carbon of the propane chain.  

---

### Reaction 2:  
**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H₃O⁺.  
**Analysis:**  
- The piperidine derivative acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).  
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexanone (due to the reaction conditions), and the nitrile remains intact.  

---

### Reaction 3:  
**Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H₂O.  
**Analysis:**  
- The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which indicates that the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.  
- Under basic conditions, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione reacts with the α-β unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one), leading to the addition of a 3-oxobutyl group at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring.  

---

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product.  
- **Option B:** Correct because it lists A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, all of which match the expected products.  
- **Option C:** Incorrect because it lists A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which does not match the product.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product.  

---

**Final Answer:**  
The correct option is **B**, as it accurately identifies the reactants and products for all three reactions.  

**Answer: B**
