Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different power law. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

Wait, parallax formula: plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So as distance d increases, plx decreases. But how does that help with the number of stars per unit parallax?

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same in all directions. But wait, wait. Uniformly distributed in space would imply that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. But the way we observe them depends on distance.

So, I think it's about how the volume changes as a function of distance. Because when you look at stars at different distances, the volume of space you're considering expands with the cube of the radius. Oh right! Volume scales with r^3, so the number of stars would depend on that.

But wait, the question is about stars per unit range of parallax, so I need to relate parallax to distance and then to volume.

Let me think in terms of a differential. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πd² dr) multiplied by the number density (n, which is constant because uniform). So, the number N is n * 4π d² dr.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that in. So dr = derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that. d = 1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). Hmm, but since we're dealing with positive ranges, perhaps I can express dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by (d/(d plx)) dplx. So, d = 1/plx. So, dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since d is positive, and plx is positive, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the purpose of counting stars, perhaps I can take the magnitude.

So, dr = (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting back into the number N: N = n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (dplx / plx²) )

Wait, wait, let me be careful. The thin shell is at distance d, thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would be N = n * 4π d² dr. But since dr is related to dplx, I need to express dr in terms of dplx.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx. So, for each plx, I want the number of stars in that small range.

So, the distance d is 1/plx. The shell at distance d has thickness dr, which corresponds to a change in plx of dplx. So, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So, when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd = - (d²) dplx. Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that's perhaps correct. So, dr = |dd| = (d²) dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dr = (1/(plx)^2) dplx.

Putting this together, the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dr. Substituting d=1/plx and dr=(1/plx^2) dplx:

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So per unit change in plx, the number is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of plx." So, for each change in plx (dplx), how many stars are there. So N = (n * 4π / plx^4 ) dplx. So the count per unit dplx is n *4π / plx^4.

Hmm, but wait, this seems different from what I thought. Because the number of stars in a given shell (at distance d) depends on d^2, but when you express it in terms of plx, you get higher exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume in plx space? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of the distribution in terms of volume. The number of stars within a certain parallax range. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So for stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx, their distances are between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx and dd = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx.

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Let me think in terms of flux. No, perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of stars at a given distance is proportional to the surface area at that distance, which is 4π d². But as the distance increases, the same number of stars per unit volume implies that the number of stars in a shell (the thin layer between d and d+dr) is proportional to d² dr.

But when you express this in terms of parallax, since d is 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx² and dr = (1/plx²) dplx (as before). So the number of stars in a parallax range dplx is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx → 1/plx^4 dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx⁴). So the count would increase as plx decreases because more stars are at larger distances.

Wait, but wait a moment. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is uniform. So in each shell, the number of stars is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr² dr.

But if we convert this into parallax, which is 1/r, the number of stars per unit parallax should consider how the volume element changes with parallax.

Another way to think: the differential number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is dN = n * 4π r² dr, where n is number density (stars per volume).

But since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into dN: dN = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx → n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, dN/dplx = n *4π / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx increases as plx decreases, which makes sense because closer stars (higher plx) are in a smaller volume shell, so fewer. As we go to lower plx (farther away), the shell's volume increases, hence more stars.

So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~ 1/plx^3

So in this case, the answer should be option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes in these problems, the answer might be something else. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reasoning again.

Imagine you have a fixed number of stars in a certain volume. As you go to larger distances (smaller plx), the volume of the shell you're considering increases. So the number of stars in each shell would increase, but since the shell's thickness in plx increases, the change depends on how plx relates to the volume.

Wait, no. Because as you go to larger plx (which is closer, since plx is higher), the number of stars in each shell decreases. For example, nearby stars (high plx) are in a small shell, so fewer stars. Far away (low plx), more stars in each shell.

Wait, but when you take a small range of plx (like dplx), how many stars are in that range? The number depends on the volume at that distance.

So in terms of plx, the volume element is dV = 4π r² dr. Since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * dV, which is n * 4π / plx^4 dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is about the number per unit of plx, regardless of the shell's volume. Hmm, I don't think so. Because the number of stars in a given range of plx would depend on how many stars are at that distance, which is determined by the volume element.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake with the substitution. Let me redo the substitution carefully.

We have:

dN = n * 4π r² dr.

r = 1/plx.

dr = derivative of r w.r. to plx. So dr/dplx = d (1/plx)/d plx = -1/(plx²).

Thus, dr = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into dN: dN = n *4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

But since we're dealing with positive values, we can take absolute value, so dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Thus, dN = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = n*4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, yes, that's correct. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4) → option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star in parsecs. For a thin shell of stars at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dr\), the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\(4\pi d^2\)) multiplied by the number density of stars (\(n\)):

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dr.
\]

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\) (taking the magnitude for simplicity). Substituting these into the equation for \(dN\), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(d\text{plx}\)) is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\). This means that as parallax decreases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit range of parallax increases, consistent with the fact that larger volumes of space contribute more stars.

From the given options:

- **A) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^4\):** Correct, as derived above.
- **B) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^2\):** Incorrect, does not match the derived relationship.
- **C) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^1\):** Incorrect, does not match the derived relationship.
- **D) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^3\):** Incorrect, does not match the derived relationship.

The correct answer is therefore:

**Answer: A**
