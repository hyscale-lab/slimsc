Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function should be a complex function, right? Because it's common to have an imaginary part. But when we measure the position, the probability depends on the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the presence of the imaginary unit 'i' here might complicate things a bit, but I think the approach is similar.

The key point is that when we measure the position of the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Or wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero; the probability of finding the particle is zero outside 1 and 3. So the wave function's square must have zero probability there. So the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, but inside, it's non-zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's the function itself. But if the particle isn't found outside 1 and 3, that suggests that the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3, right? Because the wave function must be continuous, and the boundary conditions might require that. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a function that's defined for x >= -1, I think. Because sqrt(1+x) would be real only when x >= -1. But the measurements are only between x=1 and x=3, so maybe it's the case that the wave function must be zero outside this region, implying that the function inside is non-zero only between 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, another thought: the wave function must satisfy certain boundary conditions. For a particle in a box scenario, the wave function is zero at the boundaries. But this setup isn't exactly a particle in a box because the potential isn't necessarily infinite outside the region. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3. But looking at the given wave function, (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, when x=1, it becomes a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. That's not zero unless a is sqrt(2)*0.5i, but that would make a a complex number, which I don't think is the case here. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as a normalized function, and the square of its absolute value must integrate to 1 between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. Because when you measure the position, you find the particle only between 1 and 3, so the wave function outside must be zero. So maybe the given function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is a piecewise function: (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that would be the part of the wave function between x=1 and x=3. So the entire wave function is zero outside that interval, but inside, it's this complex function. So the normalization condition would be the integral of |psi(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So to find 'a', we need to normalize the wave function. The normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i|² dx equals 1.

Let's compute |psi(x)|². Since psi(x) is a complex number, its absolute square is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So, real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5. So |psi(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral step by step.

First, break it into two integrals:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute the first integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Let u = 1 + x, du = dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So, integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from 2 to 4. The integral of 1/u is ln(u).

So first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) approximately: ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the wave function's modulus squared is (a^2/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

So the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1, leading to a^2 = (0.5)/ln(2), so a≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, so 0.85 is the closest option. Looking back at the options, option B is 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The problem states that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), meaning the wave function must be normalized within this interval. The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

### First Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)
Let \( u = 1+x \), so \( du = dx \). When \( x = 1 \), \( u = 2 \), and when \( x = 3 \), \( u = 4 \). The integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = a^2 \left[\ln(u)\right]_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)
This is straightforward:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which matches option **B**.
