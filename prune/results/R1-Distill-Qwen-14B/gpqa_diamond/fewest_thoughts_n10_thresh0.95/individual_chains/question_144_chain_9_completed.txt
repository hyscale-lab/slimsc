Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

Wait, so mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay have a mean lifetime, and from that, you can calculate how far they travel before decaying. The formula for the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and Γ is the decay width. Then, the mean distance L would be the speed v multiplied by τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I get v? I think for particles moving relativistically, we can use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. Oh right, the energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV, but I need to make sure about the units. Let me see, E is in GeV, mass is in GeV/c², and the width is in MeV, so I need to convert everything consistently.

Wait, the natural units where c=1 and ħ=1 are often used in particle physics, but I might need to convert them back to meters and seconds. Hmm, perhaps I can proceed using natural units first and then convert at the end.

So, let's compute the momentum p. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, so E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let me solve for p.

E_X^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2
(8)^2 = (p)^2 c^2 + (1.2)^2 c^4

Wait, but since E is 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV, but I think in natural units where c=1, E is in GeV, p is in GeV/c, and mass is in GeV/c². Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of E, m, and use the relation to find beta (v/c) and gamma (Lorentz factor).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the velocity beta. The velocity can be found using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Wait, but when using natural units, that's beta = sqrt(1 - m²/E²). Since E is much larger than m, beta will be close to 1.

Let's compute that. E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So m^2/E^2 is (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v is 0.9887c.

Wait, but for more precise calculations, perhaps I should use exact values. Alternatively, maybe the velocity is close enough to c that we can approximate v as c. But for the sake of accuracy, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

But let me first calculate the exact value. beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887 when square-rooted. So beta is about 0.9887 c.

So the velocity is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using exact terms without approximation. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the exact calculation isn't necessary because the options are precise enough.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me make sure about the units. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Because ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.

Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but wait, is the decay width Γ already the total width, which is the same as the total decay rate? Yes, because Γ is the total width, which is the sum of partial widths, and it's the same as the decay rate. So τ is indeed ħ / Γ.

Then, the mean decay distance L = v * τ. So v is about 0.9887c, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875 ) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute that. 2.966 * 2 is 5.932. 2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ approximately 0.1689. So total approx 6.1009. So 6.1009e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, the options are around 4.0655e-15 or 5e-15, etc.

Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the numbers carefully.

First, compute τ: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = ?

Calculating 6.582 ÷ 0.32. 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 20.56875 times 0.32 is 6.582. Because 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 0.56875=0.181999999... So total 6.4+0.181999=6.581999, which is approximately 6.582.

So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau is 20.56875 * 1e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, v = beta c = sqrt(1 - m²/E²) * c.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.

m²/E² = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as before.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute the product: 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Let me compute 2.9661 * 2.056875:

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322
2.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ let's compute that. 0.05 * 2.9661 = 0.148305. 0.006875 * 2.9661 ≈ 0.020299. So total approx 0.148305 + 0.020299 = 0.168604.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.168604 = 6.100804.

So L ≈ 6.1008e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have a 6e-16. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation is giving about 6.1e-16, but the options are all lower. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the units.

Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV. I converted it to GeV as 0.32 GeV. That's correct.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So units are correct in E² = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4.

Wait, but when using natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E and m are in same units. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have used the speed as v = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / E. Wait, which is another way to compute beta.

Alternatively, velocity can be found as v = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (E) * c.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact expressions.

Let me compute gamma (Lorentz factor) first. Gamma is E/(m c^2). Wait, but in our units, c=1, so gamma = E / m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2)^2 )/(8^2) ) = same as before, sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So that's consistent. So v is about 0.9887c.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the decay width is given as total width, but perhaps in some other terms. Alternatively, perhaps the mean lifetime is not τ = ħ/(Γ), but I think that is correct.

Wait, another thought: since X is a resonance, perhaps the lifetime is related to the width via τ = ħ/(Γ). I think that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the decay length formula is different. Maybe I should consider the particle's proper lifetime (tau) and then multiply by gamma to get the dilated lifetime. Oh wait, no. Because tau is the proper time, the lifetime measured in the rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the mean decay distance is v * gamma * tau.

Wait a minute! Oh, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I used L = v * tau, but tau is the proper lifetime (rest frame). So the moving frame's lifetime is gamma * tau. So the correct formula is L = v * gamma * tau (proper tau).

Wait no, wait, let me clarify. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. Because in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau. But due to time dilation, the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. So the mean decay distance is L = v * (gamma * tau).

Hmm, that changes things. Because earlier I used L = v * tau, but I should have used gamma * tau. So let me recalculate.

So, tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma (Lorentz factor) is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute that: 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, 6.666666 * 2.056875 = let's compute that:

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125, and 2.056875 * 0.666666 ≈ 1.37125. So total is approximately 13.7125.

So the lab frame lifetime is approximately 13.7125e-24 s.

So the mean decay length L is v * (gamma * tau) = v * (gamma tau).

Wait, but v is 0.9887c, and gamma is 6.666666... So perhaps another approach is to compute L = beta c * gamma * tau.

Beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s.

So beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, gamma is 6.666666, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 13.7125e-24 s.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

L = (2.9661e8 m/s) * 13.7125e-24 s.

Multiply those together: 2.9661e8 * 13.7125e-24 = (2.9661 * 13.7125) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.9661 *13.7125.

Let me do that: 2.9661 *13 = 38.5593, 2.9661 * 0.7125 ≈ approx 2.112. So total approx 38.5593 + 2.112 = 40.6713.

So L ≈ 40.6713e-16 meters, which is 4.06713e-15 meters.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters. Now looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So our calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation for gamma * tau.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.666666666666667.

Tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 * 1e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.

So gamma tau =13.7125e-24 s.

Now, beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)).

E=8, m=1.2. So m^2/E^2 = 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.

But let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator:

√0.9775.

Let me compute it precisely.

Let me think, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

0.98^2=0.9604, 2*0.98*0.0087=0.0172, (0.0087)^2≈0.00007569. So total 0.9604 + 0.0172=0.9776 + 0.00007569 ≈0.97767569. So 0.9887^2 ≈0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps a more precise beta is a little lower.

Alternatively, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

We can use linear approximation. Let me find x such that x² = 0.9775.

Let me take x0 = 0.9887, x0² = 0.97767569.

The actual value is 0.9775, which is 0.9775 = x0² - 0.00017569.

We can approximate dx ≈ (delta_x) = (delta_y)/(2x0), where delta_y is -0.00017569.

So delta_x ≈ (-0.00017569) / (2 * 0.9887) ≈ (-0.00017569)/(1.9774) ≈ approx -8.886e-5.

So x ≈ x0 + delta_x = 0.9887 - 0.00008886 ≈ 0.98861114.

So beta ≈ 0.98861114.

So now, beta c = 0.98861114 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96583e8 m/s.

Now, L = beta c * gamma tau.

beta c = 2.96583e8 m/s.

gamma tau = 13.7125e-24 s.

Multiply them: 2.96583e8 * 13.7125e-24 = (2.96583 * 13.7125) ) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.96583 *13.7125.

Let me compute this accurately.

13.7125 * 2.96583.

13 * 2.96583 = 38.55579.

0.7125 * 2.96583 = ?

0.7 * 2.96583 = 2.07608.

0.0125 * 2.96583 = 0.037072875.

Total 2.07608 + 0.037072875 = 2.11315.

So total 38.55579 + 2.11315 = 40.66894.

So 40.66894e-16 meters, which is 4.066894e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.0669e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. The slight discrepancy comes from the approximation in beta. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

### Key Information:
- **Production energy**: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Mass**: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Decay width**: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Formula for Mean Decay Distance:
The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau \cdot \gamma
\]
where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the particle,
- \( \tau \) is the proper mean lifetime,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

#### Step 1: Proper Mean Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper mean lifetime is related to the decay width by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

#### Step 2: Velocity (\( v \))
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
v = \beta c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \cdot c
\]
Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2} = \frac{1.44}{64} = 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2} = 0.9775
\]
\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887, \quad v = 0.9887 \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

#### Step 3: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

#### Step 4: Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau \cdot \gamma
\]
Substituting \( v = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.6667
\]
First, calculate \( \tau \cdot \gamma \):
\[
\tau \cdot \gamma = (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.6667 \approx 13.7125 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]
Then, calculate \( L \):
\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (13.7125 \times 10^{-24}) = (2.9661 \cdot 13.7125) \times 10^{-16}
\]
\[
2.9661 \cdot 13.7125 \approx 40.6689, \quad L \approx 40.6689 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.06689 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.06689 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
