Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main differences are in the observed Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. So maybe the RV method measures the star's velocity, and the amplitude of that velocity (the semi-amplitude) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P) )^(1/3) )) but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, which is about the Sun's mass, M_p can be neglected. So K ≈ (G * M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) )^(1/ something? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ (something)) ) / (P^(1/3)) ). Hmm, I might be mixing up the exponents.

Wait, I think the correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * 2π )) )^(1/3? No, maybe I should look up the formula. Wait, no, I can't. I have to think.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the dependence on the period and the semi-amplitude. Since both stars have the same mass, M_star is same for both. The planet masses are same as Neptune, so M_p is same. So the semi-amplitude K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because if P increases, K decreases.

So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Or, K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (same constant) / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Therefore, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So solving for P2/P1, we cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, no, let me double-check that. Let me rearrange the equation:

K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3)

Dividing K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ) )

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

But the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So it's P2 / P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K1/K2 is 5/7.

So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. But the question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So it's less than 1. So 0.36 times, which would mean planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem states that the shift for planet #1 is 5, and for #2, it's 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, but K is the semi-amplitude. So if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that planet #2's effect on its star is more. So that could be because of a more massive planet, a shorter orbital period, or a closer orbit (smaller semi-major axis). But in this case, the planet masses are the same. So the larger K comes from either shorter period or smaller semi-major axis.

But the orbital period is determined by the semi-major axis and the mass of the star via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to (a³)/(M_star). So if P is longer, a is larger.

But in RV method, the semi-amplitude K depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

Let me try to get back to the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ something) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)).

Wait, I think I might have to think of the formula correctly. Let me think:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to use the formula as:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ]^(something) ) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/ (something)) ) / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should think about the dependence.

Because both stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write it as K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = k / P1^(1/3)
K2 = k / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (k / P1^(1/3)) ) / (k / P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides.

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

(5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 0.364.

Which means, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. That would be P2/P1 = ~0.36, so it's 0.36 times as long. So planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the options are given as options for how many times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer, meaning planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the spectral line shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet mass and stellar mass. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets with the same stellar and planetary masses, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Cubing this ratio gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about \( 0.36 \) times as long as that of planet #1.

From the options provided, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
