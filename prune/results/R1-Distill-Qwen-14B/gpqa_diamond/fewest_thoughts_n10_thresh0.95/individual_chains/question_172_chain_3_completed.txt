Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. When a star is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy levels because there's more thermal energy.

Wait, this must have something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor explains the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i is the number of particles in state i, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote this delta E as ΔE. So ΔE = E_i - E_j. For the problem, the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. So for the specific energy level, the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Or wait, wait, wait. Are they comparing the same energy levels? Or is it the higher level? Oh, I think the question says that the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J, so that's fixed.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So, I think that the number of atoms in a certain excited state (say level i) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, in the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two states is n_i/n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But wait, if we're considering the same transition for both stars, then E_i and E_j are the same for both stars. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) would be determined by their respective temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to set up the ratio for each star relative to a common lower energy level. Let me think: For each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n_i) to the ground state atoms (n_j) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star 1: n1 (excited) = (some function of T1)
Star 2: n2 (excited) = (some function of T2)
And n1 = 2 * n2.

Let me write it more precisely. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1_i / n1_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2, (n2_i / n2_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But in this problem, the excited state is the same for both, so maybe the ratio for each star is relative to the ground state, but the problem gives the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think n1_i (excited) = 2 * n2_i (excited). But wait, T is different, so the ratio would depend on the temperatures.

Wait, but each star has its own distribution. So for each star, the ratio of n_i to n_j is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is that star's temperature.

So for star 1: n1_i/n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star 2: n2_i/n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says n1_i = 2 * n2_i. Hmm, but wait, that's only if n1_j and n2_j are being compared. Wait, maybe not. Because the total number of atoms is different, but in the photosphere, the density might be similar. But perhaps it's comparing the same lower state, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio between the two stars' excited states is 2:1. So n1_i / n2_i = 2. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for that same energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But each star's number of excited atoms depends on their own temperature. So perhaps the ratio (n1_i / n2_i) = 2 = [ (exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) / (exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) ].

Wait, because n_i for each star is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), assuming that their lower states are the same, which I think they are considering the same transition. So n_i for star 1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So the ratio n1_i / n2_i = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But n1_i / n2_i = 2. So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, 1/T2 minus 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting that in:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k) ] * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting. So let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K^{-1} ?

Wait, that's nice because the ΔE/k will be 1. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [1] * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that matches. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The stellar photospheres are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann factor relates the population of atoms in different energy states to temperature as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the states, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of the excited state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( n_{1,i} = 2 n_{2,i} \), so the ratio of the excited state populations between the two stars is:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{2,i}} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors for each star:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{2,i}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Simplifying the term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting this back into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.**

Answer: D
