--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So, the key here is to understand how the temperature affects the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in thermal equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of particles in two levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). So, the ratio goes down. Let me think why that happens.

The ratio (n2/n1) depends exponentially on the energy difference divided by kT. If the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(... ) becomes smaller. So, (n2/n1) would decrease if the lower energy level is more populated, assuming E2 > E1. Or wait, if E2 is higher than E1, then when T increases, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio increases. So, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So in this case, when the star has spots, T is lower, so the ratio (n2/n1) is lower.

The question is, what's the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K). So, we need to calculate (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, no. The problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, without spots (higher T), the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots). So, we need to compute [ (n2/n1)_6000 ] / [ (n2/n1)_5500 ].

But wait, looking at the ratio, (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), assuming g1 and g2 are the same or their ratio is constant. Oh wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So, the statistical weights might be part of the ratio. But I think the problem tells us to assume the photosphere is in LTE, so we can proceed with the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but also, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the near ultraviolet or maybe the vacuum ultraviolet. Not sure if that's relevant, but perhaps it's just giving information about the energy difference between the levels. Let me see, the energy difference can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ. Since hc is a constant, and λ is given, maybe we can find (E2 - E1) in terms of kT.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to work with the ratio of the ratios. Let's denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1. Then, the ratio of n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So, the ratio when there are no spots is R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K. When there are spots, T2 is 5500 K, so R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). The factor we're looking for is R1/R2.

So, R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, let me compute that exponent correctly: exponent is [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1).

So, the factor is exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, but I don't know ΔE. But wait, we can compute it from the wavelength. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength λ, the energy difference is ΔE = hc/λ.

So, ΔE = hc/(λ), where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is 1448 Å. Let me compute hc/(λ) in terms of k*T.

Wait, but let me express everything in terms of k*T. Let me calculate ΔE/(k*T) for each temperature.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio (T1 / T2). Let me calculate that.

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Wait, but I think I can calculate the ratio of (n2/n1) for each T, then take the ratio.

So, let me denote the ratio as R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Assuming g2/g1 is the same for both cases, the ratio R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, but I can compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, 1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 K^-1

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4) = 0.151e-4 K^-1 = 1.51e-5 K^-1

So, the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) * (1.51e-5) [K^-1]

Now, ΔE is hc/λ. Let me compute hc/(λ) in units of k*T.

Wait, let's compute hc/(k T) for each temperature, but perhaps it's easier to compute ΔE/(k) and then multiply by (1.51e-5 K^-1), then the exponent becomes (ΔE/(k)) * 1.51e-5.

Wait, but wait, not quite. Let me think again.

Wait, the exponent is [ (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Which is (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Hmm, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, since the energy difference is given by the wavelength, let's compute the value of hc/(λ).

Let me compute hc/(λ) in terms of k*T_sun or something, but perhaps better to compute it in terms of k*T for the two temperatures.

Wait, let me compute the value of hc/(λ) in units of eV, since I can then compare it to k*T in eV.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Multiply by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 * 1.448e-7 = approx 2.873e-32 J

Now, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so hc/(λ) in eV is 2.873e-32 / (1.602e-19) ≈ 1.793e-13 eV.

Wait, that seems really small. Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, wait, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters? No, wait, 1e-10 meters per Ångström. So 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters. Oh, right, so 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. So, that's correct.

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Multiply by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 * 1.448e-7 = 1.9878 * 1.448 = approx 2.873e-32 J m^2.

Wait, wait, no, hc is in J m, and λ is in meters, so hc/λ would be in J.

Hmm, 2.873e-32 J. Now, converting to eV: 2.873e-32 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 1.793e-13 eV.

Wait, that's a very small number. That can't be right because if the energy difference is so small, then the ratio would be almost the same. But the problem states that the ratio changes by a factor of around 7.8 or something else, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recalculate hc.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Then, hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 J m / 1.448e-7 m = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * (1e-25 / 1e-7) ) = approx 1.373 * 1e-18 = 1.373e-18 J.

Converting to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Oh wait, that's better. So, the energy difference ΔE is 8.57 eV. That makes more sense.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7.

So, 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. So, 1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.373. So, 1.373e-18 J. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 1.373e-18 J is equal to 1.373e-18 / (1.602e-19) eV = approximately 8.57 eV.

So, ΔE = 8.57 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, k*T for T1 (6000 K) is 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K = 0.517 eV.

Similarly, k*T for T2 (5500 K) is 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So, ΔE/(k*T1) = 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58.

ΔE/(k*T2) = 8.57 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.09.

So, the ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so for T1 = 6000 K, it's exp(-16.58), and for T2=5500 K, it's exp(-18.09).

Wait, but that can't be right. Because exp(-16.58) is a very small number. Wait, but wait, if ΔE is 8.57 eV, then for T=6000 K, kT is about 0.517 eV, so 8.57 / 0.517 is about 16.58. So, the exponent is about -16.58.

Wait, but for a transition to occur, the photon's energy must be sufficient to cause the transition. So, perhaps I should have considered the transition in the opposite direction. Wait, no, the ratio is about the number in higher versus lower energy levels. If the energy level is higher, then higher temperatures would populate it more because the thermal energy is higher. So, at higher T, the ratio n2/n1 would be higher.

Wait, but in this case, when the spots are present, the temperature is lower, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So, when the star is spotless (higher T), the ratio is higher.

But the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Suppose level 2 is higher than level 1. So, to go from level 1 to level 2, you need energy. The Boltzmann factor says that the population of higher energy levels is lower when temperature is lower.

So, for higher T, n2/n1 increases. So, when the star has no spots (T=6000), n2/n1 is higher than when it has spots (T=5500).

So, the ratio R1 (no spots) is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 (spots) is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but wait, no. Because the Boltzmann factor is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so E2-E1 is positive. So, (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is positive.

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so (n2/n1) increases.

So, R1 (no spots) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 (spots) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, the ratio R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, because:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So, the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, but 1/T2 is 1/5500 and 1/T1 is 1/6000.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive (since 1/5500 > 1/6000). So, the exponent is positive, so the factor is greater than 1. Which makes sense because R1 is larger than R2.

So, let's compute the exponent.

We have ΔE = 8.57 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's see, 8.57 / 8.617e-5.

Wait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5 * 1.0 (since 8.57/8.617 is about 0.994) → ~1e5.

Wait, 8.57 / 0.00008617 → Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 8.57 / 0.00008617:

Let me compute 8.57 / 0.00008617 → 8.57 * (1 / 0.00008617) → 8.57 * 11605. So, 8.57 * 11605 ≈ let's compute:

10,000 → 85,700.

1,605 → 8.57 * 1605 ≈ 8.57 * 1000 = 8570, 8.57 * 605 ≈ 5193. So, 8570 +5193=13,763.

Total approx 85,700 +13,763 = 99,463 K.

Wait, that's a lot. So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,463 K.

Now, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Compute this:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1.

So, the exponent is (99463 K) * (0.000015151 K^-1) ≈ 99463 * 0.000015151.

Compute 99463 * 0.000015151:

Let me compute 100,000 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

Subtract 537 * 0.000015151: 537 is approx 0.537% of 100,000.

Wait, 537 * 0.000015151 ≈ 0.00813.

So, 1.5151 - 0.00813 ≈ 1.50697.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So, the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, but 1.507 is a bit more than 1.5, so let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

e^1.507 ≈ e^(1.5) * e^(0.007)

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.007 ≈ 1.00705.

So, 4.4817 * 1.00705 ≈ approximately 4.51.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1.507 is a bit over 1.5, so e^1.507 is about 4.51 or so.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using Taylor series, e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6.

x=1.507.

But that's a big x, so maybe better to compute e^1.5 * e^0.007.

As above, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.007 is approximately 1 + 0.007 + 0.007^2/2 + 0.007^3/6 ≈ 1.007 + 0.0000245 + 0.000000343 ≈ ~1.0070248.

So, 4.4817 * 1.0070248 ≈ let's compute:

4.4817 * 1.007 = 4.4817 + 4.4817 * 0.007.

4.4817 * 0.007 = ~0.03137.

So, 4.4817 + 0.03137 = 4.51307.

So, e^1.507 ≈ 4.513.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the exponent is about 1.507, so e^1.507 is about 4.51.

But looking back, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So, option C is ~4.5, which is close to what I got. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation of the exponent.

The exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is (99463 K) * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) )

= 99463 * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) )

= 99463 * (500)/(33,000,000 )

= 99463 * (500)/(3.3e7)

Wait, 500/3.3e7 is approximately 1.515e-5.

So, 99463 * 1.515e-5.

Compute 1e5 *1.515e-5=1.515.

99463 is 9.9463e4, so 9.9463e4 *1.515e-5 = (9.9463 * 1.515) * (1e4 * 1e-5 ) = (approx 15.06) * 0.1 = 1.506.

So, exponent is 1.506.

So, exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

Hmm, e^1.506 is about 4.505, which is around 4.5. So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

So, the ratio (without spots)/(with spots) is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(kT\) for each temperature
Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
kT_1 = (8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000) \approx 0.517 \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
kT_2 = (8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500) \approx 0.4739 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \approx 0.151 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Now, compute \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99463 \, \text{K}.
\]

Finally, compute the exponent:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99463)(1.51 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.507.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

Answer: C
