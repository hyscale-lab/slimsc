Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking this has to do with the Saha equation and maybe the Boltzmann equation. Because when the star's temperature changes, the population of different energy levels changes, which affects the ratio of atoms in those levels.

Wait, but wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2>E1 if the transition is from lower to higher energy. Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that must mean that the denominator (n2) is increasing or the numerator (n1) is decreasing when the temperature goes down.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So in that case, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when the star doesn't have spots. So when the star is cooler, n1/n2 is smaller.

So we need to find the factor by which the ratio changes between the two cases. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write this out. Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but ΔE would be the energy difference between the two levels. Alternatively, it's related to the wavelength of the transition. Because the photon emitted corresponds to that energy difference. So the energy of the photon (h c) equals ΔE, right? So ΔE = h c / λ.

But wait, let's get that right. The energy difference between the two levels is given by ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, actually, the energy of a photon is E = hc / λ, where λ is the wavelength. So for the transition from higher to lower energy, the photon emitted has energy equal to the difference. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, the energy emitted is ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, the Boltzmann factor would be exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = exp( - (hc/(λ k)) / T )

Wait, but wait, the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because when E2 > E1, higher energy level, so the exponent is positive or negative? Let me think. The Boltzmann distribution says that n_i is proportional to g_i exp( - E_i/(k T) ). So for two levels, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) )

So yes, the ratio depends on the exponential of (ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is positive.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So let's think about how the ratio changes with T.

The exponential term is exp(ΔE/(k T)). Since ΔE is positive, when T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. So the exponent becomes a larger positive number, so the exponential itself gets larger. Wait, but that would make the ratio n1/n2 larger when T is smaller. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So maybe I got the energy levels reversed. Let me re-examine.

If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then the photon emitted is at wavelength λ. So E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ). So when T decreases, the exponent increases, making the exponential larger, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which level is higher is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the levels are such that when the star is cooler, the ratio decreases. So maybe the ratio R = n1/n2. If R decreases when T decreases, then R is inversely proportional to something.

Wait, let's think: if when T decreases, the ratio R decreases, then R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, if R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So when T decreases, the exponent increases, so R increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), R decreases. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I got the levels backward. Let me think again. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Hmm, but the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the photon emitted has energy hc/λ.

Wait, perhaps level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 > E1. So when an atom is in E2, it can transition down to E1, emitting a photon with λ = 1448 Å.

So the energy difference is E = hc / λ.

So in this case, when the star's temperature is lower, what happens to the ratio n1/n2?

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) )

So E is positive. So when T decreases, E/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star is cooler (has spots), the ratio R = n1/n2 decreases. So this doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the levels wrong. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2. Let me check the problem statement again.

The question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So that's n1/n2 when spots are present is lower than when they are not.

So when the star is cooler, n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, but based on the Boltzmann equation, if R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) ), and when T decreases, R increases, which would contradict the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let me think. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - E/(k T) )

So if T decreases, the exponent becomes less negative (because denominator is smaller), so exp(-E/(k T)) increases. So R increases, which would imply that n2/n1 increases when T decreases. But the problem says the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So if n1/n2 decreases, that implies n2/n1 increases. So maybe the ratio being considered is n2/n1, which increases when T decreases.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, and that ratio decreases when T decreases, that would mean that R ∝ exp( - something ), because when T goes down, the exponent would go down, making the exp term smaller.

Wait, perhaps I have the energy difference wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the energy difference is E = E1 - E2, which would make the exponent negative.

Wait, no. Because E2 is higher than E1, so E2-E1 is positive. So the exponent is positive. So for the case where n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ), when T decreases, the exponent (E/(k T)) increases, since E is fixed. So exp(E/(k T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, which is the opposite.

So maybe the ratio being considered is n2/n1. Because then R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Then, when T decreases, (E/(k T)) increases, so the exponential becomes smaller, so R decreases. So if R (n2/n1) decreases, but according to the problem, n1/n2 decreases. That suggests that perhaps the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that R = n1/n2 is inversely proportional to T, but according to the Boltzmann equation, R is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), which would increase as T decreases.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it another way. Let's think about the dependence of the ratio on temperature.

The ratio R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( [ (E2 - E1) ]/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So R is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), where E is positive.

If the temperature T decreases, then E/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases. So R increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, and the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So that's the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests. Therefore, I must have messed up the energy levels.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy levels are such that when the star is hotter, the lower level is more populated. Hmm, but that's getting a bit abstract.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio of the two ratios. Let's say R1 is when there are no spots, and R2 is when there are spots.

We need to find R1 / R2.

Given that R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But E2 - E1 = hc / λ, so E = hc/(λ k) * (1/T) ?

Wait, no, E = hc/λ, so (E)/(k T) = (hc)/(λ k T) ) = (h c)/(λ k T )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the formula again.

The energy of the photon emitted when transitioning from level 2 to 1 is E = hc/λ.

So, the Boltzmann factor is exp( E/(k T) ) = exp( (hc)/(λ k T) )

So, for each case (with and without spots), we can compute this factor.

But wait, when the star is hotter (no spots, T=6000 K), and when it's cooler (spots, T=5500 K).

So, R1 (no spots) = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k * 6000) )

R2 (spots) = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k * 5500) )

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp( E/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )

Wait, because when you take R1/R2, the (g1/g2) cancels, and the exponents subtract.

So R1/R2 = exp( E/(k) [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ] )

Let me calculate this exponent.

First, compute [1/6000 - 1/5500] = [5500 - 6000]/(6000 * 5500) ) = [ -500 ] / (33,000,000 ) = -500 / 3.3e7 = approximately -1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes E/(k) * (-1.515e-5)

But E = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Divide by lambda: 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = 1.372e-18 J / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ 9.94e4 = approx 99,400 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So E/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

So the exponent is 99,400 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 99400 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, that would mean the ratio R1/R2 is about 0.22, which is less than 1. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, R (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't. So R1 is the ratio when no spots, R2 when spots. So R1/R2 is 0.22, meaning R1 is smaller than R2. But that's the opposite of what the problem states.

Wait, because when the star has spots, T is lower, so according to our calculation, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( E/(k *5500) ). Since E/(k T) is larger when T is smaller, the exponential is larger, so R2 is larger than R1.

But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So that can't be right.

So perhaps I have the levels inverted. Let's say the energy levels are such that E1 > E2. So E = E1 - E2 = hc/lambda.

Wait, but that would mean that the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would be a lower energy transition, but the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is in the infrared, so lower energy. Hmm, but that depends on the actual energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in which level is higher. Let's think again.

Wait, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. So level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 > E1, so E = E2 - E1 = hc/lambda.

So the calculation we did earlier leads to R1/R2 = exp( [ E/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] ) = exp( E/(k) * ( - 1.515e-5 ) ) = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

So R1 is about 0.22 times R2. So R1 < R2, which would mean that the ratio is higher when the star has spots, which contradicts the problem statement. Because the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Wait, so perhaps the ratio they're considering is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.

If that's the case, then R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) )

So when T decreases, (E/(k T)) increases, so the exponent becomes more negative. So exp(-E/(k T)) becomes smaller, so R decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

So if the ratio being considered is n2/n1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases.

So the ratio we're looking for is R = n2/n1.

In that case, R1 (no spots) is (g2/g1) exp( - E/(k *6000) )

R2 (spots) is (g2/g1) exp( - E/(k *5500) )

So R1/R2 = exp( - E/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] ) )

Wait, wait, let's compute that.

Let me compute the exponent again.

E/(k) is approximately 99,400 K as before.

So the exponent is -99400 * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Which is -99400 * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ) 

= -99400 * ( -500 / (33e6) )

= -99400 * ( -500 / 3.3e7 )

= -99400 * (- 1.515e-5 )

= 99400 * 1.515e-5 

= approximately 1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the answer would be C) ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, \( R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \), under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting values:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Dividing by \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. The ratio \( R \) depends on the temperature \( T \). When the star has no spots (\( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \)), the ratio is \( R_1 \), and when the star has spots (\( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)), the ratio is \( R_2 \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
   \]

3. Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-99,400 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5})\right) = \exp(1.506).
   \]

4. Using \( \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which it changes is approximately \( 4.5 \). This corresponds to option **C**.

**Answer: C**
