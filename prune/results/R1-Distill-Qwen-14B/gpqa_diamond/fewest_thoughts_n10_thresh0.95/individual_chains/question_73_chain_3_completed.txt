Okay, so I've got this physics problem about relativistic speeds and energy. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my classes that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here.

So the problem says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, let me tackle the relative speed part. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different from the classical one. The classical approach would be to subtract the two velocities, but that doesn't work when speeds are a significant fraction of c.

The formula for relative velocity, v_rel, when two objects are moving at u and v from the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, but what's the direction here? Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so the astronaut with higher speed (0.6c) is moving faster than the other (0.5c). So from the perspective of the 3m astronaut moving at 0.5c, what's the speed of the 2m astronaut?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten that mixed up. Let me think again. So if an observer is moving at velocity v, then the velocity u' of another object as seen by this observer is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, the 3m astronaut is moving at 0.5c. The 2m astronaut is moving at 0.6c. So from the 3m's perspective, what is the 2m's speed? Let me apply the formula.

u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Hmm, that's about 0.14c, which is close to option C and D.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I got the perspective right. The question says 'relative speed' between them. So it could be either direction, but I think the formula gives the correct relative speed regardless of order, but I have to make sure. Wait no, actually, the formula I used is when u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the observer. So if the 3m is moving at 0.5c, and the 2m is moving at 0.6c, then from the 3m's frame, the 2m's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c.

So relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So I can eliminate A and B.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c². But wait, wait! The masses are 2m and 3m, so their energies are gamma_1 * (2m)c² and gamma_2 * (3m)c².

So I need to compute the Lorentz factors for each.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v² = 0.36 c².

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c. v² = 0.25 c².

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: E=5.96 mc², v_rel=0.14c.

Option D: E=5 mc², same v_rel.

So the correct energy should be about 5.96 mc², so option C.

Wait, let me double-check the computations.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1.25, correct. 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Gamma for 0.5c: sqrt(1/(1-0.25)) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547. 3m * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Sum: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which is 5.96 mc². So option C matches.

So the answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction at \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
