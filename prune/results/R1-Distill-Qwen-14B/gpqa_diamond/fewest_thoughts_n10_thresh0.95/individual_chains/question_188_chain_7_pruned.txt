Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the crystal has an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, which I'll get to later.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. The general formula I think is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but wait, I'm not sure if I got the exact formula right. Oh wait, the Miller indices are h, k, l, right?

Wait, wait, another thing. For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case where all edges are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, a, b, c are all 10 Angstroms because the interatomic distance is 10. No, wait, wait! Actually, wait a second. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, but in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length. But rhombohedral might not be the same. Hmm, maybe I should be careful here.

Wait, in a cubic crystal, the interatomic distance is the edge length a. So perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which would imply that a, b, c are each 10 Angstroms. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = b = c, and angles as given.

So the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but wait, I'm a little confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral lattice is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, no, because the angles are all the same, maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Oh right, another approach: The general formula for interplanar spacing is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of squares of the Miller indices multiplied by the cosines of the angles, but I might be getting the signs wrong.

Wait, the more accurate formula is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )) )

But since all angles are 30 degrees and a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, substituting into the formula, because in this case, the rhombohedral system has a = b = c and α = β = γ = 30°, so the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos30° + hl cos30° + kl cos30°) )

Since the plane is (111), h = k = l = 1.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and cos30° is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2(1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660) )

Let me compute that.

First, h² +k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Then, the second part: 2*(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) = 2*( 1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660 )

Each of the three terms is 0.8660, so sum is 3*0.8660 = 2.598.

So 2 times that is 5.196.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait because each term is hk cosα, etc. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no, the expression is 2*( hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ )

Since h=k=l=1 and all angles are 30°, each term is 1*1 * cos30°, so each is 0.8660.

So hk cosα = 1*1 *0.866 = 0.866.

Similarly, hl cosβ = same, and kl cosγ same. So each is 0.866.

So the sum is 0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866 = 2.598.

Multiply by 2, so 5.196.

So the denominator inside the square root is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the denominator sqrt of a negative number, which isn't possible. So I must have a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The formula for d is a over something. The denominator is sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

Wait, but wait, in a general crystal system, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Because in a cubic system, where all angles are 90 degrees, the cos terms are zero, so the denominator is sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct.

But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, so the cos is positive. So if I plug in h=k=l=1, then the denominator would be sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * 0.866)) )
