Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and total energies, so I need to compute both.

First, the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait. What's the direction here? Both are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed would be the difference in their velocities divided by 1 plus the product over c squared.

Wait no, wait. If an observer is in the frame of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), then the second astronaut's speed relative to him would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

So, the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = (-0.1c). The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The magnitude is 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed should be about 0.14c, but wait, the options have it as positive, so maybe in the question, the relative speed is just the magnitude. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Oh, right. Each object has relativistic kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Wait, no—total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. So each astronaut's energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each, I need to calculate gamma for their respective speeds.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each gamma.

First astronaut: v=0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Mass is 2m. So energy E1 = gamma * m c² * mass. Wait, wait. No, wait. Gamma is applied to the rest mass energy. So E1 = gamma * (m) * c²? Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass energy is m0 c², so if the mass is 2m, then E1 = gamma * 2m c².

Wait, wait. No, wait. The astronaut has a rest mass of 2m and 3m respectively. So their energies are gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy.

So for the first astronaut: gamma1 = 1.25. Mass is 2m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. So v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So gamma=1/0.866 ≈1.1547.

Mass is 3m. So E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c².

Wait, that's about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says 4.96 mc². So our total energy is around 5.96, which is option C. And the relative speed is 0.14c. So option C has both: v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

But wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. I used the formula v_relative = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c² ). Wait, but in which frame? Since both are moving in the same direction, if we're calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's perspective, then v1 is 0.6c (first astronaut's speed), and v2 is 0.5c (second's speed). So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, that's ( -0.1c )/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7= approx -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c, as I thought earlier.

So the correct relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, that's option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the first astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(v_1 = 0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### Second Astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(v_2 = 0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Relative speed: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- Total energy: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\)

These match the values in **Option C**.
