Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. And X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6.

Wait, particles in colliders are usually accelerated to relativistic speeds, so I definitely need to use relativistic equations here. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

The formula for total energy (E) is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m0c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, and since v is 0.96c, let me compute gamma first.

So let's calculate gamma. v = 0.96c. Let's plug it into the equation:

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) 
Wait, (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is... Let me think. 0.28^2 is 0.0784, since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714... Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, but I should be precise because the problem requires 1e-4 precision. So let me compute it exactly. Let me compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 28*28=784, and 0.28^2=0.0784. So yes, sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0c². The mass m0 is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of approximately 1.007276 u for protons and 1.008664 u for neutrons, but wait, that's the mass when they're part of a nucleus, right? Or wait, no, the exact masses
