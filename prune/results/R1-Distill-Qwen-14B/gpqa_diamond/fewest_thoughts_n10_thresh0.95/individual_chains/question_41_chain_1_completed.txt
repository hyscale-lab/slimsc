Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait a second, speed of light in a medium... normally, when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the speed from the lab frame?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right! The velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving, we have to consider how the light's velocity transforms when the medium is moving. But wait, the glass's movement is at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

The standard velocity addition formula from relativity is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, this is when you have a velocity u in one frame and you want to find it in a frame moving at speed v relative to the first. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

In this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light? The light's speed in the glass is c/n, but that's in the glass's rest frame. So from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be different.

Wait, so in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So I need to apply the velocity transformation to find the speed in the lab frame. So u is the velocity of the light in the glass (u = c/n) and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. But wait, the direction matters. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light in the glass is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's speed in the glass frame is c/n, and the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame.

So the transformation would be from the glass's frame (S') to the lab frame (S). So in S', the light's speed is c/n. We need to find u, the speed in S.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² ), where u' is the speed in S' (the glass frame), and v is the speed of S' relative to S.

Wait, but the direction matters. Let me think about the signs. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then in S', the light is moving at c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion. So when transforming to S, what's the formula?

Actually, I might have confused the formula. The correct velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)). But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the sign. Another way: if the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the formula for transforming a velocity u' in S' to u in S is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, u' is the velocity of the light in S', which is c/n. And v is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v (since the glass is moving at v in the lab). So substituting into the formula:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator. Let's compute (c/n * v) / c²:

(c v) / (n c²) ) = v/(n c).

So the denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c).

Wait, the formula comes from special relativity, so maybe I should express everything in terms of units where c=1, which the problem says to do. So c=1, which simplifies things.

So substituting c=1, u' = 1/n. Then v is just the velocity of the glass in the lab frame.

So the formula becomes u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v )

That's the same as ( (1 + n v ) / n ) / ( (n + v)/n )

Wait, because denominator is 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n. So:

u = [ (1 + n v ) / n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ]

The denominators are same in numerator and denominator. So they cancel out. So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v). So the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

But wait a second. Let me think again. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light is going in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So when you add velocities, the direction is such that both are adding. So the initial thinking is correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass. So the light is moving from the glass towards the observer, which is in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, no, u' is the velocity in the glass frame. So if the glass is moving at v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then in the glass frame, the light's speed is u' = c/n (towards the direction of motion). So when you transform to the lab frame, the velocity adds.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v).

Wait, let me double-check the formula. When you have a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and an object in that frame moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as v, the lab frame's object velocity u is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

So substituting u' = c/n, and c=1, u' =1/n.

So u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (v)/(n)) )

Which is same as (v +1/n) / (1 + v/n )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate fractions:

Numerator: n v +1

Denominator: n + v

So u = (n v +1)/(n + v) = (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Yes, that's option A.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light's speed in the glass's rest frame is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \) in this problem). The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light and toward the observer. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
