Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca forms a complex with EDTA. The problem is asking about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That means the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the question is, what's the concentration of free Ca²+ ions?

Oh, right, because in solution, the complex can dissociate a bit. The formation constant K is given, which tells us how stable the complex is. K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is probably:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

Wait, I think that's right. So, the K for this reaction is Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in the problem, the concentration given is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex. So, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. But what about the free EDTA and Ca²+?

Assuming that the concentration of free Ca²+ is much lower than the concentration of the complex because K is large. K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation is minimal, meaning [Ca²+] is very small.

Let me write the K expression again:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

But wait, in this solution, the only source of EDTA is the complex itself because it's a stoichiometric solution, right? So, initially, all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But wait, that can't be right because the complex can dissociate a little, releasing some Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Hmm, but how does that work? Let me think. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so initially, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. When it dissociates a little 'x' amount, then [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4−] = x. Because each mole of complex dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

So substituting into the K expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So that's 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 2/(5e13) = 4e-14.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5)) * (1e-2 / 1e10) ) = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13.

Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Oh, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, so [Ca²+] = x = 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check my assumptions. Another thing: the problem says the solution is stoichiometric Ca-EDTA. Does that affect anything?

Stoichiometric means the ratio is 1:1, which I think is what I assumed. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and upon dissociation, each x releases 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 of EDTA each. So that should be correct.

Another way to think about it: the dissociation is so small that the change is negligible compared to 0.02, so [CaEDTA^2−] is approximately 0.02 M, which is correct because K is so large that the dissociation is minimal.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation releases an equal amount of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), denoted as \(x\). Thus, at equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{(since dissociation is minimal due to large \(K\))},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
