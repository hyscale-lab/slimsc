Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics are often represented as matrices, and eigenvectors are the vectors that only get scaled by the operator.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the full operator P along an arbitrary direction n would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction cosines of n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component (direction cosine for y) should be zero. So, the arbitrary direction is some angle θ from the x-axis towards the z-axis, right? So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Wait, no, wait. Direction vectors are usually expressed as (l, m, n), where l is cosθ, but sometimes it's the other way around. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So in the x-z plane, the direction would be θ measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But wait, the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so φ is zero or anything? Wait no, in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, but for an arbitrary direction, φ could be any value, but since it's in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is measured from the z-axis. Or maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. I might need to clarify that. 

Wait, regardless, the operator P along the direction n would be the sum of the components. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Each of the P components is given. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. 

Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. 

So, the operator P is (n_x * P_x ) + (n_z * P_z ). 

Let me compute that. Let me denote n_x as a and n_z as b, with a² + b² = 1 because it's a unit vector.

So, P = (a * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (b * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute each term:

a*(ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, aħ/2], [aħ/2, 0]]

b*(ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[bħ/2, 0], [0, -bħ/2]]

Adding these together:

P = [[bħ/2, aħ/2], [aħ/2, -bħ/2]]

So the matrix form of P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[b, a], [a, -b]], because:

First row: [bħ/2, aħ/2] = (ħ/2)[b, a]
Second row: [a ħ/2, -b ħ/2] = (ħ/2)[a, -b]

So, P = (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

We are to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector [v1, v2]^T.

Substituting into the equation:

(ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]] * [v1; v2] = (ħ/2) [v1; v2]

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

So the matrix equation becomes:

b v1 + a v2 = v1

a v1 - b v2 = v2

Rearranging the first equation:

(b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0 → equation (1)

The second equation:

a v1 - (b + 1) v2 = 0 → equation (2)

So, we have a system of two equations:

(b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0

a v1 - (b + 1) v2 = 0

We can write this in matrix form:

[ (b-1)   a       ] [v1]   = [0]
[ a      -(b+1) ] [v2]     [0]

For a non-trivial solution (eigenvector), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Determinant = (b-1)(-(b+1)) - a^2 = 0

Compute determinant: -(b² + b - b -1) - a² → -(b² -1) - a² = 0 → -(b² -1) - a² = 0 → 1 - b² - a² = 0 → but since a² + b² = 1 (because n is a unit vector), 1 - (a² + b²) = 0 → 1-1=0 → 0=0. So the determinant is zero, which is consistent.

So, the system is dependent, and we can find a relationship between v1 and v2.

From equation (1):

(b-1) v1 + a v2 = 0 → v2 = [ (1 - b) / a ] v1

Wait, but I have to be careful about a=0. If a=0, then what? Let's see, but n is in x-z plane, so a = n_x could be zero if direction is along z. For example, if n is along z, then a=0, b=1 or -1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary but in x-z plane. So a could be zero, but in that case, the first equation would be (b-1) v1 = 0 and the second equation would be a v1 - (b+1) v2 = 0. If a=0, then equation (1): (b-1) v1 =0. So if b=1 (along +z), then equation (1) is 0, and equation (2) becomes 0*v1 - (1+1) v2 =0 → -2 v2=0 → v2=0. So eigenvector is [v1, 0]^T, which for P_z: P_z |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → but P_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So along +z, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,0]^T. So that's consistent.

But for our general case, a is not zero. So proceeding, v2 = [(1 -b)/a ] v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, (1 -b)/a v1]^T. Let me factor out v1: v1 [1, (1-b)/a ]^T.

But we can choose v1 as a parameter, say v1 = 1, then the vector is [1, (1 -b)/a ]^T. But we need to normalize it.

Wait, but this is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me verify the equations again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. So, perhaps I should have subtracted the eigenvalue to set up the equation as (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Let me redo this part.

The correct setup is (P - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So, eigenvalue equation after moving everything to one side:

[P - (ħ/2) I] |v> = 0.

So, expanding P, which is (ħ/2) [[b, a], [a, -b]].

So, the matrix P - (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [[b, a], [a, -b]] - (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

Which is (ħ/2) [ [b-1, a], [a, -b -1] ]

So the system is:

( (b-1) ) v1 + a v2 = 0

a v1 + ( - (b +1) ) v2 = 0

So, same as before.

So, the eigenvectors are multiples of [ a, (1 - b) ]^T. Let me see: from the first equation, (b-1) v1 + a v2 =0 → a v2 = (1 - b) v1 → v2 = ( (1 -b)/a ) v1.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1 -b)/a ]^T.

But we can factor out a 'a' in the denominator. Let me write this as [a, (1 - b)]^T multiplied by 1/a. So the direction is [a, 1 -b]^T.

Wait, but if I take the eigenvector as [a, 1 - b], does that work? Let's check with a specific example. For example, when direction is along +x (so a=1, b=0). Then the eigenvector would be [1, 1]^T. Let's see.

The operator P when a=1, b=0 would be (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1], up to normalization. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is [1,1], which when normalized is (1/sqrt2)[1,1]. So, using our formula, [a, 1 - b] would be [1,1], which is correct. So that's a good sign.

Another example: direction along +z (a=0, b=1). Then, the eigenvector would be [0, 0], but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, when a=0, [a, 1 -b] = [0,0]. But that's a problem. Wait, perhaps when a=0, I need to approach it differently. Let me think. When a=0, the system becomes:

From equation (1): (b-1) v1 = 0.

Equation (2): - (b +1) v2 = 0.

So, if b=1 (along +z), equation (1) gives 0*v1=0, equation (2) gives -2 v2=0 → v2=0. So the eigenvector is any multiple of [1, 0]^T, which is correct because P_z has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for [1,0]^T.

Wait, but when a=0, the previous expression [a, (1 -b)/a ] would have a division by zero. So perhaps I should write the eigenvector in a different way when a=0. But in our general case, a isn't zero, so I'll proceed.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [a, 1 - b]^T. So let's write the components as v1 = a, v2 = (1 -b).

But wait, in our previous example where a=1, b=0, v1 =1, v2=1, which works. Another example: let's pick a direction that's at 45 degrees in x-z plane, say θ = 45 degrees from z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ = sqrt(2)/2, n_z = cosθ = sqrt(2)/2. So a = sqrt(2)/2, b = sqrt(2)/2. Then, the eigenvector would be [a, (1 - b)] = [sqrt(2)/2, 1 - sqrt(2)/2]. Let's compute the components.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of the direction angles. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the spherical angles would have φ=0 or φ=π, but θ from z-axis.

Wait, for a general direction in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But since it's in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. But for an arbitrary direction, φ can be any value, but since it's in x-z plane, perhaps φ is 0 (or π) but θ varies. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle φ in spherical coordinates would be 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. So for a general direction in the x-z plane, the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but φ is either 0 or π. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. The spherical coordinate system defines θ as the angle from the positive z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So, any point in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π. Because in the x-z plane, the projection onto the x-y plane is along the x-axis, so φ=0 (for positive x) or φ=π (for negative x). So, for a general direction in x-z, the direction vector is (sinθ cos(0), 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), or with cos 0 =1. So, a = sinθ, b= cosθ.

So, substituting a = sinθ, b = cosθ.

Then, the eigenvector components are [a, 1 - b] = [sinθ, 1 - cosθ].

Wait, but 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So, let's see:

v1 = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

v2 = 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

So, the vector is [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), 2 sin²(θ/2)].

We can factor out 2 sin(θ/2):

= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), 2 sin^2(θ/2)] = 2 sin(θ/2) [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

So, the vector is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the signs. Because when φ is 0, as in our case, the direction is along positive x and positive z. So, the eigenvector would have components as I've found. But let's think about normalization.

The vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] is already normalized, since cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, but in our earlier substitution, the vector is 2 sin(θ/2) times [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ], which would be 2 sin(θ/2) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but the actual vector after substituting a and b is [ sinθ, 1 - cosθ ].

So, the vector is [ sinθ, 1 - cosθ ]. Let's compute the magnitude squared:

( sinθ )^2 + (1 - cosθ )^2 = sin²θ + 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ.

= (sin²θ + cos²θ) +1 - 2 cosθ → 1 + 1 - 2 cosθ = 2 (1 - cosθ) = 4 sin²(θ/2).

So, the magnitude is sqrt(4 sin²(θ/2)) ) = 2 |sin(θ/2)|.

Since θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is positive, so the magnitude is 2 sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ sinθ, 1 - cosθ ] divided by 2 sin(θ/2).

Compute each component:

sinθ / (2 sin(θ/2)) = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / (2 sin(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2).

(1 - cosθ ) / (2 sin(θ/2)) = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / (2 sin(θ/2) ) )= sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the direction, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any factors of ħ, because the eigenvectors are unit vectors and don't carry units. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta )

Wait, but in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is either 0 or pi. So option B would be (cos theta, sin theta ), but multiplied by e^{i phi}. But in our case, phi=0 or pi, so e^{i phi} is either 1 or -1. But our eigenvector doesn't have that factor. Also, our solution doesn't involve phi because the direction is along x-z, so phi is fixed.

Wait, but in the options, option C is the correct one, but let me check the other options.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but eigenvectors are normalized vectors, so they shouldn't have ħ multiplied. Because ħ is a unit of action, but vectors are dimensionless. So options A and D have ħ in them, which seems incorrect. So I can eliminate options A and D.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta). But in our case, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so option B doesn't match.

Option C is exactly what we derived. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector is zero, and the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ for a direction $\vec{n}$ at an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis. Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the equation and simplifying, the eigenvector components are found to satisfy:

\[
v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad v_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate system but does not match the derived eigenvector components for the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector components $\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients, making it inconsistent with the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
