Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum, but let's think this through.

So the question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, right? And c is h/(4π). Oh wait, h is Planck's constant, but I think it's actually written as ħ sometimes, which is h/(2π). Wait, no, in this case, c is h/(4π), so c = ħ/2. Interesting.

What's the matrix S? The first row is (0, -i) and the second is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, or maybe something else. Let me recall. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right! So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So S = σy.

So Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), and σy is the Pauli matrix, then Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's start with the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix like σy are ±1. Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by those. So a = c * (+1) = (h/(4π)) * 1 = h/(4π), and a = (h/(4π))*(-1) = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues should be ±h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +2πh or –2πh, which doesn't make sense because h/(4π) is real. So A can't be right. Option B: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Wait, but the eigenvalues are real because h/(4π) is real. So B is probably wrong too.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm, well, for angular momentum operators, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's an eigenstate of A² (since [Ay, A²] = 0, because A² is the sum of the squares of the components). So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C could be correct. But the second part says not of Az. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the components don't commute. So a state can't be an eigenstate of two different components simultaneously. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it cannot be an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in C is correct. But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, so we'll check all options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure what that means. Basis functions for a 2x2 matrix operator... Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure if that's what D is saying. Maybe it's saying that the eigenvectors are the basis vectors, but in any case, I'm not certain. Let me think about other options first.

Wait, what about the structure of the eigenvalues. The operator Ay has real eigenvalues, as we found earlier. So any option mentioning imaginary parts is incorrect. So A and B are out because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So that leaves us with C and D.

Option D says the eigenvectors are the basis functions of Ay. I think that refers to the matrix representation. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So D's statement might be correct, but I'm not entirely sure about the wording. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator? Or that they serve as a basis? Well, the eigenvectors do form a basis, so D's statement could be correct.

Now, option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is true because A² is the Casimir operator, and it commutes with all components. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². And they can't be eigenstates of Az because of the commutation relations; you can't have a state that's an eigenstate of two different components.

So, the correct statements would be C. But let me double-check:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect.

Eigenvectors of Ay are eigenstates of A², so C's first part is correct. And they can't be eigenstates of Az, so the second part is correct. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a 2×2 matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
a = c \cdot (\pm 1) = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are real, with no imaginary components. This immediately rules out options A and B, which incorrectly suggest imaginary parts for the eigenvalues.

For option C, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), the square of the angular momentum operator, because \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of angular momentum. However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of the Z-component \( A_z \), as angular momentum components do not commute. This makes the statement in option C correct.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D space, the wording of this option is ambiguous and less precise than the statement in option C. Thus, option D is not the best choice.

The correct answer is option C, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
