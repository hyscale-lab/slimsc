Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through what each part means.

So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor here is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, when we observe it, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star, causing a dip in brightness. They're asking what the radius of a hypothetical planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius (which is same as the Sun's radius here). 

First, let's think about the brightness variations caused by the spots. When the spots are on the visible side, they make the star appear slightly dimmer because they're cooler. If the star wasn't spotted, a planet transiting in front would block some light, causing a dip. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

So the key is to calculate the change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots and compare it to the change caused by a planet, then set them equal to find the planet's size.

Let's break it down. 

The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its surface area and temperature. The spots contribute less brightness because they're cooler. The effective temperature is the average, but when spots are present, the observed flux changes.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's denote Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so the area covered is 0.2 on that hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Wait, no: filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) multiplied by 2 because there's one hemisphere facing us, but when the star rotates, the other side comes into view? Wait, no, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So from our perspective, only that hemisphere is spotted, but when the star rotates, the spots are on the side we can see. So the spots are always on the same side as the star rotates, so the brightness variations result from the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait, no, the problem says 'only one hemisphere is spotty', so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out. So the area of the star's disk that is spotted when it's facing us is 20% of that hemisphere.

I think the correct approach is to model the change in the star's brightness when the spots are visible.

The total flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (Area) / (4π d²), but maybe I don't need to get into that level of detail. Alternatively, the flux is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π d²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar² /d². Wait, but when we calculate the flux from the star's surface, each point emits according to its own temperature. So with spots, the flux is F = (F_unspotted * (1 - filling factor) + F_spotted * filling factor) ), but only for the hemisphere facing us. Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is normal.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π Rstar². When one hemisphere is spotted (so 2π Rstar²), and on that hemisphere, 20% is covered by spots.

So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar². The unspotted area in that hemisphere is (2π Rstar² - 0.4 π Rstar²) = 1.6 π Rstar². The other hemisphere (2π Rstar²) is completely unspotted.

So the total area is 4π Rstar², with 0.4π Rstar² being spots, and the rest being at Teff.

So the total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us is:

F = (Area_unspotted * T_eff^4 + Area_spotted * T_spot^4 ) / (4π Rstar²) ) * σ * (4π Rstar² / (4π d²)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of luminosity. The star's total luminosity is 4π R² σ Teff^4. The spots contribute less, so when the star rotates, the observed flux changes.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the relative change in flux when the spots are visible. Let me model the brightness variation when the spots are on the near side (causing a dip) and when they're on the far side (full brightness).

Wait, but the problem says that the photometric observations show a dip when the spots are on the visible side. The amplitude of that dip is the same as the dip caused by a planet transit.

So the dip from the spots is the maximum when 100% of the spotted area is visible. How much is the dip in terms of the star's total flux?

The total flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π d²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar² / d².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (4π Rstar² - A_spots) * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d² )

The dip is (F0 - F) / F0.

But I'm more interested in the fractional change (delta F / F0).

Let me compute F when the spots are fully visible. The area of the spots is A_spots = 0.2 * (2π Rstar² / 2) )? Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the hemisphere is 2π Rstar² in area. The spots cover 20% of that, so A_spots = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = [ (4π Rstar² - A_spots) * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d² )

Which can be written as F = [ (4π Rstar²) Teff^4 - A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ) ] * σ / (4π d² )

So F = F0 * [1 - (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4π Rstar² Teff^4) ) ]

The fractional change is (F0 - F)/F0 = (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4π Rstar² Teff^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K (since they're 1000 K cooler).

A_spots = 0.4 π Rstar².

So,

delta_F / F0 = [0.4 π Rstar^2 * (6000^4 - 5000^4) ] / [4 π Rstar^2 * 6000^4 ]

The Rstar^2 and pi terms cancel out.

= [0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (0.4 /4) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747.

So the fractional change is about 5.177% when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but that's the maximum dip. The problem says that the photometric variations are periodic because the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum dip is about 5.177% of the star's brightness.

Now, the question is, what radius of a planet would cause the same dip when it transits the star.

The transit method causes a dip in brightness equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is (pi R_planet^2 / pi R_star^2) = (R_planet / R_star )^2.

So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star )^2.

We set this equal to 0.0517747.

So,

(R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0517747

Take square root:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options are near 0.227. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating the area of the spots. Let me reevaluate.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of a hemisphere. The area of a hemisphere is 2π R², so spots' area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Yes, that's correct.

Then, the calculation for delta F over F0 was:

[0.4 π R² (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² 6000^4 ]

Simplify, the R² and pi cancel. So:

[0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Which is 0.4 /4 = 0.1 times (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Which is 0.1 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Wait, that's correct. So 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.482253) ≈ 0.05177.

So the fractional dip is about 5.177%.

And the planet's dip is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 5.177% ≈ 0.05177.

So sqrt(0.05177) is about 0.227, or ~0.23.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, but that's larger. B) is 0.07, which is about (0.07)^2=0.0049, way smaller than our 0.05177. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculated the effect of the spots. Let me think again.

Wait, when the spots are on the visible side, the star's brightness decreases because that area is emitting less flux. But maybe the calculation should consider the fact that the spots are on only one hemisphere, so when they are facing us, their effect is maximum. But when the star rotates and the other hemisphere comes into view, the spots are on the far side, so the brightness returns to normal.

Wait, but in my calculation, I considered the maximum dip when all the spots are on the near side. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the 5.177% dip. So when a planet transits, it would also cause a dip of the same amplitude, which is 5.177%.

So the planet's effect is (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.05177. So R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait another thought: The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The planet's radius, Rpl, is required such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177. So Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ Rstar * 0.227.

But the options don't have 0.227. Let's see the options again.

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. 0.227 is approximately 0.23, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the spots' filling factor is per hemisphere, but when the star is viewed, only a portion of the spots is visible depending on the rotation. Or perhaps I didn't consider that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots' rotation, and the amplitude is the change when the spots go from being on the backside (no dip) to front side (full dip). So perhaps the maximum dip is the same as I calculated, but the amplitude of the variation (the peak to peak) would be twice that dip? Or perhaps not.

Wait, no. The dip is from F0 to F. The amplitude is the difference between F0 and F. So it's a single dip of ~5% when the spots are on the near side. 

But wait, maybe I should think about the fact that the star's brightness fluctuates as the spots rotate into and out of view. So the maximum dip is 5.177%, and the maximum increase when the spots are on the far side would be zero dip (brightness is F0), so perhaps the variation is 5.177% below F0. So the amplitude is 5.177% of F0.

But perhaps I should consider the average brightness when the spots are visible or not. Or maybe the spot's effect is on the entire rotation period, so perhaps the average brightness is less than F0. But the question says that the photometric time-series show periodic variations, which are due to the spots rotating. So the maximum dip is when the spotted area is fully visible.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change. Let me re-calculate the fractional change.

delta_F = F0 - F
F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π d²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar² / d².

F = [ (4π Rstar² - A_spots ) * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d² )

So F = σ [ (4π Rstar² Teff^4 - A_spots Teff^4 + A_spots T_spot^4 ) ] / (4π d² )

So F = F0 * [ (4π Rstar² Teff^4 - A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4π Rstar² Teff^4 ) ]

Which simplifies to F0 * [ 1 - ( A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ) / (4π Rstar² Teff^4 ) ]

So delta_F / F0 is [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ) ] / [4π Rstar² Teff^4 ]

Plugging in numbers:

A_spots = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the hemisphere's area is 2π Rstar². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So,

delta_F/F0 = [ 0.4 π Rstar² (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [4 π Rstar² (6000^4 ) ]

The Rstar² and pi terms cancel.

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

= (0.4 /4 ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4

= 0.1 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So, 1-0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So yes, the fractional dip is 5.177%.

So when the planet transits, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276, or approximately 0.23.

But wait, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is considering the spot's effect as a brightness variation when it's on the near side and when it's not. So it's a maximum dip of 5% when the spots are fully visible. So the planet needs to cause the same dip, which would require a radius of ~0.23 Rstar. But the options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the same amplitude as the
