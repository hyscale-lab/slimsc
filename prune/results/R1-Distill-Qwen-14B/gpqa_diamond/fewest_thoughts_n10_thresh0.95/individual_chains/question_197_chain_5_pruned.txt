Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI is a reaction that typically leads to the formation of an acid from an ester. Oh wait, wait, no, more accurately, I think it's related to the hydrolysis of esters. Or maybe it's about the substitution of certain groups.

First, let me look at the spectral data. The IR shows peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but sometimes they can be a bit higher. Or maybe it's an ester. Oh wait, the 1720 is a bit higher than a typical carboxylic acid (usually around 1700), so maybe it's an ester. But wait, in the IR, if there's a broad peak from 3400-2500, that might suggest an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid because esters don't have O-H (they have O-C-O). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but the 1720 could fit either a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester. Let me think more.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very high shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, the carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. So that's a possibility. Wait, but sometimes in DMSO, the peak can be upfield a bit, but 10.5 is pretty high. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Let me jot down the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): likely a carboxylic acid proton.
- 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H): aromatic protons, maybe as part of a para-substituted benzene?
- 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H): another set of aromatic protons, maybe in the para position.
- 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H): maybe a CH next to an oxygen? Or perhaps a CH in a branched chain.
- 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H): possibly adjacent to something like a CH or a branching point.
- 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H): maybe a methyl group attached to something, like a CH2 or a branch.
- 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H): likely a terminal methyl
