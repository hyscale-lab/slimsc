Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, state vectors can be written in terms of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. So, these are the standard basis states for the spin-1/2 system, right?

But wait, the state |alpha> isn't normalized yet, it's just proportional. So I need to normalize it first. To do that, I'll calculate the norm (or squared magnitude) of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute their magnitudes. The magnitude of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²).

So for (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And for (2 - i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem mentions an operator with a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what is the dimension of this matrix? Since it's acting on spin-1/2 states, the dimension should be 2x2. So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. I think this is the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, because when we measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

But wait, since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenvalues should be ± (hbar/2). Let me confirm.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[b, a]] are (a ± b). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Pauli X matrix's eigenvalues are ±1. So scaling it by hbar/2 would give eigenvalues ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- = -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors for Pauli X are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenvectors of A are the same as those of sigma_x, just scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvectors don't change when you scale the matrix. So the eigenstates for A are the same as for sigma_x; they are |+x> and |-x>.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, I can perform a change of basis from the z-basis (|up>, |down>) to the x-basis (|+x>, |–x>).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities by considering the projectors onto the eigenstates of A. Let me think.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So I can write |alpha> as a combination of these.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-. Since |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the inner product < +x | alpha > is c_+.

Compute < +x | alpha >. Since |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), and < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

Wait, let me compute that.

(1+i) comes from <up| alpha>, and (2-i) comes from <down| alpha>.

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator: (1 + i) + (2 - i) = 1+2 +i -i = 3. So numerator is 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha >.

The inner product < -x | alpha > is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) multiplied by |alpha>.

So,

c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

Compute numerator:

(1 +i) - (2 -i ) = 1 - 2 + i + i = -1 + 2i.

So c_- is (-1 +2i) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Then, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²: (3)^2 / [ (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))² ] → 9/(7*2) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but let me check the denominator: (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))^2 is 7*2=14, yes. So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Similarly, |c_-|² is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 divided by (14). The numerator is (sqrt((-1)^2 + (2)^2 ))^2 = (1 +4) =5. So |c_-|² =5/14 ≈ 0.35714, which is about 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, but 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14≈0.3571, which is approximately 0.36. So that seems to match option A.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation of c_+ and c_-.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So when I take the inner product with |+x>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), we have:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Which is (3) / (sqrt(14)) → 3/sqrt(14).

So |c_+|² is (9)/(14) = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

And c_- is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → [ (-1 +2i) ] / sqrt(14).

So |c_-|² is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which are close to 0.64 and 0.36, matching option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Hmm, but I also need to compute the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, and the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|², the expectation value is (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) ) → [ (9 -5) hbar/2 ] /14 → (4 hbar/2 ) /14 → (2 hbar ) /14 → hbar/(7).

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

So that would match option A, which states average is hbar/7.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → matches.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7) → no.

So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I correctly compute the average value?

Another approach: Compute <A> using the original state.

Express |alpha> in the z-basis: |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this as:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i); (2-i) ] / sqrt(7) )

Wait, because |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, <A> = (1/sqrt(7))² [ (1-i) (2+i) (hbar/2) + (2+i) (1-i) (hbar/2) ]

Wait, let me compute A acting on |alpha> first, then the inner product.

Wait, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So when you multiply A by |alpha>, you get:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2-i) ) , ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2 - i) ) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Compute each component:

The first component: (hbar/2)*(2 - i) → (hbar/2)(2) - (hbar/2)(i) → hbar - i hbar/2.

Second component: (hbar/2)(1 +i) → hbar/2 + i hbar/2.

Then, the inner product of <alpha| with this vector is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar - i hbar/2 ) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2 + i hbar/2) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

Compute <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i) (2 + i) (hbar/2) + (2 + i) (1 -i) (hbar/2) ] /7.

Wait, because when you compute A times |alpha>, the first element is (hbar/2)(2-i), the second is (hbar/2)(1+i).

Then, the inner product is (1-i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(hbar/2)(1 +i).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) → 2(1) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i. Multiply by hbar/2: (hbar/2)(1-3i).

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) → 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i² → 2 + 3i -1 → 1 +3i. Multiply by hbar/2: (hbar/2)(1 +3i).

So adding these two terms:

( hbar/2 (1 -3i) ) + ( hbar/2 (1 +3i) ) = hbar/2 [ (1 +1) + (-3i +3i) ] = hbar/2 * 2 = hbar.

So <A> = hbar /7.

Which matches option A's average value.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, calculate the squared magnitude of the coefficients:
- For (1+i): |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2.
- For (2-i): |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5.
- Total squared norm = 2 + 5 = 7.

Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is given by:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is the Pauli X matrix scaled by \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\). The eigenstates of A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates:
\[
|\alpha⟩ = c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |-x⟩.
\]
The coefficients \(c_+\) and \(c_-\) are calculated as:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7}.
\]
- For \(c_+\): \((1+i) + (2-i) = 3\), so \(c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\).
- For \(c_-\): \((1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i\), so \(c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\).

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
|c_+|² = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_-|² = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately:
\[
P(+x) \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues of A, \(\lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(\lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2}\), the expectation value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \lambda_+ + P(-x) \lambda_-.
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
