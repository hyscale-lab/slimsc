Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options given have different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds in Newtonian mechanics because of relativity. Oh right, I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's not as simple as subtracting the two speeds because of the effects of relativity.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Right, so I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c. Let me compute that.

So, v1 = 0.6c, v2 = 0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's the v_rel part.

Now, the total energy of the system. The system is composed of the two astronauts, so I think their energies add up. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared.

Wait, but wait! The masses are 2m and 3m, so each has their own gamma factor based on their speed.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = approximately 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E = 5.96 mc², which matches closely. Option D has E=5 mc², which is too low, so I think option C is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says 'the total energy of the system.' Hmm, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of each object's energy. So yeah, that's what I did.

Alternatively, does the system's rest mass energy come into play here? No, because each astronaut is moving, so their energies are each calculated and summed.

So putting it together: relative speed is about 0.14c and total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which matches.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction in special relativity is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
