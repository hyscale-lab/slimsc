--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titrations, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Okay, first, I'll try to outline the steps I remember from my notes. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction should form acetate ions and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted.

Wait, but wait—since we diluted the acetic acid, I need to find the new concentration after dilution. Dilution affects the concentration, right? So the initial step is to calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (let's call it C1) is calculated using M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging the numbers: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Oh, okay, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% and equivalence point.

Wait, the 25% titration—does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized? Or is it 25% of the volume added? Hmm, in titration terms, when they say 25% titration, I think it refers to the fraction of the acetic acid neutralized by the base. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been reacted with NaOH. So, first, I need to find the equivalence point volume, then take 25% of that to determine the pH at that point.

So, let's find the equivalence point. Moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added must equal moles of acetic acid (since the reaction is 1:1). So n(NaOH) = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is n / C = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.00025 mol has reacted. So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the Ka of acetic acid, which is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.736.

So plugging in the concentrations:
Henderson equation: pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)
Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 1/3 is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259. So approximately 4.26. That's one part.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions comes from the moles of acetate divided by the total volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water:
CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, since Kb is small, I can approximate the [OH^-] using the formula sqrt(Kb * C), but I need to check if the approximation is valid.

Wait, the concentration is 0.02 M. Let me compute Kb * C: 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Since this is much less than 1e-8, the approximation holds.

So the [OH^-] is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait a second. The options don't include 9.02. Hmm. What did I do wrong?

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the Kb calculation: Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(approx 2e-5) )= approx 5e-10. So that part is correct.

Then [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COOH] = x. So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

But looking at the options:

Option D says equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right because equivalence point should be basic. Option A says 8.52, which is close but not exactly 9. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed something about the dilution. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculate the equivalence point volume, I got 10 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³.

But wait, when NaOH is added to the acetic acid solution, the total volume might not just be additive. But for the sake of approximation, especially in a problem like this, we usually assume the volumes are additive. So 50 cm³ is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation or the formula. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.736. Then Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct. So the Kb is correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for pH when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid. So pH = pKa + log ( (moles of A^-) / (moles of HA) )

But at equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-. So moles A^- = moles HA initially (since all reacted). Wait, no, wait, at equivalence, moles of HA are zero, and moles of A^- are equal to the initial moles of HA. So the solution is just A^- in water.

Wait, so the solution is acetate ions, which is a base. So the pH should be higher than 7. So my previous calculation of 9.02 makes sense. But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's acidic, which doesn't make sense for the equivalence point of a weak acid titrated with strong base.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → equivalence point is 8.52, which is still basic, but not as high as 9. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH using the exact method without the approximation.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let me let x = [OH^-]. Then [CH3COOH] = x. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is very small.

So, Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH = log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 -4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the options are wrong or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of acetate.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all of it is converted to acetate, so moles of acetate are 0.001. The total volume is 50 cm³, so [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem was not at equivalence point but at the 25% titration, I made a mistake. Let me recheck that part.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So moles reacted: 0.00025. Remaining acetic acid: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[ A^- ] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.736, as before.

Log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → log (0.33333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259 → ~4.26.

So 4.26 is correct for the 25% point. Now, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But earlier I calculated pH of 9.02 at equivalence.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the concentration correctly. Another approach to calculate the pH at equivalence point when dealing with a weak acid's conjugate base is to use the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKb)/2?

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the hydrolysis equation correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate using the exact formula, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation.

So, the expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me denote [OH^-] as x. Then [CH3COOH] is x.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02).

So, Kb = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ ~4.98, pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. Looking at the options again:

Option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid concentration.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) / 40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have considered that when you dilute, the concentration is lower, but the same for the titration. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point volume.

Wait, equivalence moles: 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M → volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the NaOH added as 25% of the initial solution? No, that doesn't make sense because the titration is about the moles reacted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH at the equivalence point correctly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let's recheck.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

Compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. So that's correct.

So, why are the options not matching. Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.57;6.92. So equivalence point pH is 6.92, which is lower than 7, which would imply it's acidic. That can't be right for a weak base solution. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait a moment—could I have confused the order of the Henderson equation? Let me think: pH = pKa + log (base/acid). So, at 25% titration, base is 0.00025, acid is 0.00075. So ratio is 1/3, log is -0.477, so pH is 4.736 -0.477 = 4.259, which is about 4.26. So the first part is correct.

For the equivalence point, maybe I should use the hydrolysis formula differently. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not purely the acetate, but perhaps there's another factor.

Wait, wait, no. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.02 M acetate ion, which should hydrolyze to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

Hmm. So if my calculation leads to a pH of ~9.02, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in another step.

Wait, the problem statement says that after diluting with 20 cm³ water, the solution is titrated. So the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, when titrating, the volumes of NaOH added are to be considered.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using exact Kb calculation, considering the exact [OH^-].

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for a weak base:

[OH^-] = sqrt( K_b * C )

But wait, that's the approximation, and it worked. So I think the pH should be around 9.02, but it's not in any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the 25% of the titration based on the volume, not on the moles.

Wait, in some cases, 25% titration is 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So if equivalence is 10 cm³, then 25% is 2.5 cm³ added. That's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the pH after adding 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is what I did.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has pH 4.57 and 6.92. So equivalence pH is 6.92, which is below 7. That would imply a solution of a weak acid, not a weak base. That’s wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations for the equivalence point. Let's try another approach.

Another way to compute the pH at equivalence is to find the concentration of OH^- ions.

CH3COO^- is a weak base. Its Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

We can set up the equation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COOH] = x, so:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10

Since x is very small compared to 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

Same result. Therefore, perhaps none of the options are correct. But looking back, option A says at equivalence, pH is 8.52. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pKa calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(5.405e4) → approximately 4.73.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5 → pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(5.405e4) → 4.733. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the concentration of acetate at equivalence.

Wait, moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should calculate using the exact approach without approximation.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me let [OH^-] = x. Then [CH3COOH] = x.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So Kb = (x * x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

This is a quadratic equation: x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x) → x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root:

x ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 → approx 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH =14-5.486=8.514, approx 8.51.

Wait, that's different! So perhaps the initial approximation was not valid, and the exact solution gives pH of around 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Ah! So why did my initial approximation give a higher pH? Because I assumed x was negligible, but perhaps in reality, it's not so small.

Wait, but if x is around 3e-6, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.019997, which is still close to 0.02, so the approximation is somewhat valid. But according to the exact solution, the pH is about 8.51.

Hmm, this suggests that the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the initial approximation, I got pH=9.02, which is higher. So where did I go wrong.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Let me re-calculate the quadratic equation.

Given Kb = 5.405e-10.

So:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

Wait, no, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) = 0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

x = [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6]/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH≈5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

So the pH is approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.51. Hmm, that's close to 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is ~8.52.

So now, looking back, the 25% titration pH is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. Which matches option A: 4.26;8.52.

But wait, I thought earlier that the equivalence pH should be around 9.02, but the exact calculation gives 8.52. So this changes things.

So why the discrepancy? Because the approximation (x<<0.02) isn't as valid as I thought. Let me check the exact solution again.

Wait, when x is 3.288e-6, which is 0.000003288 M. 0.02 M is 0.02 M. So 0.02 - x is 0.0199967 M. So the approximation is still valid. But why does the exact solution give a pH of 8.51? Because the exact solution considers the slight change, but the approximation is still close.

So perhaps the correct pH at equivalence is around 8.51, which is option A.

But wait, when I did the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach for the 25% titration, I got pH=4.26, which matches option A's first value.

So, the correct answers would be 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But why did the initial approximation give a higher pH? Because I think I miscalculated the Kb earlier. Wait, no, the Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me recheck.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question refers to the 25% of the initial solution's volume, not 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which generally refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume added.

In any case, if the calculations lead to pH=4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence, then the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid after mixing 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point by equating the moles of acetic acid to the moles of NaOH added. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
n_{\text{acetic acid}} = M \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{n_{\text{NaOH}}}{C_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{n_{\text{acetate}}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, and its hydrolysis in water can be analyzed using the \( K_b \) value. The \( K_b \) is calculated as:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the formula for weak base hydrolysis:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]},
\]

we solve for \([OH^-]\):

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] \approx -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} \approx 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, this result does not match the options provided. Revisiting the calculation, the exact quadratic solution for \([OH^-]\) yields a slightly lower pH of approximately 8.52, which aligns with option A.

For the 25% titration point, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
n_{\text{NaOH}} = C \cdot V = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
n_{\text{acetic acid remaining}} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
n_{\text{acetate}} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match option A.
