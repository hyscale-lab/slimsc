Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, sometimes it could also be from N-H, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably O-H.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which might indicate conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-7 ppm, and they appear as doublets or triplets depending on the neighboring groups. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's an alkene group in the molecule.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm not super confident with my mass spec, but I know that m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could be C3H7O, but wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for some small alcohols or ketones. Alternatively, it might be a fragment from a larger molecule. For example, CH3COO- is 60, so that's not it. Hmm, another possibility: maybe a CH2CH2O group or something else. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate the possible formula. 45 could be C3H7O (since 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59... no, that's too high. Wait, maybe C2H3O2? 2*12 +3*1 +2*16=24+3+32=59 again. No. Wait, maybe it's a fragment like CH3CH2O (45? Wait, CH3CH2O is 45? Let's see: C(12) *2 + H2 (2) *1 + O(16) = 24 + 2 +16 =42. No, that's 42. Hmm, maybe C3H5O? 3*12=36 +5=41 +16=57. No, that's 57. Wait, perhaps it's a different approach. 45 could be the molecular ion for a fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CH-O-R, then the fragment might lose R and leave a smaller ion. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the possible formulas given: the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, the molecular formulas vary in the number of carbons (all C6), H count, and O count.

Let me consider each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are 0, so (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree: could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if it's O2, perhaps an ester group, which has a carbonyl. The IR has a peak at 1700, which fits an ester (around 1740 usually, but sometimes lower if conjugated). Wait, maybe it's a conjugated ester. Also, the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe another carbonyl? Not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and something else. The presence of vinyl H's suggests at least one double bond, so another one would make sense. But what about the IR? The 1700 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone? But then, for a ketone, the IR would have a peak around 1700. But the O is only one, so perhaps a cyclic ketone, but why the broad peak at 3000? Maybe an alcohol group as well. Wait, but the formula is C6H10O, which is one O. So if there's an OH, that's one O. Then where is the carbonyl? Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group? Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So maybe a ring and a double bond. The IR has two carbonyls: 1700 and 1650. So, perhaps an ester and a ketone? Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, aromatic rings (like benzene) have their own absorption around 1450-1600, but the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with substitution. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl is from an ester (1700) and the other is from an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (so conjugated). But then, what about the O count? O2, so perhaps an ester (which has O2) and another O elsewhere? Or maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) but that's O2 as well. Wait, maybe the structure is something like a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6+2-12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. The IR has a peak at 1700, which would suggest a carbonyl group, but with only one O, that would have to be a ketone. So maybe a cyclic ketone? But then, the broad peak at 3000 would be an OH group. Wait, but that would require another O. Oh wait, the formula is C6H12O. So one O. So can't have two O-containing groups, like OH and ketone. Unless the O is in another functional group. Hmm, maybe it's an ester? No, because esters have two O's. Wait, perhaps the O is from an ether group, but that wouldn't explain the IR at 1700. So maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group. But then, the broad peak at 3000 would be from an alcohol, but that would require another O. So I'm confused here. Maybe the broad peak is not from an O-H but from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine, but the options don't include N.

Wait, let's go back. The broad peak in IR at ~3000 is very broad, so likely O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid). Carboxylic acids have very broad O-H peaks. So let's think: if the compound has a carbonyl group (from 1700) and an O-H group, then the formula must have at least two O atoms. So looking at the options, the options with O2 are A, C.

So among the options, only A and C have two O atoms. So I can eliminate B and D, which have O=1.

So now, it's between A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

The NMR shows vinyl H's, so at least one double bond (so a degree of unsaturation is used up). So in option A, which has one degree, the other would have to be a ring. In option C, which has two degrees, one is the double bond (from vinyl H), another could be a ring.

Also, the mass spec has a peak at m/z 45.

Hmm, let's think about possible structures. Let's assume the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Wait, but a carboxylic acid has a -COOH group. The IR would show a broad peak from the O-H (which matches the 3000 peak), and a strong peak around 1700 from the carbonyl. But then, the 1650 peak might be from conjugation, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with an alcohol group? But that would require more O's.

Wait, but the possible formulas are limited. Let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at 45 m/z. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, in an ester, maybe the ester group could break. Let's say the ester is something like O-CO-O-R. If the molecule breaks at the ester, perhaps the R-O-CO would form a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecular weight of the fragments could correspond to 45. Let me think about the molecular weight of the options:

Wait, the molecular weight of each option:

A) C6H12O2: 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=106.

C) C6H10O2: 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=104.

So the molecular weight is 106 (A) and 104 (C).

The mass spec shows a peak at 45. So 45 is less than both, so it's a fragment. What would cause a fragment of 45?

In esters, the cleavage can occur at the ester bond, leading to an acylium ion or an alkyl fragment. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be R-O-CO+ or R'.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3COO- which is 60 (12+1*3 +12 +16*2 +16= 12+3+12+32 +16? Wait, wait, CH3COO- is (CH3COO) which is 45? Let's see: C=12, H=1, O=16. So CH3COO: (3*12) + (3*1) + (2*16) = 36 +3 +32=71? No, that's not right. Wait, wait: CH3COO⁻ would have a charge, but the mass would be the same as the neutral. So CH3COO is 45? Let me compute: CH3COO is C2H3O2. 2*12=24, 3 H=3, 2*16=32. 24+3+32=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is C3H7O. 3*12=36 +7*1=7 +16=16. 36+7+16=59. No. Wait, 45: C3H3O? 3*12=36 +3=3 +16=16. 36+3+16=55. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternative approach: What if the fragment is (CH2)2O? That's 44 (12*2 +2 +16=24+2+16=42). No. Maybe (CH3)2O: 46 (2*12 +3*2 +16=24+6+16=46). Still not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a ketene ion? Or perhaps a different approach. Maybe the parent compound is something like an ester, and the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester is ethyl something, like O-CO-OCH2CH3. If the ester breaks, the fragment could be the R-O-CO group. Let's see, ethyl ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. If that breaks, the fragment would be O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, that's too large. Alternatively, maybe the ester oxygen breaks, giving two fragments: the acyl and the alkyl. The acyl fragment would have a molecular weight of COO group plus R. Hmm, not sure.

Another thought: the fragment at 45 could be from a ketone. For example, if the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group, but that's 58. Wait, perhaps it's a smaller fragment.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A lactone would have an ester group within a ring. So the mass spec fragment would be from the ring opening. For example, a delta-lactone (5-membered ring) would have a molecular weight that depends on the ring size. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a 45 fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have a molecular weight around 136. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the benzene ring losing certain groups. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about each option and their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. One degree of unsaturation. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. So with one degree, the other must be a ring. So structure could be a cyclic ketone with an ester? Or maybe a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two degrees. So a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl H's, one double bond is accounted for. So the other could be a ring. So maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. But then the IR peaks: 1700 for the ester, and 1650 could be the conjugated double bond (if the ester is conjugated with a double bond, the carbonyl peak might shift lower). Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring, but if it's a cyclohexene, it's not aromatic.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring's stretching, like C=C in benzene. But then the parent compound would have a benzene ring. But the options don't have C6H10O2 with a benzene ring, because benzene is C6H6. Let me see: C6H10O2 would have a benzene ring plus some substituents. For example, maybe a benzene ring with an ester group and an ethylene group, but that would require more H. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the 1650 peak is from conjugated carbonyl groups. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. The carbonyl would be at 1700, and the conjugated double bond would cause the peak to shift down to around 1650. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group. But then the degrees of unsaturation would be two (a double bond and the carbonyl). So in the formula, that would account for two degrees.

Wait, let's check the degrees for option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So yes, two degrees. So a double bond (from the vinyl H's) and a carbonyl group (ester or ketone). But the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. That fits.

So, in the IR, the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

So the structure might be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOO-R. Let's count the carbons. If R is methyl, then it's CH2=CHCOOCH3. That's C5H8O2. But our options have C6. So R would be a methyl group, but wait, that's C4 total? Or perhaps the R is ethyl. Let me think: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2- something? Wait, maybe the structure is more like R-OOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, the ester could be part of a ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, the structure is a cyclic ester, but that would require a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like methyl vinyl ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3? Let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons (CH2, CH, COO), and the ester's R is CH2CH3, which is 2 carbons. So 4+2=6. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's compute: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula is C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

So the NMR would have vinyl protons, which aligns with the presence of the double bond. The IR shows the ester carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond at 1650.

What about the mass spec fragment at 45? Let's think. If the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, the mass would be (30 for CH2=CHCOO) + (46 for CH2CH3O)? Wait, maybe when it fragments, it could lose the ethyl group, leaving the CH2=CHCOO group. But the molecular weight of that is 72 (12*6=72, but wait that's not right. Let me calculate: CH2=CHCOO has 4 carbons. So 4*12=48, plus H: CH2=CHCOO would have 4*2=8 H? Wait, let's calculate the molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO^- (if it forms an ion). CH2=CHCOO has 4 carbons, 5 H (because CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO has 2 oxygens but H would be 2 from CH2 and 1 from CH, so 3 H?), no, wait I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group breaking. The ester group (O-CO-O) could break, leading to a fragment of the acyl group. For CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, the acyl part is CH2=CHCOO. Its molecular weight would be (2 carbons from CH2=CH) + 2 (COO) = 4 carbons? Wait, no: CH2=CHCOO is three carbons (CH2, CH, COO). So 3 carbons: 3*12=36, plus H: CH2 has 2 H, CH has 2 (but double bond, so perhaps only one?), and COO has no H. Wait, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion, which would have a molecular weight of 58 (CH2=CHCOO+ would be 4*12 + 5*1 + 2*16 = 48 +5 +32=85? No, that's not 45. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Its molecular weight is 58. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COOH (60), but that's also not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the ethyl group. The ethyl group is 46 (C2H5). But that's 46, which is close to 45. Maybe it's a different fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester has a different structure, like a propyl ester. Hmm, but I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Let me think about the other clues.

The presence of an O-H group (from the broad IR peak at 3000) suggests that the compound has an -OH group. But wait, in option C, the formula is C6H10O2. That would require, for example, an ester and an alcohol group. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation are two: one for the double bond, another for the ring or another double bond. So perhaps the structure is an allyl alcohol with an ester group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a diol, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could be from an alcohol, and the 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups. But that would require two O's, which is accounted for in options A and C.

Wait, options A and C have O2. So in option A, C6H12O2: could that structure have both an ester and an alcohol group? But then, the degrees of unsaturation are only one. Because one degree used by the ester (which is a carbonyl, one double bond, so that's one degree?), wait no, ester is a carbonyl (one degree) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol group. But again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formula and possible functional groups.

Option C
