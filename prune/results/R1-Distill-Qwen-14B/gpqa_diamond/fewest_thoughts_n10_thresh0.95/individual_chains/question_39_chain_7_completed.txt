Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Also, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait, that's a complex function because of the i term. So the wave function is a complex number. That's a bit more complicated than the simple real wave functions we usually deal with in basic problems.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write this as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-i/2). Hmm, that would be the same as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - (i/2). 

Wait, but the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because outside that region, the particle isn't found, so maybe the wave function is zero outside that interval? Or perhaps the way it's written, the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the given expression doesn't include a step function or anything. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. That would make sense because the measurements only found particles in that region.

Wait, but the way the wave function is given, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe that's valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So when integrating for normalization, we consider only x from 1 to 3.

So to find the normalization, we compute the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ is a complex function, the square of its absolute value is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

So ψ(x) = A - (i/2), where A = a/(sqrt(1+x)).

The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be A + (i/2).

So |ψ(x)|² = (A - i/2)(A + i/2) = A² + (i/2)(-i/2) + ... Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Multiplying (A - i/2)(A + i/2) = A^2 + (i/2)A - (i/2)A - (i/2)(i/2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me expand it properly.

(A - i/2)(A + i/2) = A² + (A)(i/2) - (i/2)A - (i/2)(i/2).

Wait, wait. Alternatively, it's (A - i/2)(A + i/2) = A² + (A)(i/2) + (-i/2)(A) + (-i/2)(i/2).

Wait, no, another approach. Remember that (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So here, a is A, and b is i/2. So,

|ψ(x)|² = A² - (i/2)^2.

But (i/2)^2 = (i²)/(4) )= (-1)/4. So,

|ψ(x)|² = A² - (-1/4) = A² + 1/4.

So,

|ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 1/4.

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 1/4] dx must equal 1.

Let me write that integral:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 1/4] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ [1/(1+x)] dx + (1/4) ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2. So (1/4)*2 = 1/2.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 1/2 = 1.

Subtract 1/2 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So a² = (1/2) / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So,

a² = (0.5) / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that. Let's compute sqrt(0.7213).

Hmm, sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the value of a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, a² = (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which is roughly 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Did I correctly compute the square of the absolute value?

Yes, because |A - i/2|^2 is A² + (1/2)^2, since (i/2)(-i/2) = 1/4.

So, yes, |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 1/4.

The integral from 1 to 3 of that is correct.

Another thing: Does the wave function have any constraints elsewhere? The problem states that when measured, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function should be zero outside that interval, but inside it's given by that expression. So the normalization is only considering the interval from 1 to 3.

Wait, but looking back at the wave function expression given in the problem: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Are we sure that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3? Because if the wave function is defined as that expression but is zero elsewhere, we have to account for that. But in the problem statement, it says that in a part of space where the particle can exist, the wave function is that. So, yes, it's only non-zero between 1 and 3.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, a ≈ 0.85, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - \frac{i}{2}.
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. This means:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \), where \( \psi^*(x) \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \). 

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + \frac{i}{2}.
\]

Multiplying \( \psi(x) \) and \( \psi^*(x) \):

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization integral
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + \frac{1}{4}\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \frac{1}{4} \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the integrals
1. Compute \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \):
   \[
   \int \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| + C.
   \]
   Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):
   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. Compute \( \int_{1}^{3} dx \):
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
   \]

Substitute these results back into the equation:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]

Subtract \( \frac{1}{2} \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( a \)
\[
a^2 = \frac{1/2}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85.
\]

### Final Answer
The numerical value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
