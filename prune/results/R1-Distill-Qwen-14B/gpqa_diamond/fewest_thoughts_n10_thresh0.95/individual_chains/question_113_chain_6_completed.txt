Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's take it step by step.

Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all involving C6H with varying O and H counts. 

Let's start by looking at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, right? Also, if it's an alcohol, the peak might be broader, but maybe not as broad as a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but sometimes alcohols can have broad peaks too. So that's one clue.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, those are important. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I'm pretty sure is a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, what could that be? Maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. That might be from conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, an acid's C=O is around 1700, but if there's conjugation, it might lower it a bit. Or maybe it's an ester or something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere—either in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. Since the options don't include any aromatic options (they're all C6H with O's), wait no, C6 could be a ring. But let's think: if it's aromatic, the H would show up in certain regions. But the presence of vinyl H's suggests maybe an alkene, not necessarily aromatic. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. I think that's the tropylium ion (C7H7+ is 91, but maybe not). Wait, 45 is the mass of something else. Let me think: 45 could be CH3CO+ (acetyl group, which is 43, but wait 43 is 45? Wait, CH3CO+ would be (12*2 +1*3 +16) = 24 +3 +16=43? No, wait, 12 for C, 1 for H, 16 for O. So CH3CO+ is (2*12) + (3*1) + 16 = 24 +3 +16 = 43. Hmm, 44 is CO2+, but that's 44. Alternatively, 45 could be CH2COOH+? Or maybe a different fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion or something else. Wait, another possibility: in mass spectrometry, the molecular ion breaks into fragments. For example, if the molecule has a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone, maybe a fragment would lose a part of the molecule. For example, if the compound is something like methyl acrylate, the fragment might break off the ester part.

Now, considering all this, let's think about the possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Wait, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Let me calculate each option.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

Option A: C6H12O2.
C=6, H=12, O=2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2= 2/2=1.

So 1 DoU could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option B: C6H10O.
DoU= (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

So two DoU: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

Option C: C6H10O2.
DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O.
DoU= (14-12)/2= 1.

So structures with one DoU.

Looking back at the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so at least one DoU). So the possible options with at least one DoU are all except... no, wait, all options have at least one DoU because:

Option D: 1 DoU. So if it's a single ring, but no double bonds, then the vinyl H wouldn't be present. So the presence of vinyl H suggests there's a double bond, so the compound must have at least one DoU from a double bond or ring. But wait, in option D, DoU=1: that could be a ring with no double bond, but that wouldn't give vinyl H. So options with more than one DoU would be better. So looking, options B, C have DoU=2. That could be a ring plus a double bond, which would make sense for having vinyl H.

Wait, but option A and D have DoU=1. So if the compound has a double bond (vinyl H), then options B and C are possible. So that narrows it down to B or C.

Now, looking back at the IR. The 1700 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group. So, if it's an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid.

If it's an ester, the formula would have O2, because esters are RCOOR', which have two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, options A and C have two O's. Options B and D have one O.

So if the carbonyl is part of an ester, that would point to A or C.

But wait, the IR also has a broad peak at 3000, which I thought could be O-H. If it's an ester, where would O-H come from? Esters don't have O-H unless it's an ester with an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, wait, no, I think I confused something. Esters typically don't have O-H groups, unless it's a hemiacetal or something, but that's not common. So if the FTIR has a broad O-H peak, that suggests the presence of an O-H group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl (1700) and an O-H (broad peak) can suggest a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid has both a carbonyl and an O-H group. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have at least two O's (since RCOOH has two O's in the COOH group). So options with O2 are A and C.

Hmm, but option C has O2 and H10, which would be a formula C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group. But that's less likely; esters are more about O-C-O structures. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone with an alcohol, but that would be less likely to have both a strong carbonyl and a broad O-H.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a beta-keto ester or something similar. For example, ethyl acetoacetate. That would have both the ester carbonyl and a ketone. Wait, no, that's a single carbonyl. Alternatively, let's think about structure.

But perhaps the presence of both O-H and carbonyl suggests a carboxylic acid. So the O-H (broad) and the 1700 could be the carboxylic acid group.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2: for example, C6H12O2 (like hexanoic acid would be C6H12O2), but wait hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH, which is C6H12O2.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have the O-H peak as a broad peak, but in the 1H NMR, the question says there are several peaks including vinyl. So hexanoic acid wouldn't have any vinyl H. So that suggests that the compound isn't a simple carboxylic acid but has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH), which has a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. That would fit the IR: broad O-H at 3000 (carboxylic acid), strong carbonyl at 1700, and maybe another peak from conjugation at 1650.

Wait, but what about the NMR? Acrylic acid has vinyl Hs (the CH2=CH- group). So that would match the NMR data. So that's a possibility.

But let's get back to the options. The options with O2 are A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). Let's see.

If the formula is C6H12O2, that would imply degrees of unsaturation= (2*6 +2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1 DoU. So one ring or one double bond.

But if the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H's in NMR) plus a ring, that would require two DoU. But option A has only one DoU. So that's not possible. So perhaps option C is more likely.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So that could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But wait, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about the possible fragments. For a molecule with a formula of C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16) =72+10+32=114 g/mol. So the molecular ion would be at m/z=114. But the fragment is at 45.

Hmm, what fragment would give 45? Let's think about possible ions. 45 is 45. Let's try to think of a group that adds up to 45. 45 could be:

- CH3CO+ (43, but not 45)
Wait, 45 is 45. Let's think of 45 as the mass of a fragment. Let me compute:

45 = (12a + 1b + 16c). Let's think:

Option 1: 45 = 12*3 +1*3 + 16*0 → 39+3=42 → nope.

Option 2: 12*2 +1*3 +16*1=24+3+16=43 → nope.

Wait, 12*3 +1*3 +16*0=42 → no.

Wait, 12*1 +1*9 +16*1=12+9+16=37 → no.

Wait, 45 is C3H9O? No, because 3*12=36, 9 H is 9, O is 16 → 36+9+16=61. No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different composition. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment without oxygen. 45 could be C3H7+? 3*12=36, 7 H is 7 → 36+7=43, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CO group. Wait, 12+16=28, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2COOH group. Let's see: CH2COOH is C2H4O2.

Wait, the mass of CH2COOH: (2*12)+(4*1)+(2*16)=24 +4 +32=60, which is higher than 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible structure of the compound.

If the compound is an ester, the formula could be something like RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.

Esters have the formula CnH2nO2. Wait, no—wait, for an ester RCOOR', the formula would be (R is m carbons, R' is n carbons) Cm+1+n H2(m+n+1) O2.

Wait, for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. So the formula is C4H8O2.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. If that's an ester, then m+n+1=6. So m and n are such that m +n +1=6 → m +n =5.

Possible combinations: m=3, n=2 → RCOOR', where R is propyl (3 carbons) and R' is ethyl (2 carbons). So the ester would be propanoate ethyl ester or something. Wait, no: R is the acyl group, so R is propyl would make the acyl group propanoyl (COO). So the ester would be something like ethyl propanoate: CH2CH2OOCCH2CH2CH3. But wait, the formula would be C5H10O2, but our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl something. For example, the ester could be methyl pentanoate: CH3OOC(CH2)3CH3. That would be C6H12O2. Which is option A. But option A has a molecular formula of C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So if it's an ester, methyl pentanoate would have a formula C6H12O2, and DoU=1, which would be a single ester group and no double bonds. But the NMR has vinyl Hs, which suggests a double bond. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so maybe it's not an ester but a different structure. Let's think again about the IR.

If the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is O-H, but the carbonyl is at 1700, perhaps it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group. Like a ketone with an alcohol, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyl chloride, but those usually have strong peaks around 1800 and don't have O-H.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a beta-keto ester. For example, something like ethyl acetoacetate, which is (CH3CO)CH2COOEt. Its structure has two carbonyl groups: one ketone and one ester. But in that case, the IR would show two strong carbonyl peaks. But in the given data, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that would fit.

But the molecular formula of ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3. That's not among the options. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then the formula would be different.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures for C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are two, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound is a diene with an ester group, that could fit. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate? No, that's more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have a formula C6H10O2. Let me compute: The structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's (CH2=CHCOO-) and (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no, that would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula is:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So combined, it's C6H11O2. Wait, no: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2 (since the double bond reduces two H's). Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond elsewhere, but that might complicate things.

Hmm. Let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45. If the molecule breaks into a fragment that's 45, perhaps it's a CH2COO- group, but that's 43. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. For option C: C6H10O2.

If we assume it's an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, but that's for the ester RCOOR', where R is (n-1) carbons and R' is m carbons, so total is n + m +1.

Wait, maybe let's consider possible esters. For example, methyl hexanoate would be C7H14O2. No, that's too big.

Wait, perhaps an ester with a double bond. For example, a vinyl ester. Let's say the ester is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that's not getting me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again. For C6H10O2: DoU is 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound has a carbonyl group (like an ester) and a double bond, that would account for two DoU. So that fits.

So the structure might be something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's probably not the right approach.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible structures again.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a carbonyl and a double bond might lead to a conjugated dienone or something else. But perhaps in the spectrum, the 1650 cm^-1 peak could be due to conjugation between the carbonyl and the double bond, lowering the carbonyl frequency.

So, the compound could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, something like cyclohexenone, which is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. But cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Let me check: C6H10O would be option B. DoU is 2.

But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak, perhaps around 1700. And if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the conjugation would lower the carbonyl frequency to around 1680-1650 cm^-1. So that would match the two peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, no—wait, cyclohexenone would have a single carbonyl, so why two peaks? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the compound could have two carbonyl groups, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be from two different carbonyl groups. For example, an ester and a ketone. But that would require a more complex structure.

If the compound has both an ester group (1700) and another carbonyl, like a conjugated ketone (1650), that might fit. But then the molecular formula would have more oxygen atoms. Let's see, an ester has O2, so O2 is accounted for. If there's another carbonyl group, like a ketone, that's another O, making it O3. But none of the options have O3. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a substituent. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, a lactone would have a ring structure where an ester is formed. For example, a five-membered ring lactone would be gamma-butyrolactone, but that's four-membered. Alternatively, a six-membered lactone would have the formula C5H8O2. But our compound is C6H10O2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's say the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, let's calculate:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is CH2=CHCOO- (which is C3H4O2) plus CH2CH2CH3 (which is C3H7). So combined, that's C6H11O2. Wait, that's one more H than option C, which is C6H10O2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's too long. Alternatively, maybe it's a shorter chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond elsewhere. But that's getting a bit too complicated.

Hmm, maybe I should focus back on the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. What compounds have a fragment that weighs 45?

Looking up common fragments, I remember that the acetyl group (CH3CO+) is 43, but that's not 45. Another possibility is the ethyl group (C2H5+) which is 29. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl. For example, a ketene ion (R-C-O+) would have a certain mass. The ketene ion (like CH2=C=O) has a mass of 44 (12*2 +1*2 +16= 24+2+16=42? Wait, no: CH2=C=O would have a molecular mass of (12*3)+(2*1)+(16) =36 +2 +16=54. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like CH2COOH, but that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a tropylium ion. The tropylium ion is C7H7+, which has a mass of 91. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from a CH3COO- group losing something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a benzene ring, but the question doesn't mention any aromatic protons in the NMR, so I think it's more likely an alkene.

Wait, another approach: for the molecular formula C6H10O2, the possible structures could be an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a 1700 cm^-1 peak (carbonyl) and a 1650 (maybe another group, like an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond). But earlier I thought the 1650 could be conjugation with the carbonyl.

Another thought: the compound could have a conjugated dienone system, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a vinyl acetate. Vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. Its formula would be C4H6O2. But our compound is C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the molecular formula and possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Let me think of possible functional groups: ester and a double bond.

So, for example, ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Its formula is C5H8O2. Not matching.

Alternatively, propyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Yes! That fits. So the formula is C6H10O2.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's see:

- The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester) at ~1700 cm^-1. The conjugated double bond (CH2=CHCOO-) might lower the carbonyl frequency a bit, maybe to 1680 or so. But in the question, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from the C=C stretching.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: esters have carbonyl around 1700-1750. The C=C in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would absorb around 1650. So that fits the two strong peaks in IR.

The FTIR would show a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. Wait, but in this structure, there's no O-H group. So why is there a broad peak at 3000? That's a problem because if the structure is an ester, it wouldn't have O-H. So that would contradict the FTIR data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's say something like CH2=CHCOOH. Its formula is C3H4O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's a hexenoic acid. Let's say CH2=CH(CH2)3COOH. Formula would be C6H10O2. That fits option C.

In that case:

- FTIR: broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid) at ~3000 cm^-1.

- Strong carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1.

- Conjugated double bond (CH2=CH-) could lead to a peak around 1650 cm^-1.

- 1H NMR would show vinyl H's (the CH2=CH- group).

- Mass spec: the fragment at 45 might come from something like the COOH losing some parts. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the CH2=CH group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but for hex-2-enoic acid (CH2CH2COOHCH2CH2CH2?), no, that's not right. Let me think: the correct structure for a hexenoic acid with a double bond would be CH2=CH(CH2)3COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2. Yes.

In that structure, the IR would show O-H (carboxylic acid) as a broad peak, the carbonyl, and the C=C as conjugated peaks.

The NMR would show the vinyl H's.

The mass spec would have a fragment at m/z=45. Maybe the COOH group breaks off, but that's around 60 (COOH is 45? Wait, COOH is 12+16+16+1=45? Wait, no, COOH is actually O2, so the formula for the COOH group is C1H2O2. Its m/z is 45. So if the molecule breaks off as COOH, that would give a peak at 45. But wait, the COOH has a molecular weight of 45? Let me compute:

COOH group is -COOH, which is C=O-OH. The molecular weight is 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) + another H? Wait, no. The formula for -COOH is C1H2O2. So 12 +2 +32=46. Hmm, but that's 46. But the fragment is at 45. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COO+ (43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, maybe it's more likely to lose a part of the molecule. For example, for ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt), the molecular ion could break into the acrylate part. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the vinyl group. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has a molecular weight of 26 (12*2 +1*4=24+4=28?), which doesn't fit 45.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion is at m/z=114.

Looking for a fragment at 45, which is about 40% of the molecular weight. So maybe the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45 and another part of 69 (114-45=69). So what could 45 be?

Wait, 45 could be the mass of the COO- group. COO- has a mass of 44 (12 + 16*2 =44). So if the molecule breaks to lose part of it, perhaps the COO- group remains as a fragment. So the fragment would be at 44, but the question says 45. Close, but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe it's the CH2COO- group, which is 43 (12*2 +16*2 +1*3=24+32+3=59? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COO-, which is 43.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a tropylium ion, but that's 91.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a diethyl maleate or something similar. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, I'm kind of stuck. Let's think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU=1.

B) C6H10O → DoU=2.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

D) C6H12O → DoU=1.

We've concluded that the presence of vinyl Hs and a carbonyl suggests DoU of at least 2, which leaves options B and C.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H, which suggests an -OH group, so the compound must have at least one O-H, which would mean the formula must include O2. Because if it's an alcohol (O1), the broad O-H would fit, but then the carbonyl would be another O, making it O2. So options with O2 are A and C.

But option A has DoU=1, which can't account for the vinyl Hs (as it would require a double bond, adding another DoU). So option C is the only one left with O2 and DoU=2.

So the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be due to conjugation with a double bond.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) suggest the presence of an alkene group.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This could correspond to a fragment such as CH3COO⁺ (43) or a related group, though exact identification is unclear.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C6H12O2**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This suggests a single ring or double bond, which does not account for the vinyl hydrogens observed in the NMR.
   - **B) C6H10O**: DoU = 2. This could represent a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, it only contains one oxygen atom, which does not match the FTIR data showing both O-H and carbonyl groups.
   - **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 2. This could represent a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. The two oxygen atoms align with the presence of both an O-H group and a carbonyl group.
   - **D) C6H12O**: DoU = 1. Similar to option A, this does not account for the vinyl hydrogens.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a broad O-H peak, a carbonyl group, and vinyl hydrogens strongly supports the formula **C6H10O2** (option C). This formula satisfies the degrees of unsaturation, accounts for the observed functional groups, and aligns with the mass spectrometry data.
