Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when they say 'excited', I think they're referring to the number of atoms in a particular energy level. So, the excitation level relates to the population of the energy states.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels as a function of temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Wait, wait—actually, I think it's n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), assuming E_i > E_j. Or is it the other way around? Because higher energy states have lower populations. So if the energy level of star_1 is higher, or the difference is such that the population is lower, but here star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. Wait, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific level. So, which energy level are we talking about? Let me clarify.

Suppose the energy difference between two levels is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. So the atoms can be in a lower energy level (ground state) or an excited state. The ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for each star, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait—the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So, I think it's the number of excited atoms (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or is it the ratio of n_upper to n_total or something else?

Wait, no, I think the problem states that the specific energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So, n_upper for star_1 is 2 times n_upper for star_2, perhaps? Or maybe n_upper_1 / n_upper_2 = 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 is twice the ratio n_upper_2 / n_lower_2. Hmm, no, because each star's ratio would depend on their own temperatures.

Wait, let me clarify the setup. The energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's a specific energy level. So ΔE = E2 - E1, just a fixed number.

Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star_1 and T2 as that of star_2.

So, for star_1, n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Hmm, does this mean that n_upper_1 = 2 * n_upper_2? Or is it (n_upper_1)/(n_upper_2) = 2? Or is it the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2?

I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being compared. Let me think again.

I think the correct interpretation is that the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms (n_upper / n_lower) is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2. So,

(n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2)

But wait, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe n_upper_1 is twice n_upper_2. No, because the star's own temperature affects the ratio, so the upper levels depend on both the temperature and the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the ratio for each star is each as a function of their own temperature. So, for star_1, (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), and the problem says that this ratio is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2.

Wait, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, perhaps (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2).

Wait, or maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But no, that doesn't make sense because the number of atoms depends on the star's size and other factors, which aren't given. So, probably, the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms is twice as large in star_1.

So, let's set up the equation.

Let me denote x1 = n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, x2 = n_upper_2 / n_lower_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that x1 = 2 * x2.

So,

x1 = 2 x2

Substituting the expressions,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify the left side:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which becomes:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation.

Bring terms involving T to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, wait, because 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

I can write this as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But I think I can rearrange the equation without the constants. Let me write the equation again.

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

Let me go back to the earlier step.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which gives:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

But I think I can also write this as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

Hmm, but the question is asking for which equation correctly gives the relationship between T1 and T2.

Looking at the options, I can see that option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but wait a second. Let me see.

Wait, in our equation, we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, and k is Boltzmann's constant (approx 1.38e-23 J/K). So substituting, k * ln(2) / ΔE would be (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln(2) ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) / K * K → 1/K * K → 1? Wait, no, let me compute:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J

So,

(k ln(2)) / ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K * ln 2 ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = (ln 2) / K * K cancels → ln 2.

Wait, no: wait, [k ln(2)] / ΔE
