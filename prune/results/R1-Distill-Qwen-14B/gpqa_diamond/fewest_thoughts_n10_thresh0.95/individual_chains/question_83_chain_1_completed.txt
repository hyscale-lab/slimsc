Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about titrating a solution of acetic acid with NaOH. So, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. They dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to pick the correct pair.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and they add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. Wait, but I remember that molarity is moles per liter. So, the moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume in liters. 

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So, the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. We're looking at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. 

Wait, so the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles (as calculated earlier). The NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH = 0.1 * V, where V is in liters. At equivalence, 0.1 * V = 0.001 => V = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So, at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point? Or 25% of the initial acetic acid? Hmm, I think it's 25% of the equivalence volume. Because in titration, when they say 25% titration, it usually refers to the volume of titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think in moles. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of that required volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Alternatively, in terms of moles, 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, let me calculate each scenario.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), because NaOH is a strong base and reacts completely with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. The solution will consist of sodium acetate (which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base) dissolved in water. Sodium ions are spectator ions, so the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The concentration of acetate will be the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume. Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is very small, so the hydrolysis will produce a small amount of OH^- ions. The concentration of OH^- can be approximated by sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of acetate. So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48. So pH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52. Wait, but wait, that would be an option. Let me check the options: option A says 4.26;8.52. So the equivalence pH would be 8.52 in that scenario.

But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me calculate the equivalence point pH correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the exact calculation. Let's set up the Kb expression.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] 

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 since x is very small. So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6. pOH is -log(3.29e-6) = about 5.48, so pH is about 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says the equivalence is 8.52, and option D says 6.92. So if the equivalence pH is 8.52, the first part of the answer would be 8.52, but let me make sure.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the initial solution after dilution was 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, at equivalence point, all of that is neutralized, and we have 0.02 M acetate.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is phrased: we diluted 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So that gives a 0.025 M solution, correct.

But when we titrate, the volume of solution increases as we add NaOH. At equivalence point, the volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³, making the concentration of acetate 0.02 M.

So, the pH at equivalence is around 8.52. So in the options, only option A and D have equivalence points as 8.52 and 6.92, respectively.

But wait, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, but where would the 6.92 come from? I'm not sure yet. Let's think about the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the required NaOH volume has been added. The required volume is 10 cm³, so 2.5 cm³ added. So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

So, the solution now has both acetic acid and acetate ions. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 liters.

The concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 1e-5. Log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa is about 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.4771.

So pH ≈ 4.733 -0.4771 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So the pH at 25% titration is about 4.26.

Looking back at the options, option A says pH is 4.26 and 8.52. That matches the calculations. But wait, let me double-check. Another way to compute could involve exact calculation without approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH at 25% titration without assuming x is negligible.

Wait, but in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the approximation holds because the ratio is 1/3, and the pKa is around 4.73, so the calculation seems correct.

So the 25% titration pH is approximately 4.26, and the equivalence pH is 8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but looking back, another approach for the equivalence point: perhaps the solution is more dilute than I thought. So the initial moles were 0.001, and equivalence is when all is neutralized. But when you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles are indeed 0.001, so it's correct. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe another way: perhaps the volume isn't 50 cm³ but more. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and adding 10 cm³ brings it to 50 cm³. So yes, 0.05 L.

Wait, but another thing: when you add strong base to a weak acid, the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which is a basic solution, so pH>7. So 8.52 is correct.

So the pair is 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92  

So, option A's first pH is 4.26, which matches, but wait, the second value is 8.52. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing: when I calculated the 25% titration, I did the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, moles of acetate is 0.00025, and acetic acid is 0.00075. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477, which gives pH =4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256, so 4.26. That's correct.

So the first pH is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So only option A matches. However, I'm a bit confused because another approach for the equivalence point could be different.

Wait another thought: when you make the diluted solution, you're adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So the initial moles are 0.05 ×0.02 = 0.001 moles. Diluting to 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, but when you titrate, the initial volume is 40 cm³, so when you add V mL of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + V mL. So for the equivalence, V is 10 mL, total volume 50 mL. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the Kb is 5.405e-10. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]. Let me set up the equation more precisely.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. Let x be [OH^-]. So the reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb equation:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6, pOH is about 5.48, pH is 8.52. Correct.

But wait, what if I didn't make that assumption? Let's solve without approximation:

x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10

Assume x is about 3.29e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So everything seems correct. Thus, the correct answer is option A: 4.26 and 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated below), so 25% corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are 0.00025. The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(approximately 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \ll [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \), the hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct option is:

**Answer: A**
