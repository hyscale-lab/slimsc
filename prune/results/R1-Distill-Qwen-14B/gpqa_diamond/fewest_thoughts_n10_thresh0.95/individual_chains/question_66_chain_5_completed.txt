Okay, so I'm looking at this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. Now, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these symmetries entails and whether they're part of the SMEFT framework.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a given because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built as an effective theory, so all the operators must be compatible with the SM symmetries, including Lorentz. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the Standard Model includes translations (it's a local symmetry), I think SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare would be required.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that the SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM includes Poincare, SMEFT would too. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry? I'm not so sure. I think the Standard Model doesn't have a global CP symmetry that's exact because there are sources of CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, would SMEFT require operators to preserve it? I don't think so. So CP symmetry might not be a required symmetry for SMEFT operators. So option 3 is probably not correct.

What about CPT symmetry? Oh right, the Standard Model does respect CPT symmetry, and I think that's a fundamental requirement for any Lorentz-invariant theory. Because in quantum field theory, CPT is a big deal. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting that together: which symmetries must be respected? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an effective theory that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it as part of its framework.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not have an exact global CP symmetry due to sources of CP violation, such as in the CKM matrix. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and this is a fundamental requirement for any Lorentz-invariant theory. Thus, CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination of these symmetries is given in option C.

Answer: C
