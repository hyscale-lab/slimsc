Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Because there are only dx and dy terms. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, I remember that the area of a sphere in Euclidean space is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Oh wait, no, pseudosphere is more like a tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric here?

Wait, the metric given might be that of a space with constant curvature. Let me see. The standard metric for a space with constant curvature has a specific form. For example, in two dimensions, the metric for a space with curvature k can be written as ds² = dr² + (a²/k) (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the forms for spherical and hyperbolic coordinates.

Alternatively, the metric might be conformally flat, as it is here. The given metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar function times (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, the area element in 2D is usually dA = (1/(g)) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But in this case, since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². But since both are multiplied by the same factor, the determinant will be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which in this case would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Wait, g is the determinant, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², so sqrt(g) would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)], because 32 is positive. So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, radius is 2. Wait, what's the relationship between the metric and the radius of the pseudosphere?

I think the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of its curvature. Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents a space with constant curvature. Let me think: the given metric is in 2D, but a pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in 3D. Oh wait, the question might be treating the pseudosphere as a 2D surface with certain properties.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is for the 2D surface of the pseudosphere. So, in that case, what's the area? The area would be the integral of the area element over the entire surface. So I need to compute the double integral of dA over all x and y where the metric is defined.

But the denominator in the metric is (4 - x² - y²). So the condition is that 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, and the metric would have issues (like singularities). So the domain of x and y is the set where x² + y² < 4. Because if x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero, which is a problem, so the maximum allowed is 4.

Wait, so the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, since switching to polar coordinates would make this easier. Because dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (r dr dθ)²? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = r² dr² + r² dθ² = r² (dr² + dθ²), but that's not correct. Wait, wait, no: dx² + dy² in polar is (dr)^2 + (r dθ)^2. So the area element would be (1/(g)) dx dy, but wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant. The determinant of the metric tensor in polar coordinates—wait, in 2D, the metric tensor would be diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4-r²))^2 dr² r² dθ²? No, wait, the determinant is simply (32/(4 - r²))^2 times (dr dθ terms?), but perhaps I should think of the metric in terms of components.

Wait, in 2D, the metric tensor is:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = [32 r²]/(4 - r²)
g_rθ = g_θr = 0.

Wait, no, wait: because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the given metric is (32/(4−r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the metric tensor components are:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²)
g_rθ = g_θr = 0.

The determinant of this metric is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32)^2 r²/(4 - r²)^2.

The area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. So sqrt( (32)^2 r²/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) = 32 r / (4 - r²).

So dA = [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since r² <4, so r goes up to 2), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the integral is:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that. First, the integral over θ is just 2π. So:

Area = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32 r/(u)] * (r dr) → but wait, I need to express r dr in terms of du.

Wait, I have [32 r/(u)] dr. Since r dr = (-du)/2. So:

32 r/(u) dr = 32 (-du)/(2u) ) = -16 du / u.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) * (1/u) du.

But when I flip the limits from 4 to 0 to 0 to 4, the negative sign cancels, so it becomes:

16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

Wait, but integrating 1/u from 0 to4 is ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral would diverge. That suggests that the area is infinite.

Wait, that would mean the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Or is that not the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The given metric is 

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Which in polar coordinates is [32/(4−r²)] ( dr² + r² dθ² ).

Wait, if this is the metric of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, then the area should be finite. So why am I getting an infinite area here?

Wait, perhaps the metric given is not of a compact surface but an infinite one. Because in the case of a pseudosphere, which is a tractricoid, it's a finite area surface. But if the integral is diverging, which would imply infinite area, that suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the area integral ∫∫ dA is diverging, which would mean the area is infinite. But the options include D) +infty, so that's a possible answer.

Wait, but why would this be the case? Let me think about the metric again. The denominator is (4−r²). So as r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero, and the area element becomes large. So near r=2, the area element blows up, leading to an infinite area.

So does that mean that the surface area is infinite? But a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the model. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane extends infinitely, so its area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is specifically about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the given metric is not of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic space, which would have infinite area. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me double-check the area integral calculation.

The integral is ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute it again without substitution.

Let me make u =4 - r². Then du= -2r dr → r dr= -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = ∫ [32/(u)] * (r dr) = ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) )= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

When r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0 of (-16/u) du. Flipping the limits, it's 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Which is 16 [ln(4) - ln(0)] → but ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to positive infinity.

So the area is infinite.

So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, why is the pseudosphere of radius 2 having infinite area? No, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite surface. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric is given in terms of a coordinate system that only covers a part of the pseudosphere, leading to an infinite area. Alternatively, maybe the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere but another surface.

Wait, but the question says "consider the following metric" and asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the metric corresponds to a pseudosphere of radius 2. If the calculation leads to infinite area, but the options include D) +infty, that would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the metric and the radius of curvature.

Wait, the pseudosphere has a constant negative Gaussian curvature. In the metric, the Gaussian curvature can be computed. Maybe that will help.

I remember that for a metric conformally flat in 2D, ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by -e^{-2λ} (Δλ), where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D.

In this case, λ is (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)). So e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - r²).

So Δλ is the Laplacian of (1/2 ln (32/(4 - r²)) ).

Wait, in polar coordinates, the Laplacian of a function f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

So f(r) = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) ) = (1/2)(ln 32 - ln(4 - r²)).

df/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (1/2) [ (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = r/(4 - r²).

Then, r df/dr = r * [ r/(4 - r²) ) ] = r²/(4 - r²).

d/dr (r df/dr ) = d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ 2r (4 - r²) + r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. Using the quotient rule:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) ) + r² ( 2r ) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, denominator is (4−r²)², numerator is 2r (4−r²) + 2r³.

Expanding numerator: 2r *4 =8r; 2r*(-r²)= -2r^3; plus 2r^3. So:

8r - 2r^3 + 2r^3 = 8r.

So the derivative is 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian Δλ = (1/r) * [8r/(4 - r²)^2 ] = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Gaussian curvature K is -e^{-2λ} * Δλ.

e^{-2λ} is the inverse of 32/(4 - r²) ), so (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ] = - [8 (4 - r²)] / [32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator.

8 and 32 are factors: 8/32 = 1/4.

(4 - r²) in numerator and denominator: (4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = 1/(4 - r²).

So K = - [ (1/4) * (1/(4 - r²)) ) ] = -1/(4(4 - r²)).

Hmm, that's not constant. Wait, but I thought a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. Did I make a mistake in calculating the Gaussian curvature?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when I computed df/dr, I had f(r) = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r^2)).

So df/dr = (1/2) [ (0) - ( (-2r)/(4 - r^2) ) ] = (1/2) * (2r)/(4 - r²) )= r/(4−r²).

That's correct.

Then, r df/dr = r * [r/(4−r²)] = r²/(4−r²).

d/dr [ r df/dr ] = d/dr [ r²/(4−r²) ) ].

Using the quotient rule: numerator is 2r (4−r²) + r² (2r) → wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, the derivative of r² is 2r, and derivative of denominator is -2r. So applying quotient rule:

d/dr [r²/(4−r²)] = [ (2r)(4−r²) + r²*(2r) ] / (4−r²)^2.

Wait, no, the denominator's derivative is -2r, so:

= [ (2r)(4−r²) ) + r² * (2r) ] / (4−r²)^2.

Wait, no, wait: the quotient rule is [num' * den - num * den'] / den^2.

Wait, num is r², so num’ = 2r.

Den is (4−r²), so den’ = -2r.

So,

d/dr [r²/(4−r²)] = [ (2r)(4−r²) ) - r²*(-2r) ] / (4−r²)^2.

= [ 8r - 2r^3 + 2r^3 ] / (4−r²)^2.

The -2r^3 and +2r^3 cancel, leaving 8r / (4−r²)^2.

So yes, previous calculation was correct.

So Δλ = (1/r) * 8r/(4−r²)^2 = 8/(4−r²)^2.

Thus, K = -e^{-2λ} * Δλ = - [ (4−r²)/32 ] * [8/(4−r²)^2 ].

Which simplifies to:

= - [8 (4−r²) ) ] / [32 (4−r²)^2 ) ]

= - [8/(32)] * [ (4−r²) ) / (4−r²)^2 ) ]

= - [1/4] * [ 1/(4−r²) ) ]

= -1/(4(4−r²)).

Hmm, that's not a constant. But a pseudosphere should have constant negative curvature. So perhaps this metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the radius in this metric is different.

Wait, the radius of curvature in hyperbolic geometry is related to the curvature as r = 1/|k|, where k is the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, in our calculation, the curvature K is not constant but varies as -1/(4(4−r²)). So this can’t be a surface of constant curvature. So the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. Therefore, perhaps this question is tricky, and the answer is D) +infty because the area is infinite.

But the question specifically says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'—so perhaps I'm getting confused between different models.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric isn't 2-dimensional but embedded in 3D, but the question considers it as a 2D surface. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric of a pseudosphere.

Wait, the metric of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) in 3D can be written in terms of a parameterization, but perhaps in this case, the given metric is conformally flat and represents a space of constant curvature.

Wait, if the given metric is ds²= (32/(4−x²−y²)) (dx²+dy²), and I compute the Gaussian curvature and find it's not constant, then perhaps it's not a pseudosphere. So the area would be infinite, as the integral diverges, which would mean option D is correct.

So putting it all together, the area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, where the conformal factor is \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the coordinates is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain positive to avoid singularities.

### Step 1: Area Element
The area element \( dA \) in a 2D metric is related to the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

In polar coordinates (\( r, \theta \)), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Total Area
The total area is obtained by integrating \( dA \) over the entire domain:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \). The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) approaches \( +\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

### Step 3: Interpretation
The given metric does not represent a pseudosphere of finite area. Instead, the area diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \), where the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) approaches zero. This suggests that the metric describes an infinite-area surface, consistent with a hyperbolic plane rather than a compact pseudosphere.

### Conclusion
The area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite.

Answer: D
