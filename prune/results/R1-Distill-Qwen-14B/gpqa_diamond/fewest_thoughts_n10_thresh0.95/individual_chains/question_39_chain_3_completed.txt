Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm, wave functions... I remember they have to satisfy certain conditions like normalization.

Alright, the setup: there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that behaves the same way. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and each particle can only be found between x=1 and x=3 when measured.

Wait, the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. Oh right, the wave function in quantum mechanics is usually complex. But for normalization, I think I only need to consider the modulus squared of the wave function.

So the first thing that comes to mind is that the wave function must be normalized. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Wait, but the given wave function isn't zero outside 1-3. Hmm, maybe the wave function as given is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the region where the wave function is non-zero is from x=1 to x=3, so our integration limits will be from 1 to 3.

Wait, the question says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. So maybe the wave function given is the part between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So when we normalize, we integrate from 1 to 3.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. To normalize, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². The modulus squared of a complex number (a + ib) is (a² + b²). So in this case, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5i), so the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the imaginary part is 0.5 (since it's squared, the negative doesn't matter). So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can separate this into two integrals:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3.

At x=3: ln(4)
At x=1: ln(2)
So the first part becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2), because ln(4)=2ln(2), so 2ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So we can solve for a²:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is approximately 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213). Let's calculate that.

sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, B is 0.85.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Another way: So the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (0.5) / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is correct. Hmm. I think that's right.

So the answer should be option B, 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 \left| \psi(x) \right|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
\left| \psi(x) \right|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
