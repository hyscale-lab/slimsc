Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting compound probably has a ketone group.

Looking at the IR data first. The peaks given are in the ranges: 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretch or maybe an alkene. But wait, 3400 is more likely O-H. Also, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which suggests an acidic proton. But wait, in a ketone, that might not make sense. Oh, wait, maybe that's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but the peak is broad. Maybe it's an -OH group, but that usually shows up around 1-5 ppm unless it's something like a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. That makes sense. So the IR at 1720 could be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid, but wait, I thought the IR data included a 1720 which is more like a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the peaks. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 (broad), and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So the IR here has 3400–2500, which could include an O-H stretch. The 1720 would then be a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, more around 1700. Oh, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the NMR again. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) fit a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, so maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an electron-withdrawing group because the protons are downfield. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, so maybe that's the -COOH proton. Wait, but in the options, some are benzoic acids. Let me check the options.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, but that would make the substituents at positions 2 and 4, which are para to each other? Wait, no, 2 and 4 are meta. Oh, wait, the structure is perhaps benzene with substituents in the para positions. Hmm, let me think.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm (d) and 7.2 ppm (d). For a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on each side would be equivalent, giving two doublet signals. The 8.0 ppm is likely the protons ortho to the substituent, which is more deshielded, so the substituent is electron-withdrawing. The 7.2 ppm is the meta protons, perhaps. Wait, no, in para substitution, the two sets of protons would be the two ortho protons and the two meta protons. Wait, actually, the substitution in para position would have each substituent opposite each other. So if there's a substituent at position 4 (para) and the acid is at position 1, maybe? Or perhaps the substituents are in positions 4 and another position.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carboxylic acid group, and the other is an alkyl group. Let me think about the NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggests two protons that are ortho to substituents, maybe. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another set. So perhaps the ring is 1,4-disubstituted. For example, if there's a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent (like an alkyl) at position 4.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts. The 8.0 ppm is higher, so those protons are more deshielded. That would happen if they're ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. So perhaps the substituent in position 4 is an electron-withdrawing group, but wait, the other substituent (like the COOH) is at position 1, which would make the protons at position 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) more deshielded. So those would be at 8.0, and the protons at position 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to the other substituent) would be at 7.2. Hmm, that makes sense.

So the aromatic ring has a COOH group and another substituent para to it. So the substituent at position 4 is something else, maybe an ethyl group or a butyl group.

Looking back at the NMR data, there's also a 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which is likely a CH group. Then 1.7 ppm (m,2H), which could be a CH2, and 1.4 ppm (d,3H) which is a CH3 attached to something. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, from an ethyl group perhaps.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's isobutyl. Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)-, connected via the CH. So the group is CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm is a triplet? No, it's a doublet. So maybe it's a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another CH. So perhaps the substituent is (CH2CH(CH3)2) or something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably a CH group adjacent to other groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group. So the substituent is isopropyl. But the triplet at 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH3, so perhaps it's an ethyl group attached to a branch.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the substituent is a butyl group attached through the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached via the second carbon? No, butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the point of attachment can be at different positions. Wait, butyl can be straight (n-butyl), iso (like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-), or sec (like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3 attached via the CH? No, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Wait, isobutyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2CH3)2CH- attached via the central carbon. So the substituent would be a tert-butyl group? No, because tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's see the NMR data:

- 0.9 ppm: t, 3H → this is a terminal methyl group, perhaps part of an ethyl group.

- 1.4 ppm: d, 3H → a methyl group attached to a CH, like a geminal group. For example, in an isopropyl group, the CH would have two CH3 groups attached. But the 1.4 is a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a CH that is split by a neighboring group. Wait, maybe it's part of a sec-butyl group. Let's see: the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think about the integration. The signals are:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → likely a CH group connected to other CH2 groups.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → maybe two CH2 groups.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a terminal CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group? No, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but that's a pentyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a butyl group. The NMR shows a CH (1H), two CH2 (2H), a CH3 (3H at 1.4 ppm as d), and a terminal CH3 (3H at 0.9 ppm, t). So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, let's break it down. The substituent could be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So that would be a isobutyl group. Let's see:

The substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but the NMR would show the -CH2- as a quartet, perhaps. Let me think.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group attached in a way that has branching. Let me think of the substituent as -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's longer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall structure. The substituent on the benzene ring is a branched alkyl group. Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH that's connected to two other groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be two CH2 groups adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

Putting this together, it could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is probably the end of an ethyl group. So the substituent has an ethyl chain. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So the substituent might be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's longer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group where the middle CH has a branching. For example, -CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a butyl group.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. If the compound has a carbonyl, that's a ketone. But the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak which suggests a carboxylic acid proton. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If it's benzoic acid, then the COOH is at position 4, and the substituent is a butyl group at position 1. Alternatively, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would fit option C.

Let me check the NMR of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The benzoic acid group would have a COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm, broad singlet.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets: for a para-substituted benzene with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. The ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (around 8.0 ppm) and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be around 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see: the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)-. No, more accurately, the substituent is attached via the second carbon of butane. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, but that would be a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit confused about the substituent structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's visualize it: the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? That would make it a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching on the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a butyl group. No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. The structure would be:

Benzene ring with a substituent at position 4 (if the COOH is at position 1) as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's isobutyl. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, I think I'm getting stuck on this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR signals. For a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, the structure would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, the substituent would be:

Benzene-C(H)(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the integrations. The substituent has:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which is a CH.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m), likely two adjacent CH2 groups.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d), which is a CH3 attached to the central CH.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t), which is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So the substituent's structure must be something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group with another CH2 attached. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. That would be an isobutyl group. Let me think about the NMR for that.

Isobutyl would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is connected as benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH(CH3)2 group would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the CH, but wait, in NMR, the isobutyl group would show as a multiplet around 1.2 ppm for the two CH3's and a quartet around 1.7 ppm for the CH2. But in
