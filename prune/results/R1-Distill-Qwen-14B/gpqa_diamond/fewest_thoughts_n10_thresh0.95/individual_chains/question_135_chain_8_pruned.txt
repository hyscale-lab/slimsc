Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics, specifically looking at the decay of a boson. Let me try to think this through step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, wait, probably it's a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be something like -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Or maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe the term is more like λ times the field X times the product of fermion fields. 

But regardless, the key part here is that the interaction is between the boson X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we need to find its possible decay channels at the lowest order.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay, the total energy in the rest frame must be sufficient to produce the decay products. So, the mass of X should be at least twice the mass of the decay products. So, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. Now, I need to think about the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses.

The known fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, neutrinos). But neutrinos are very light, so their masses are negligible, so X can't decay into them unless perhaps in some beyond the Standard Model theories, but I think for this problem, we're sticking to SM.

So let's list the approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (I'll say about 4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see what fermion pairs can be produced.

For each possible fermion pair:

1. b quark pair (b b̄): Each b is about 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 =9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV. So this decay is not allowed kinematically. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait! Is that correct? Because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, which is less, so decay into b b̄ is not possible. So any option that includes b b̄ decay would be incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b̄. Hmm, but since X can't decay into b's, that option is wrong.

Option D includes b b̄ as well. So both A and D are incorrect because they include bb̄.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about the decay into pairs of quarks, but perhaps the interaction is such that only certain quarks are involved. Looking back at the problem, the interaction term given is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, that seems a bit unclear. Maybe the term is L = -λ X ψ̄_f ψ_f (ῡ?), but perhaps the exact form is that X interacts with fermions ψ_f.

Wait, maybe the term is actually L = -λ X ψ̄_f (ῡ) ψ_f, so that's a Yukawa-type interaction. So the X field couples to a fermion-antifermion pair. So X couples to any fermion that is in the loop, or perhaps in this case, the X can decay into any fermion pair ψ and ψ̄ where the fermion's mass is less than X's mass divided by 2.

So, which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 is 3 GeV)?

Let's list each fermion's mass and see:

u: 2.2 MeV → yes
d: ~5 MeV → yes
s: ~95 MeV → yes
c: ~1.27 GeV → yes
b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 GeV. 4.5 >3 GeV, so cannot decay into b b̄.
t: way too heavy.
e: 0.5 MeV → yes
μ: ~105 MeV → yes (but wait, 105 MeV is 0.105 GeV, which is less than 3)
τ: ~1.78 GeV → yes, 1.78 <3 GeV.

Wait, but the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV. So X=6 GeV, which is more than 3.56 GeV. So decay into tau pairs is allowed.

So, possible fermions that X can decay into are: u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

So the decay modes would be X → u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, τ τ̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? The top is way too heavy. So top is out.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ̄, e+ e− → includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ̄, μ+ μ−, e+ e− → includes all except b and t. So this option includes c, which is fine because 2m_c is 2.54 GeV <6 GeV.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ τ̄, μ+ μ−, e+ e− → includes t, which is impossible, so C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ̄, μ+ μ−, e+ e− → includes b, which is impossible. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B because it includes all possible fermions with mass less than 3 GeV, except for the b and t quarks.

Wait, but wait another point: when the interaction term is given, the fermions that can be produced in the decay must be the same as those that X couples to. From the Lagrangian, we see that X couples to ψ_f, so any fermion that X can couple to would be a possible decay product. So the fermions in the Lagrangian are f, which includes which species?

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the term is -λ X ψ̄_f ψ_f, which is a Yukawa coupling. So X couples to all the fermions f present in the theory, which are the quarks and leptons.

But in the problem statement, do we have any constraints on which fermions X interacts with? The given Lagrangian is in terms of ψ_f, which suggests that X can interact with any fermion ψ_f. So in this case
