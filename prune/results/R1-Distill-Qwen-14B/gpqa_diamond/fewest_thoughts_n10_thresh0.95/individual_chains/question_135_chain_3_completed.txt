Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction. The Yukawa coupling describes the interaction between fermions and a boson, like how a Higgs boson interacts with fermions. So in this case, the boson X is interacting with fermion fields ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. Oh right, because in particle decays, the conservation of energy requires that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, but wait. The decays are happening via this interaction. So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term is there. The Lagrangian term is like X ψ ψ, which suggests that X can couple to two fermions, so the decay X → f f̄ would be possible.

So the question is about which fermion pairs are possible. Let's think about the possible fermions and their masses. The X has a mass of 6 GeV, so any pair of fermions where each has a mass less than 3 GeV (since 2m < M_X) can be produced.

Wait, but wait. Fermions come in different types. Let me list the known fermion masses approximately.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but usually negligible.

Quarks:
Light quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.25 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So the X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but since fermions come in pairs, each with mass m, the sum is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can pair up. Let's see which fermions fit.

Wait, but wait. For charged leptons:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → 2m ~1 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV → 2m ~211 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

Tau: 1.777 GeV → 2m = 3.554 GeV <6 GeV → allowed. So tau pair is allowed.

What about neutrinos? Their masses are negligible, so 2m ≈0, so they can be considered as allowed, but I don't think the problem mentions them. The options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps they're not considered here.

Now for quarks:

Light quarks (u, d, s) have masses much less than 3 GeV. u: 2.2 MeV → way under. Similarly for d and s. So their pairs are allowed. So, uū, dđ, sŝ.

Charm quark: ~1.25 GeV → 2m = 2.5 GeV <6 GeV → allowed. So c c̄ is allowed.

Bottom quark: 4.7 GeV → 2m =9.4 GeV >6 GeV → Not allowed. So b b̄ is not allowed.

Top quark: way too heavy, but X is only 6 GeV. So t t̄ is impossible.

What about other fermions? Are there any other particles that could be considered? Maybe the problem is only considering standard model fermions.

So the possible decay channels are:

Electrons: e+ e-
Muons: μ+ μ-
Taus: τ+ τ-
Charm quarks: c c̄
Light quarks: uū, dđ, sŝ

Wait, but wait. The interaction Lagrangian is Y = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the fermion field ψ_f is a Dirac spinor, so this is a Yukawa coupling. So which fermions can X interact with?

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f, because the v is probably the vacuum expectation value (like the Higgs vev), but for decay processes, the v would contribute a mass term, but the interaction for X would be proportional to X ψ ψ. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to.

But wait, the problem statement gives the interaction term, which is part of the Lagrangian. So the fermions ψ_f are the ones that X couples to. So which fermions are included in ψ_f? The question isn't specific, but in the context of the Standard Model, the X would couple to all fermions. So all fermions would be possible decay products, provided their masses are low enough.

So, back to the quark masses. For the decay X → c c̄, that's allowed because 2m_c = 2.5 GeV <6 GeV. X → b b̄ is 2m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV, so not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+e−, μ+μ−, τ+τ−, uū, dđ, sŝ, c c̄.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+τ−, e+e−
Wait, that includes b b̄ which is 9.4 GeV, so 2m=9.4>6 → impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−
That includes c, which is allowed (2*1.25=2.5<6). No b, which is correct. It also includes mu, e, tau, which are allowed.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t has way too big a mass. So t is not allowed. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, dđ, tau, mu, e. So includes b, which is impossible. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: in option B, does it include all the allowed fermions? So, the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So in the decay, X can decay into any of their pairs where 2m_f <6 GeV.

So that's e+e-, mu+mu-, tau+tau-, uū, dđ, sŝ, c c̄.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all of them except b and t.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but wait. The X is a boson with a mass of 6 GeV. Let me double-check the quark masses.

Charm: ~1.25 GeV per quark → 2.5 GeV for pair. 2.5 <6 → allowed.

Bottom: 4.7 GeV each → 9.4 GeV >6 → not allowed.

Top is 173 GeV, way too heavy.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels should include all these fermion pairs.

So in the options, which include these?

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order." So I also need to think about the phase space and whether the decay is possible via the given interaction. Since the interaction is X ψ ψ, then yes, X can decay into any of these pairs as long as 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the correct answer should include all the allowed fermion pairs except those that are too heavy.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term \( \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y) \) indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. The decays are constrained by the requirement that the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Neutrinos (\( \nu \)): Negligible mass, but not explicitly included in the options.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 190 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.5 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed due to the very high mass of the top quark. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order, excluding \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \), which are too heavy.

Answer: B
