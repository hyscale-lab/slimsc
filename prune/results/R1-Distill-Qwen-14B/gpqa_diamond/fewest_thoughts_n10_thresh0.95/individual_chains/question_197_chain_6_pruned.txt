Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, let's look at the data given. The compound X has IR and NMR spectra, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to an amine or maybe something else. Wait, wait, no. Oh right! When a nitrile reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it goes through the hydrolysis to form an amine. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, the hydrolysis of a nitrile with these reagents usually converts the nitrile into an amine. So, if compound X is a nitrile, then the product would be the corresponding amine. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe compound X is an ester, and this reaction is something else. Wait, what's the reaction of esters with red phosphorus and HI? Oh right! Esters reacting with red phosphorus and HI usually undergo a reaction called the "Wolff-Kishner" type, but wait no, that's for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile. Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: nitriles (R–C≡N) can be hydrolyzed using H2O and acid catalysts, but when using red phosphorus and HI, it's a different pathway. Oh wait! I think the reaction of a nitrile with red phosphorus and HI actually leads to the formation of an amine. Because the nitrile group (RCN) is first converted to an iminophosphorane intermediate, which then gets hydrolyzed to a primary amine. So, R–C≡N + HI + P → R–CH2–NH2?

So, if that's the case, then the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is an amine. So I need to figure out what the structure of compound X is, determine its structure based on the IR and NMR data, then see what the product would be after this reaction.

Looking at the IR data. IR: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which could indicate OH or NH stretching. But also, the presence of a peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but wait, if compound X is a nitrile, then the nitrile has a strong peak around 2200-2250 cm-1. But in the given IR data, I don't see such a peak. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check the IR data again. Oh, wait, the IR data is 3400–2500 (broad), 1720, 1610, 1450. So the 1720 could be an ester or a carbonyl group. The 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So perhaps the molecule has an aromatic ring and an ester group, or maybe a ketone group.

Wait, but if the compound is a nitrile, why isn't there a peak around 2200? Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Another possibility: what if the reaction is a hydration of a nitrile? But that typically gives an amide under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, because red phosphorus and HI, in some cases, can also lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid, but I think that usually requires more vigorous conditions, like with H2O.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. The typical reaction is RCN + HIO → RCH2NH2. So, the product is a primary amine. So, if the starting material is a nitrile, after reaction, we get an amine.

But then why isn't there a peak around 2200 in the IR? Because if compound X is a nitrile, the IR must show that. Hmm. So maybe the starting material isn't a nitrile. Let me think again. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm−1 which is likely a carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O–H stretch would be very broad around 2500–3000, which is present here. Oh, wait, the IR's 3400–2500 could include an O–H stretch. So, could compound X be a carboxylic acid? Because if that's the case, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what? I'm a bit confused here. I thought that reaction was for nitriles. Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material has both a nitrile and another functional group, but the IR isn't showing the nitrile peak. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Because the IR shows a carbonyl (1720) which is typical for esters. So, if it's an ester, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Wait, I'm not too sure about that. I think esters typically undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions, but with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the ester isn't the main functional group here.

Looking at the NMR data for more clues. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton. But in an ester, the -OCH2 would be more upfield. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the -OH is around 10-12 ppm. So that peak could be from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a -COOH group, that could fit. Also, the IR has a peak around 1720 cm-1 which would be a carbonyl, so that's consistent with a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a strong O–H stretch around 2500–3300, which is present here. So the IR and NMR suggest that compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but what else? If X is a benzoic acid derivative, for example. Let me see: the NMR has 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are likely aromatic protons, probably a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substitution, the protons are typically split into two doublets. So that fits with, say, 4-ethylbenzoic acid or something similar.

Other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me try to piece this together. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be another CH2. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group adjacent to the aromatic ring.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps more accurately, a benzene ring with a substituent that is like a propyl group with a branch. Wait, let's try to see.

Looking at the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm is likely the -COOH proton.

The aromatic signals: two doublets, each integrating for 2H, likely para-substituted. So the substituent is on the para position.

The other signals: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a methylene adjacent to a CH. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be another methylene. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH (like a -CH(CH3)- group). The 0.9 (t,3H) is a methyl at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Or more accurately, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl would have the structure CH2-CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene, and the chain is something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but the NMR doesn't show that. Alternatively, let's consider the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think of possible structures. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think: the substituent could be a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the benzene has a substituent that's a butyl group, perhaps as an ethyl group with some branching.

Wait, let's think about the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH and maybe an aromatic ring. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, let's think differently. Let's imagine the substituent is a butyl group. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Wait, but that's a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Which would make it a pentyl group, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch, such as a isobutyl group.

Wait, let me think about isobutyl. The isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent of isobutyl. Let me see if that fits the NMR.

In the case of isobutyl:

The isobutyl group has a central CH(CH2CH3) connected to a CH2 which is attached to the benzene.

So, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton that's split into a multiplet, perhaps around 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 groups would give peaks at around 1.7 and 1.4, but wait, the CH2 next to the benzene would be at lower field.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, sorry, correction: the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2-) ? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a butyl group.

Wait, let's look at the NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): likely a CH group connected to another CH and perhaps an aromatic ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a CH2CH3 group, perhaps at the end of a chain.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent of -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 4-ethyl group on the benzene. Because the NMR has two doublets for the aromatic protons, suggesting a para substitution. So, if the substituent is ethyl in the para position, then that would mean the benzene is 4-ethylbenzene. But then what about the other NMR signals?

Wait, but if the substituent is a longer chain, like a propyl group, then perhaps the substituent is a 4-propyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is likely a terminal methyl group (CH2CH2CH3). So that suggests the substituent has a chain ending with a CH2CH2CH3.

Let me think of the substituent as a pentyl group. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, considering the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making the structure something like 4-(3-methylbutyl) benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me look at the options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

What's the structure of a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon group where the branching
