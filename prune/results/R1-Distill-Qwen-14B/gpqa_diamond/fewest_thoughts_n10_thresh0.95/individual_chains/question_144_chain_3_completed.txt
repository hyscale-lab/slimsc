--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on how long they live before decaying. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? So τ is approximately ħ divided by the total decay width Γ. Oh wait, no, wait. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I need to compute τ. But wait, I have to make sure the units are correct. Let me jot down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV (but I don't think I need this for the decay width, since Γ is given as 320 MeV. Hmm, maybe E_X isn't needed here. Wait, maybe because the production energy is higher than the mass, but I'm not sure. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so the meson isn't produced at rest, but that probably doesn't affect the decay width or lifetime directly. Hmm, perhaps I can proceed without using E_X.)

Wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the mean decay distance. Mean decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ, right? So L = v * τ.

But wait, I need to find the velocity. How? Oh, since the meson is a resonance, maybe I should consider its energy and mass to find its velocity. Because when you produce a particle, its energy and momentum determine its velocity.

Wait, the production energy is E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So using energy-momentum relation. E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p is the momentum.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p. Let's plug in the numbers.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

But wait, all in units where c=1, so E in GeV, m in GeV/c². Hmm, but this might complicate unit conversions later. Maybe it's better to compute the velocity in terms of beta (β) = v/c.

Alternatively, beta is given by β = p c / E. Because E = gamma m c^2, p = gamma m v, and β = v/c. So yes, β = (p c)/(E). So from that, once I find p, I can get beta.

Wait, let's calculate p. So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Solving for pc:

pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

But since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute E^2 and (m c^2)^2.

Wait, but working in natural units (like c=1), we can just compute E^2 = (p)^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) all in GeV units.

Wait, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p^2 = 8^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV².

So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So then, beta is (p c)/(E) → but since c is 1 in these units, beta is p / E.

Wait, no. Wait, beta is (p c) / (E), but in natural units, p is in GeV/c, E in GeV. So p c would have units of GeV. So beta = (p c)/E → ( (GeV/c)* c ) / GeV → GeV / GeV → dimensionless, which is correct.

So beta = (p c) / E → but since we're in natural units (c=1), beta is p/E.

Wait, p is in GeV/c, E in GeV. So p c would be GeV. So beta = (p c) / E → (GeV) / GeV → unitless. So yeah, beta = (p c) / E. But in natural units, p is in GeV/c, so p c is GeV. So as calculated, p is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. So beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV → 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

So beta ≈ 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c.

So now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ.

We have τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is given as 320 MeV. So let me convert units.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant. In units where ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm (femtometers). Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, so we can compute τ in seconds by using τ = ħ / Γ.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units first and then convert.

Alternatively, since Γ is in GeV, and ħ in GeV s, let me think.

Wait, Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ → (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.320) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Now, the velocity v is beta c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = approx 6.106e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.106e-16 m. But looking at the options, the options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, etc.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, let me re-calculate beta.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p^2 = E^2 - m^2 → 8^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV² → p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Beta is (p c) / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV → (7.91 GeV) / 8 GeV → 0.98875, yes. So beta is correct.

Now, lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.320 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 → let me compute that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that's correct.

v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate.

2 * 2 is 4, 0.966 * 2 is approx 1.932, so 4 + 1.932 = 5.932. But more accurately:

2.056875 * 2.966 → Let's compute:

2.056875 * 3 = 6.170625 → subtract 2.056875 * 0.034 = approx 2.056875 * 0.03 is 0.0617, 0.004 is 0.0082275 → total 0.0699275. So 6.170625 - 0.0699275 ≈ 6.1007.

So 6.1007e(8-24) → 6.1007e-16 meters.

Hmm, so approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps the production energy isn't needed because the decay width is given, so maybe I should have considered the relation between the width and the lifetime directly, without considering the velocity. But no, the decay distance depends on both the lifetime and the velocity.

Wait another thought: perhaps the velocity was calculated incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using relativistic equations.

Another approach: the total energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV. Then, the total energy is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → in natural units, E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So 1/gamma² is (1/(6.6667)^2) → approx 1/44.444 → 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which matches the earlier calculation of beta. So yes, beta is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the lifetime?

Let me recompute τ.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, right?

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let's compute this more accurately.

6.582 / 0.32 = ?

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.

So yes, it's 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

v is approximately 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s → 0.98875 * 3= 2.96625 → 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by τ = 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.96625 * 2.056875e-16 m.

Wait, 2.96625 * 2.056875 → let me compute this again.

Let me compute 2.056875 * 3 = 6.170625.

But 2.96625 is 3 - 0.03375. So,

2.056875 * (3 - 0.03375) = 2.056875 *3 - 2.056875 * 0.03375.

= 6.170625 - (0.069253125) → 6.170625 - 0.069253125 ≈ 6.101371875.

So 6.10137e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is the total decay width, correct? So when calculating the mean lifetime, it's τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, sometimes there's a factor involving the natural line width. Hmm, I think the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe the production energy E is 8 GeV, but perhaps the meson isn't moving at that energy. Wait, no, production energy is the energy of the meson. So E is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mean decay length using the velocity in terms of beta c, but I think that's already done.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the speed in a different way. Let me think about using gamma.

Gamma is 6.6667, as calculated earlier.

Gamma is E / (m c²) → in natural units, yes.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So beta is sqrt(1 - (1/44.4444)) → sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the decay length. Maybe the decay length is (gamma * beta * ħ c) / (m X * width) )? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The mean decay length L is given by L = (gamma * beta * c * tau) / (something?), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the velocity in terms of c multiplied by the lifetime.

Wait, let me think about units. The lifetime is in seconds, velocity in m/s. So when I multiply them, I get meters. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the production energy isn't used because the width is already given. So perhaps the velocity calculation isn't needed because the problem doesn't require it. No, because the decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should have considered whether to use that correctly.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, which is 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV * s → but I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, let me try to compute L again.

v = 2.966e8 m/s

tau = 2.056875e-24 s

So L = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

Which is (about 6.101) * 1e-16 → 6.101e-16 m.

Hmm.

Looking at the options, A is 5.0223e-16 m, D is 4.0655e-16 m. So none match 6e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me recompute beta.

Wait, another approach: using E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666...

So gamma is 6.6667.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.444)).

1/(44.444) is 0.0225, so 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, correct.

So beta is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the momentum. Let me compute p again.

p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) → E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(64 - 1.44 ) = sqrt(62.56) → let me compute sqrt(62.56).

Well, 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2: 7.9^2=62.41, 0.01^2=0.0001, 2*7.9 *0.01=0.158. So 7.91^2=62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681. Oh wait, wait.

Wait, 7.91^2 = (7.9 + 0.01)^2 = 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681.

So p = sqrt(62.56) = approximately 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but 7.91^2 is 62.5681, which is slightly higher than 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is a bit less than 7.91.

So perhaps p is 7.908 GeV/c.

Wait, 7.908^2 = ?

7.9^2=62.41, 7.908^2 = (7.9 + 0.008)^2= 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.008 + 0.008^2.

=62.41 + (12.64 * 0.008) → 62.41 + 0.10112 + 0.000064 ≈ 62.41 + 0.10112 = 62.51112.

But 62.51112 is less than 62.56.

Wait, so perhaps I should compute sqrt(62.56) more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Let me compute x where x^2 =62.56.

We know 7.9^2=62.41. 62.56-62.41=0.15.

So let's take x=7.9 + delta.

(7.9 + delta)^2 = 62.56.

7.9^2 =62.41. 2*7.9 * delta + delta^2 =0.15.

Assume delta is small, so delta^2 negligible.

So 15.8 delta ≈0.15 → delta≈0.15/15.8≈0.00949.

So x≈7.90949.

So x^2≈ (7.90949)^2 ≈62.56.

So p≈7.9095 GeV/c.

So beta = p c / E = (7.9095 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV → 7.9095/8 ≈0.9887.

Hmm, same as before.

So perhaps the velocity is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, v is beta c → 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L= 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

I'll compute it step by step.

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.966 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.1692.

So 5.932 + 0.1692 = 6.1012.

So 6.1012e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is in MeV, so I should have converted it correctly.

Wait, Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.320 GeV. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the natural unit system differently. Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor I'm missing, like whether to use Lorentz factor gamma in the lifetime.

Wait, no, the lifetime is proper time (tau) multiplied by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime. Wait a minute! Wait, proper time is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

Oh wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the decay width is measured in the rest frame, so the mean lifetime proper time is tau = ħ / Gamma.

But the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The decay width is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. Gamma is the same in all frames. So the lifetime in the rest frame is tau = ħ / Gamma.

But when the particle is moving, the lab frame observes a longer lifetime. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle's clock is running slow. So the lifetime observed is tau_lab = tau / gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, the mean proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: tau_lab = tau * gamma. Because the particle is moving, so its clock runs slower in the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, the particle lives longer. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma. So I should multiply tau by gamma.

Wait, that changes everything. Let me recompute.

Earlier, I used tau = 2.056875e-24 s, but that's the proper time. The lab frame lifetime is gamma times that.

Gamma is 6.6667.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then, the decay distance L = v * tau_lab.

v is 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 → let's compute that.

2.966 * 1.371 ≈ 4.065.

So 4.065e(8-23) → 4.065e-15 m.

Wait, 4.065e-15 m is option B or C.

Looking back, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up gamma and 1/gamma.

The proper time tau is the time measured in the rest frame. The lab frame sees the lifetime as longer, so tau_lab = gamma * tau.

But before, I thought tau was in the lab frame, which was wrong. So the correct approach is to compute the lifetime in the lab frame as gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So yes, the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.

So that gives 4.065e-15 m, matching option B.

So the correct answer is option B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \cdot \tau \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given, and the mean lifetime in the rest frame is \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \). Since the particle is moving, the lab frame lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), such that \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relativistic relation \( \gamma = E_X / m_X \), we find:
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the proper mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width is \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The proper mean lifetime in the rest frame is:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we compute:
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab frame lifetime is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
\]
Thus:
\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23})
\]
Performing the multiplication:
\[
L \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **option B**.

Answer: B
