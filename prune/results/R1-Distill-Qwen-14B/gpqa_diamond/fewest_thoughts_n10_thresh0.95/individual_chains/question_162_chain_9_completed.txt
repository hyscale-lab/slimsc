Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's only in terms of x and y. So this is probably a 2-dimensional spacetime, or maybe a 2-manifold embedded in some higher dimension. But I'm not sure about that; maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... Oh right, in the context of hyperbolic geometry, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But in general relativity, a pseudosphere might refer to a spacelike surface with a certain geometry.

Wait, but the metric given here. Let me parse it. The coefficient is 32 divided by (4 -x² - y²). So the denominator is (4 - r²), if I think in polar coordinates where r² = x² + y². So 4 is a square, so maybe the radius is 2, because 4 is 2 squared.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Wait, but in the given metric, it's (dx² + dy²), which in polar coordinates is dr² + r² dθ². So yeah, the metric becomes [32/(4 - r²)] times that.

Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's describing some kind of surface. If I'm to find the area, I probably need to compute the area of a certain region. But wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, the radius in the metric's denominator is 4, which is 2². So 2 is the radius here.

But wait, a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space usually has a negative curvature. Let me think about what the metric represents. The general form for a 2D metric is often written as ds² = f(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), where f(r) is some function. In this case, f(r) would be sqrt(32/(4 - r²)). Hmm, but I'm not sure what that implies about the geometry.

Wait, the denominator (4 - r²) suggests that r can't be more than 2, because beyond r=2, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or spacelike. So the maximum r here is 2. So the surface is defined for r < 2. 

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, is that possible? Because at r=2, the denominator becomes zero. So perhaps the pseudosphere is at r=2, the event horizon or something. But wait, in this case, the area might be calculated as the integral over the surface.

Wait, in 2D, the area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric times dθ times dr. Wait, no, actually, the area element in 2D polar coordinates is sqrt(-det g) dθ dr, but the metric here is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, the metric is in the form ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ². So the area element would be sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. So in this case, g_{rr} is 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} is the same, 32/(4 - r²) multiplied by r²? Wait, no, looking back: the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, that's [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element in 2D would be (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ. Because for the area, we integrate sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) over the angles. Since this is 2D, it's the product of the coefficients.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt( determinant of the metric ) dθ dr. The metric in polar coordinates is:

ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ².

The determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} because it's diagonal.

So determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²) * r²]?

Wait, no, because in the metric, it's [32/(4 - r²)] multiplied by (dr² + r² dθ²). So g_{rr} is 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} is [32/(4 - r²)] * r². Because the metric component for θ is multiplied by r².

So the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So the square root of the determinant is (32 r ) / (4 - r²).

Wait, but when calculating the area element, the square root of the determinant is that, so the area element dA is (32 r ) / (4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dθ dr. So let's compute sqrt(det g): sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [ (32 r²)/(4 - r²) ] ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r ) / (4 - r²).

So the area element is (32 r) / (4 - r²) dr dθ.

Now, to find the area, we need to integrate this over the appropriate limits. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, but at r=2, (4 - r²) becomes zero. So the area element would blow up there. Hmm. So perhaps the pseudosphere is the entire surface up to r=2.

Wait, but let me think. A pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is a surface with constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is actually infinite, because as you approach the boundary at infinity, the area keeps increasing.

Wait, but in this case, our metric only goes up to r=2, right? Because beyond that, the denominator becomes negative, leading to a spacelike metric, which perhaps is not the case here. So maybe the surface is a finite area.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute the area. The area would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

So the integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Then the r integral: ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that. Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. Rearranging, -(du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr / u ] = 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ ( du / u ) = -16 ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln|u| + C.

Now, substituting back, u = 4 - r².

So the integral from 0 to 2:

At r=2, u=0; at r=0, u=4.

So the integral is [ -16 ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the definite integral is:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 [ (-∞) - ln4 ] = -16 (-∞) = +∞.

So the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, but wait, because when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the integral is -16 [ (something like -infty) - (ln4) ].

Which is -16 (-infty - ln4) → -16*(-infty) = positive infinity.

So the integral is divergent, giving an infinite area.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which in this case is defined up to r=2. So the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, so the area element becomes infinite at r=2. So integrating up to r=2 would give an infinite area.

So the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. Switching to polar coordinates \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element in polar coordinates. The area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right) \left(\frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\right) = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the region \(0 \leq r < 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

First, compute the \(\theta\)-integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the \(r\)-integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \ln|u| + C = -16 \ln(4 - r^2) + C.
\]

Now, evaluate the definite integral from \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\):

\[
\left[-16 \ln(4 - r^2)\right]_0^2 = -16 \ln(0) + 16 \ln(4).
\]

As \(r \to 2\), \(\ln(4 - r^2) \to \ln(0) = -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the given options:

- **A)** \(0\): Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B)** \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\): Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C)** \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\): Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D)** \(+\infty\): Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
