Okay, let's try to work through this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, in astronomical terms, the parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1/d (in parsecs). So distance d is 1/plx. 

But wait, the problem gives N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me rewrite that. So N is proportional to plx^(-5). Hmm. Since d = 1/plx, maybe I can express N in terms of d.

Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the number density per unit distance, maybe.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. So the number of stars per unit volume in space would depend on distance. But the question probably is about how the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance r with thickness dr varies. 

Wait, the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. So when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you see depends on how many are present at different distances. But the way the question is phrased, it says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of flux or counting stars in a certain volume. So let's imagine that the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is n. Then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be approximately n * 4πr² dr. But wait, the problem states that N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a unit area (per square degree, or something) is given by N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant.

Since plx is 1/d, this would make N ∝ d^5. But that's the number of stars per unit area as a function of distance. Wait, per unit area? Because when you observe the sky, the number you see depends on how many are in a certain volume along the line of sight. So maybe the number per unit area is N = number density × volume per unit area. So the volume per unit area at a distance r with dr is approximately (π (r+dr)^2 - π r^2) × 1/d²? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the volume per unit area (like a column density) would be 2π r dr, because for a thin shell, the surface area is 2π r dr (if considering a cylindrical volume, but I'm getting a bit confused here). 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of solid angle. The number of stars in a given solid angle depends on the volume along the line of sight. So for a thin shell at distance r, the volume element is 4π r² dr (the volume of a spherical shell). But when considering a specific region of the sky (a fixed solid angle dΩ), the number of stars in that region would be the number density n multiplied by the volume along the line of sight. So for a fixed dΩ, the volume along the line of sight from r to r+dr would be dV = r² dr dΩ. So the number of stars would be n × dV = n r² dr dΩ.

But in this problem, the number of stars in a specific region (dΩ) is given as varying with parallax. So N = number of stars in dΩ ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, but earlier I thought N ∝ d^5, since plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to r^5, assuming r is the distance. But wait, that's for the number of stars in a fixed region of the sky. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. So for each r, how many stars are there per unit volume. But the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me think about this.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But that seems odd because typically, the number density of stars in the galaxy might not increase with distance. But perhaps in this specific region, the number density depends on distance in this way. 

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = K / plx^5, where K is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. 

But the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit distance. So perhaps we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to r. So if N(r) = (some constant) × r^5, then dN/dr = 5 × r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. 

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as an option for the overall change. Wait the options are A) r^3, B)r^5, etc. Hmm. Wait the question asks how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. So for a thin shell, the number of stars would be N ∝ r^5 × (thickness dr). Or perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. If the number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume multiplied by the number density. But according to the problem, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k × (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, this is N = k × d^5. But wait, if N is the number of stars in a unit area, then perhaps the number in a shell would be N × 4π r² dr? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think differently. The number of stars per unit area observed in the sky is proportional to the number of stars lying along the line of sight. So for a given direction, the number of stars in that direction is the integral of the number density n(r') dr' from r' = 0 to r.

So if n(r) is the number density (stars per unit volume) at distance r, then the number of stars per unit area in a direction at distance r would be N(r) = ∫ n(r') dr' from 0 to r.

But the problem states that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, and at distance r, plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. Therefore, N(r) = K r^5, where K is a proportionality constant.

But since N(r) is the cumulative number (i.e., the integral) from 0 to r, N(r) = ∫ n(r') dr' = K r^5.

To find n(r'), we can take the derivative with respect to r. So dN/dr = n(r) = d(K r^5)/dr = 5 K r^4.

So the number density of stars (n) at distance r is proportional to r^4.

But the question asks how the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance r). So per unit distance, the number of stars would be n(r) * dV, but wait, the number per unit distance would be the number density multiplied by the volume per unit distance, which is 4π r² dr. Wait no, perhaps it's better to think that the number of stars in a thin shell dr at radius r is N_shell = n(r) * 4π r² dr. But from earlier, n(r) = 5 K r^4. So N_shell = (5 K r^4) * 4π r² dr = 20 π K r^6 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) in that shell is proportional to r^6.

Wait, but the question isn't about the number in a shell but the change per unit distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the problem is more straightforward. The number of stars observed (N) in a specific region is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So when r increases by a small amount dr, the change in N would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is r^4. Hmm, but wait the options are about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4, then the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that n(r) is 5 Kr^4, which is the number density. So if the number of stars in a thin shell (per unit volume) is n(r), then the number in the shell (dN) is n(r) * 4π r² dr. So dN = 5 Kr^4 * 4π r² dr = 20π K r^6 dr. So dN/dr = 20π K r^6. Which is proportional to r^6. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between different approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply about the number of stars per unit volume. Since the number per unit volume is n(r) = 5 K r^4. So the number of stars in a volume element dV (which is 4π r² dr) would be n(r) * dV = 5 K r^4 * 4 π r² dr = 20 K π r^6 dr, so dN = 20 K π r^6 dr. That's the number in a shell of radius r and thickness dr.

But the question is about how the number of stars in that region (the entire region?) changes with distance. Hmm, maybe I need to think about this differently. Let's consider that for each unit increase in distance, how does the number of stars change.

If N ∝ r^5, then the derivative dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the answer would be option C, ~ r^4.

Wait, but I thought the options were about the change per unit distance. So if the number of stars in a region (say, a unit area) is N = Kr^5, then the rate of change with r is dN/dr = 5 Kr^4. So per unit distance, the number of new stars added would be proportional to r^4. So the change in number is ~ r^4.

So the answer should be option C, ~r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), we can rewrite the relationship as \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Starting with \( N \propto r^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4.
\]

This shows that the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky increases with distance as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
