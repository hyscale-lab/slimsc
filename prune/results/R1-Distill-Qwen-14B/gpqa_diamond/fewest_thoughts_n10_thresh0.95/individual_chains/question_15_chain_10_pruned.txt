Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that might not matter much here.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit from their setup.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Also, the distance of the planet from the star probably plays a role here because a closer planet might have a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I think the probability P is roughly (R_planet / R_star) squared, but wait, no—that's the area ratio, but the actual probability is more about the alignment. Oh right, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the orbital separation. Because for a given star, if the planet is closer (smaller a), there's a higher chance the orbit will align edge-on as seen from Earth.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a) * something else. Or maybe more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit. Hmm, no, that can't be right because the orbit's area is much larger. Oh wait, no, the formula for the transit probability is the ratio (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a)^2, but that's not exact. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by some factor. Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) multiplied by the sine of the inclination, but since we're considering the probability averaged over all possible inclinations, the sine component would average out to 2/π times something. Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula I think is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but wait, that would be (R_planet / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 times some function of the orbital plane's orientation. Maybe I should look up the formula, but I can't right now, so I'll try to recall.

Alternatively, the transit probability for a planet can be approximated by the formula (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but I'm not sure. Or wait, no—since the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So it's roughly (R_star
