Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it follows Hooke's law F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, in a regular (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is when the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (sqrt(k/m)) A. Looking at the options, option C says sqrt(kA²/m), but that's the non-relativistic case. But the problem here is relativistic, so things are more complicated.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy includes the rest mass energy, so the energy of the oscillator would be E = gamma mc². But wait, the oscillator is exchanging potential and kinetic energy, but in relativity, maybe the energy expressions change.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still that because it's just Hooke's law, but the kinetic energy would be relativistic, right? So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of potential and kinetic, but wait, no— in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (classical) is (1/2)kA². But when considering relativity, the energy might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is such that the total energy is conserved, and the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. But the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, let's think about the total energy. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy when x=0. But in the relativistic case, the total energy would be higher because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv².

Wait, another approach. The energy of the oscillator at maximum displacement (x=A) is all potential energy: E = (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case, is this correct? Because the potential energy is a function of x, but in relativity, the energy also includes the rest mass energy. Hmm, but the oscillator's total energy might be the sum of rest energy and the potential energy plus kinetic.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the relativistic equation of motion. The force is F = -kx, so the equation of motion would be d²x/dt² = (-k/m) x. But in relativity, the equation might change because of the relativistic mass or other factors. Wait, but for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to the non-relativistic case, but with a different expression for velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is a combination of rest energy and the oscillation energy. So the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the non-relativistic scenario, the maximum speed is when the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max^2. So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, the equation will be different because the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, perhaps the maximum speed is less than c, so let's think about relativistic energy. The total energy E is gamma mc². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So if the oscillator has maximum speed when all its energy is kinetic, then E = (gamma) mc² = K + U, but wait, the potential energy U is ½ k A² at maximum displacement. But wait, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = E_total, which equals the potential energy at maximum amplitude. So E_total is (1/2)k A² plus the rest energy? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the total energy in the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)k A². But that doesn't sound right because in the non-relativistic case, E_total would just be (1/2)kA², but when relativistic, you have to include mc² as part of the total energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is mc², which is always present. The oscillator's potential and kinetic energies would add to that. So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude (x=A), its potential energy is (1/2)k A², and kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at that point would be mc² + (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, which would be (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy is mc² + K = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc². So at x=0, E_total = gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A². Let's solve for gamma.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me write this as:

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Square both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate this expression. Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) = a, for simplification.

Then:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

v_max²/c² = (2a +a²)/(1 +a)^2 = a (2 + a ) / (1 + a)^2.

But wait, a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is probably small if the oscillator isn't ultra-relativistic. But let's plug it back.

v_max^2/c^2 = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me factor out the denominator (2 m c²) in a:

= [ (k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2

Notice that 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = 2*(1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2)) ) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's write the numerator as:

[k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2/(2) ) ] / ( (2 m c^2)^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the entire expression:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2, where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a^2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Let me factor numerator:

2a + a² = a(2 + a).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2 = c^2 [ a (2 + a) ]/( (1+a)^2 )

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, perhaps I can expand this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express v_max in terms of the given options. Let's look at option D:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ]

Which is [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1+a)^2 = (1 + 2a + a² - 1 ) / (1 +a)^2 = (2a +a²)/(1 +a)^2.

Which is exactly the expression in v_max^2/c^2. So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2a + a²)/(1 +a)^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1 +a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (a (2 + a) )/( (1 +a)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( a (2+a) ) / (1 +a )

Hmm, but the options don't match this. Let me check the options again.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, that's the same as sqrt( [ (1 + a)^2 -1 ]/(1+a)^2 ) )

Which is sqrt( (2a + a^2)/(1 + a)^2 ) ), which is what we have. So option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 +a )

Because (1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ) = ( ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) )/(1+a)^2 )= (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2.

So the sqrt of that is sqrt(2a +a²)/(1+a) times c.

Wait, but our expression is v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1+a ), which can be written as c * sqrt( [a(2 + a)] ) / (1 + a).

Alternatively, perhaps this can be simplified further.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is written as:

sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + ... )^2 ]), which is what we have. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which is ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 ) = (1 + 2a + a^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 ) = (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2.

So the sqrt of 1 - [1/(1+a)^2 ] is sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2 ) = sqrt( a(2+a) )/(1+a).

Which is what we have for v_max/c. So option D is the correct expression.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, that denominator would be 1 - (k A^2/(2 m)), which doesn't match our a.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option C is non-relativistic, which would be correct only if the velocity is much smaller than c, but the question is relativistic, so C is not the right answer.

Option D matches what we derived. So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system relativistically. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy of the oscillator includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the oscillation energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all energy is potential energy, given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy, which in relativistic terms is \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

The total energy of the system is conserved and is the sum of the rest energy and the oscillation energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]
At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), the total energy is purely kinetic:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( E_{\text{total}} \), we have:
\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]
Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) in the denominator, which does not match the relativistic expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is not consistent with the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the non-relativistic maximum speed and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
