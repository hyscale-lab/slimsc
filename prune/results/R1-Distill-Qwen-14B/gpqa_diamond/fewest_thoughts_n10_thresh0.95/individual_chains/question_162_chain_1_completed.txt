Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's expressed in terms of dx and dy. So maybe this is a 2D space with some sort of curvature.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere can be calculated, but I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Let me recall. The metric given here seems to be in two dimensions, so maybe it's describing a hyperbolic space. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in 2D can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk has a metric (dr² + (dθ²)/(1 - r²²)) / (1 - r²)^2, where r is the radial coordinate in the disk model and the radius of the disk is related to the curvature.

Wait, but looking at the given metric: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So that's similar to (1 - (r²)/a² ), where a² is 4. So a is 2. So the metric here is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's factor out the 4 in the denominator: 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) )= 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the metric becomes 8/(1 - (r²)/(2)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), assuming r is sqrt(x² + y²). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Poincaré disk coordinates.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk metric is (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r²)^2. Comparing that to what we have, the given metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in terms of the disk, 4 - r² = 4(1 - r²/4 ), so the denominator is 4 times (1 - (r²)/4). So the entire metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²) )= (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). 

Hmm, the standard Poincaré metric has a denominator (1 - r²)^2. Wait, but this metric has a denominator (1 - r²/4). So perhaps this is a scaled version.

Wait, what's the relation between the curvature and the parameter in the metric? For the Poincaré disk, the curvature is -1/(a²), where a is the radius of the disk. Or wait, I might have it backwards. Let me think. The metric of the Poincaré disk model with curvature k is given by ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - k r²/4). No, wait, maybe it's (1 + k r²/4)^(-2) or something else.

Alternatively, I've read that the metric can be written as ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² + a²)^2, where a is a constant related to the curvature. Or wait, maybe it's another scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric represents a hyperbolic space with a certain radius. The given metric is in 2D, so it's a 2-dimensional surface.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface, like a tractricoid, which is the surface of constant negative curvature. But in terms of geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is infinite because it's a surface of infinite extent. Or is that right?

Wait, no. Wait, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Wait, no. Wait, the standard tractricoid is a finite area, right? Because it's a surface of revolution with finite extent. But maybe in this context, the metric is describing a different kind of space.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the area of a sphere in a space described by this metric. Because a pseudosphere in this context might refer to a sphere in a space with negative curvature.

Wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". So perhaps the pseudosphere is a 2-sphere in a hyperbolic space. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, a sphere of radius r would have a certain area. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the area of a sphere in a space with Gaussian curvature K is given by 4π r² (1 + K r² /3 + ... ), but wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere (which is a 2-sphere embedded in a 3-manifold) is different. But I'm not so sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric given. The metric is for a 2-dimensional space. So perhaps the pseudosphere is a 2-dimensional surface. But in that case, the area would be the area of the space described by the metric.

Wait, the metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Which can be rewritten as ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y².

So this is a 2D metric, so the line element is in terms of dr and dθ.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the denominator becomes zero. So r can't be larger than 2, because otherwise the denominator becomes negative, leading to an imaginary metric, which is not physical. So the maximum r is 2. So the domain of this metric is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, this looks like the Poincaré disk model scaled. The standard Poincaré disk has a metric where the denominator is (1 - r²)^2, but here it's (4 - r²), which is 4(1 - r²/4), so (1 - r²/a²) where a=2. So perhaps this is the Poincaré disk with a radius parameter a=2.

In hyperbolic geometry, the Gaussian curvature is given by K = -1/a². So for a=2, K = -1/4.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the pseudosphere in this metric has a certain area.

Wait, the area of a sphere in a space with curvature K is 4π r² / sqrt(|K|), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere increases exponentially with radius.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the metric more carefully.

The given metric is in 2D, so perhaps this is the metric of hyperbolic space with a certain curvature.

In 2D hyperbolic space, the area of a circle (which is a 1-sphere) with radius r is 2π r (coth r) ), but I might be mixing up things. Alternatively, the area of a circle in hyperbolic space is 2π r^2 (coth r) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, but in 3D. So perhaps the area we're looking for is the surface area of a pseudosphere, which I thought is finite. I remember that the pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite surface area, but I'm not sure of the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit more straightforward. The metric given is for a 2D hyperbolic space, and the area is being asked for some region.

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". So perhaps in this context, the pseudosphere refers to a 2-sphere in a 3D hyperbolic space. But the given metric is 2D, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the metric is describing a 2D space, so the area of the entire space is being considered. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the area is infinite because the space extends to r=2, but perhaps the area is finite in some way.

Wait, I might be getting mixed up between the different models. Let me think about the metric again.

The given metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compute the area of the entire space. The area can be found by integrating the area element over the entire space.

The area element in polar coordinates is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2 (since beyond r=2, the metric becomes imaginary) of the integral from θ=0 to θ=2π of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dθ dr.

So integrating over θ first gives 2π.

So the area is 2π * ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (32 (-1/2) du)/u = (-16) ∫ du/u = (-16) ln|u| + C.

But since the limits are from r=0 to r=2:

At r=0, u=4-0=4.

At r=2, u=4 – (2)^2 = 0.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 becomes the integral from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) (1/u) du.

Which is (-16) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

Wait, but integrating from u=4 to 0 is the same as ∫ from 0 to 4, with a negative sign. Let me see:

The integral becomes:

∫ from 4 to 0 of (-16)(1/u) du = (-16) [ (ln(0) - ln(4)) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to infinity. So the area of the entire space is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, perhaps the pseudosphere in this context refers to a region up to radius 2, which would be the entire space. So the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is "+infty", so that would be the answer.

But wait, the options include A) 0, B)4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² – y²), D)+infty.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This describes a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. To analyze the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first note that the metric is valid for \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) becomes zero at \( r = 2 \), beyond which the metric becomes singular. Thus, the domain of the metric is a disk of radius 2.

The area element in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) is derived from the metric:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area of the space, we integrate over the entire domain:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_{4}^{0}.
\]

At \( u = 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), and at \( u = 4 \), \( \ln|u| = \ln(4) \). Thus, the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the total area of the space is infinite.

Since the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) corresponds to the entire space described by the metric, its area is also infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
