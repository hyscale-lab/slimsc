Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where it's complexed with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion. Oh wait, no, wait. EDTA is usually in the form of H4Y, but when it complexes with Ca²+, it's CaY²−. So the formula is CaY²−, and the complex is 1:1.

The given K value is KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formation constant Kf is given by the equation: Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, the Kf is very large, so the complex is very stable, meaning that the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution will be very low.

Now, the problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming all the Ca is in the complex (because K is so large), I can model this using the Kf expression.

Let me write down the equation. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, in this case, the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But what about the concentrations of the free ions, Ca²+ and EDTA?

Wait, but in solution, when EDTA is in solution, it's usually as H4Y, but under the given pH, it's deprotonated to Y^4-. So assuming pH is ideal, which I think means that [EDTA] = [Y^4−], because under those conditions, the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4− form is 1. So Y^4− is the same as EDTA.

But wait, the EDTA is in solution as Y^4−, and the complex is CaY²−. So the Kf is given as 5e10, which is a huge number. So the complex is almost completely formed.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of Ca²+ would be much less because most of it is tied up in the complex.

Wait, but let's think about the stoichiometry. Each mole of CaY²− contains one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−. So if all the Ca²+ were free, but it's not because it's bound, but in reality, almost all is bound.

Wait, no. Wait, when you have the complex, you can dissociate it into Ca²+ and Y^4−. But given the Kf is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the free [Ca²+] will be very low.

So let's model this. Let me let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Then, because each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−, the concentration of Y^4− will be x as well? No, wait, because the complex is 0.02 M, and if the complex dissociates a little, the free concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− would both be x.

Wait, but wait. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, it can produce some Ca²+ and Y^4−. Let me think of the dissociation as:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

So the initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaY²−] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [Y^4−] = 0.

Then, when it dissociates by a small amount x, the concentrations become:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small),
[Ca²+] = x,
[Y^4−] = x.

So substituting into the Kf equation:

Kf = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−] 

Which gives:

5e10 = (x)(x) / 0.02

So 5e10 = x² / 0.02

Then, x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9

So x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M?

Wait, that can't be right. 3e4 M is way higher than the initial concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, I think I inverted the equation. Because Kf is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]), not the other way around. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So if Kf is 5e10, then:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2)

Because [CaY²−] is 0.02, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are both x.

So solving for x^2:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12

Then x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

Wait, about 4.47e-6 M. But looking at the options, that's not one of them. The options are A: 2e-2, B:5e-3, C:6.3e-7, D:1e-2.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kf expression. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the formation constant with the dissociation constant. Formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex. The dissociation constant Kd is the reciprocal of Kf. So in solution, Kd = 1/Kf.

Wait, but in the equation I used earlier, I used Kf as the formation constant, which is correct. So Kf = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]).

Hmm, but if I get x as 4.47e-6, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that [Ca²+] = x and [Y^4−] = x.

Wait, let me think again. The solution is 0.02 M CaY²−. So if that's all of it, the [CaY²−] is 0.02. When it dissociates, each mole produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−. So the initial assumption was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution contains only the complex, so the EDTA is provided in excess. No, the question states it's a stoichiometric solution, so the molar ratio is 1:1.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So, the initial concentration of EDTA is not just from the complex. Wait, wait, but if the solution is only the complex, then the EDTA comes entirely from the dissociation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as such: the total concentration of calcium is equal to the concentration of the complex, because each complex has one Ca²+.

Wait, but that's not correct because some of the Ca²+ is free. Let me model it correctly.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of the complex is (0.02 - x), but since Kf is so large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of Ca²+ species is the sum of free Ca²+ and the Ca in the complex. So [Ca²+]_total = [Ca²+] + [CaY²−] = x + (0.02 - x) = 0.02 M. But for the Kf equation, we're looking at the free ions.

Wait, no, the Kf is the equilibrium for the formation of the complex. So the free [Ca²+] and free [EDTA] (Y^4−) are x each, and the complex is 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so [CaY²−] is approximately 0.02.

So, putting it all together:

Kf = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

Which is:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x)

So x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-12 /1

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 4e-13?

Wait, let me do the math:

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13. Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13)=sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13)=2 * (1e-6.5).

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, since 6.5 *2=13. So sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the correct answer.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaY}^{2-}
\]

Here, \( K_f \) is defined as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the solution is stoichiometric, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that the pH is ideal, meaning all EDTA exists as \( \text{Y}^{4-} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \) ions. Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K_f \), we approximate:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the \( K_f \) expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
