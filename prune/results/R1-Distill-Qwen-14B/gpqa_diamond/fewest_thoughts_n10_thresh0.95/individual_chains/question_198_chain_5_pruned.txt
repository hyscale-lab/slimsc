Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

Wait, the blue complex is the dithiocyanato one, right? I think that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So that's the third complex, because β3 is 63. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Stability constants are for each successive addition of SCN-.

Wait, the complexes would be:
- Co^2+ (no SCN),
- Co(SCN)_1^+ (β1),
- Co(SCN)_2 (β2, so β1*β2? Or wait, no: I think each β is for the stepwise formation. So β1 is for adding the first SCN, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no. Stability constants are defined as the equilibrium constant for each step. So β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+. β2 would be for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2, and so on. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n thiocyanate ions is the product of β1 to βn.

So for the third complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0 (wait, no, wait. Let me think about the charges. Co^2+ is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n):

n=1: Co(SCN)^+ (charge +2 -1 = +1)
n=2: Co(SCN)_2 (charge 0)
n=3: Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1)
n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2- (charge -2)

So the dithiocyanato complex is the n=2 case, which is Co(SCN)_2 with no charge. Its overall stability constant would be β1 * β2.

Wait, but wait. The question says that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall K for each complex is:

K1 = β1 =9 (for n=1)
K2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360 (for n=2)
K3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 9*40*63= 22680 (for n=3)
K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880 (for n=4)

Wait, but wait, am I correct in multiplying them for each step? Because each β is the formation constant for adding one more SCN^- ion. So yes, the overall K for n=2 is K2=β1 β2. Similarly, K3=β1 β2 β3, etc.

So the problem is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution. To find that, I need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form of Co(SCN)_2.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^2-.

But wait, the problem states that the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration (1e-2 M). So maybe the solution is such that most of the SCN^- is not bound to Co, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but to find the distribution of the complexes, I can use the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

I remember that the distribution of the species can be found using the formation constants and the ratio of the ligand to metal concentration.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction (or mole fraction) of each complex. The fraction f_n for each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [M] ) / ( [L]^n K_n + [L]^{n-1} K_{n-1} + ... + [L]^0 K_0 )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the fraction for each species is:

The fraction of each species is determined by the formation constants and the concentrations.

Alternatively, the fraction of the nth complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [M][L]^n) / (sum over all species of their expressions).

Wait, perhaps the distribution can be modeled by the following.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentrations of the complexes are:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4

Since [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But that's a lot of terms. Also, the [SCN^-] given is 0.1 M, but each complex consumes SCN^- ions. But wait, the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is the initial concentration. However, when complexes form, they consume SCN^- ions. So the actual [SCN^-] in solution would decrease as complexes form. But since the solution is in equilibrium, and given that the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is higher than the [Co^2+] (1e-2 M), perhaps the change is small and we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. Alternatively, if the ligand is in excess, the approximation holds.

Wait, but the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. So perhaps we can take [SCN^-] as 0.1 M because it's in excess, and the change due to complex formation is negligible. Let me assume that.

So let's proceed under the assumption that [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

So, the concentration terms become:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 =9*40*63 x (0.1)^3= 9*40=360, *63=22680, *x*(0.001)=22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4=22680 *16 x (0.1)^4= 22680*16= 362880 x * 0.0001= 36.288 x

Wait, wait, let me compute each step:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = 9*40 x (0.1)^2 =360 * x *0.01= 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 x (0.1)^3= (9*40=360), (360*63=22680), (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68 → 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = 22680 *16 x (0.1)^4 → 22680 *16 =362880 → (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → 36.288 x.

Wait, let me double-check:

β1 β2 β3 β4 =9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

So yes, that's correct.

Now, the sum of all species is x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x.

Let me compute each term:

x is 1x.

0.9x is 0.9.

3.6x is 3.6.

22.68x is 22.68.

36.288x is 36.288.

Adding them up: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6→5.5; +22.68→28.18; +36.288→64.468.

So sum is 64.468 x.

But this sum equals c(Co) =1e-2 M (0.01 M).

So:

64.468 x =0.01 → x=0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

Wait, x is [Co^2+], the free cobalt concentration.

So now, the concentration of each species can be found.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2].

[Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 x =3.6 * 0.0001551 ≈5.5836e-5 M.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that.

x is approx 0.0001551, so 3.6 * 0.0001551 = let's compute:

0.0001551 *3.6 → 0.0001551 *3 is 0.0004653, 0.0001551 *0.6=0.00009306 → sum is 0.00055836 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00055836 M.

The total cobalt is 0.01 M, so the mole fraction (or percentage) is (0.00055836 / 0.01)*100%.

0.00055836 /0.01 =0.055836 → 5.5836%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A:42.3%, B:25.6%, C:38.1%, D:16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that [SCN^-] remains 0.1 M. Because when the complexes form, they consume SCN^- ions, so [SCN^-] would actually decrease.

Wait, but the [SCN^-] given is 0.1 M. If the solution is such that the ligand is in high concentration, like 0.1 M, and the metal is 1e-2 M, which is 100 times less, perhaps the approximation holds. Because each mole of Co can bind up to four SCN^- ions. Let's see: maximum SCN^- consumed is 4 * n, where n is the total moles of Co.

n =0.01 L * 0.01 M =0.0001 mol. So 4 *0.0001=0.0004 mol. The initial moles of SCN^- is 0.1 M *0.01 L=0.001 mol. So 0.001 -0.0004=0.0006 mol SCN^- left. So [SCN^-] would be 0.0006 /0.01 L=0.06 M. Oh, wait, that's a significant change. So my initial assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M is wrong. Because the complexes would consume a significant amount of SCN^-.

Oh, so I can't ignore the change in [SCN^-] when calculating the concentrations. That complicates things because [SCN^-] is actually a variable in the equation.

So I need to model the system without assuming [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Hmm, that's more complicated. Let me think about this.

Let me define:

Let [SCN^-] = s.

We know that the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

The sum of all SCN^- is 0.1 M minus the amount consumed by the complexes.

Wait, but each complex consumes a certain number of SCN^- ions.

So, the total SCN^- consumed is:

[CoSCN^+] *1 + [Co(SCN)_2] *2 + [Co(SCN)_3^-] *3 + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] *4.

But the total [SCN^-] = 0.1 - ( [CoSCN^+] + 2[Co(SCN)_2] +3[Co(SCN)_3^-] +4[Co(SCN)_4^2-] ) ).

But this seems complicated because all these terms are interdependent.

Alternatively, I can use the conditional formation constants approach, which accounts for the free ligand concentration. But since the ligand concentration is changing, perhaps that's not straightforward.

Wait, another approach is to let [Co^2+] = x, [SCN^-] = s.

Then, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of x and s:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x s

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x s²

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x s^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x s^4

The sum of all Co species is x + β1 x s + β1 β2 x s² + β1 β2 β3 x s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x s^4 = c = 1e-2 M.

So,

x [ 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ] = 1e-2.

And the sum of all SCN^- is:

s = 0.1 - [CoSCN^+] - 2 [Co(SCN)_2] -3 [Co(SCN)_3^-] -4 [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

Which can be written as:

s =0.1 - ( β1 x s ) - 2 (β1 β2 x s² ) -3 (β1 β2 β3 x s^3 ) -4 (β1 β2 β3 β4 x s^4 )

This looks quite involved, but perhaps we can find a way to relate x and s.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider that the sum of the Co species is 1e-2, and the sum of the SCN^- is 0.1.

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the approximation that the majority of the SCN^- is in the free form, but considering that, perhaps the first approximation is not valid here, as the previous calculation gave a percentage that's much lower than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage based on the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, despite the complexes consuming some.

Wait, but the initial approach gave a percentage of around 5.5%, which doesn't match any options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations when considering the fractions. Let me think again.

Another approach: The fraction of each species can be found using the expression:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [M][L]^n) / (sum over all m (β1...βm [M][L]^m) )

So for each n=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, okay, so the denominator is the sum from m=0 to m=4 of (β1 β2...βm) [M][L]^m.

Wait, but [M] is the concentration of free Co^2+ which is x. So the denominator is x [ 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s³ + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ] =c =1e-2.

Hmm, so I can write the fraction f_2 as:

f_2 = (β1 β2 x s²) / [x (1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ) ]

Simplify:

f_2 = (β1 β2 s^2) / denominator,

where denominator is 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s³ + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

So f_2 = (β1 β2 s² ) / denominator.

But I don't know s. So perhaps I can find s from the equation.

Wait, but I also know that the sum of all SCN^- is s = 0.1 - ( [CoSCN^+] + 2[Co(SCN)_2] + 3[Co(SCN)_3^-] +4[Co(SCN)_4^2-] )

Which can be written as:

s = 0.1 - ( β1 x s + 2 β1 β2 x s² + 3 β1 β2 β3 x s^3 +4 β1 β2 β3 β4 x s^4 )

But since x = (1e-2) / [ 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can instead use an iterative approach, making an initial approximation for s and then refining it.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to make an assumption that s is close to 0.1, compute the initial f_2, and see if that gives any of the options. If not, adjust s.

Wait, let me try that.

Assume s=0.1.

Compute denominator:

Denominator =1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4

Compute each term:

β1 s =9 *0.1=0.9

β1 β2 s²=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

β1 β2 β3 s^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4=22680*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

So denominator =1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator=64.468.

Now, f_2 = (9*40*(0.1)^2 ) / 64.468 = (3.6) /64.468 ≈0.0557 or 5.57%.

Which is about 5.57%, as I calculated earlier, but this is not one of the options. So perhaps the assumption that s=0.1 is incorrect.

Thus, I must consider that s is less than 0.1, as some SCN^- is consumed by the complexes.

Wait, but how much is consumed? Let's make an initial estimate.

Let me compute the sum of the complexes' SCN usage.

If [CoSCN^+] = β1 x s =9 x s.

[Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 x.

Wait no, because when I assumed s=0.1, [Co(SCN)_2]=3.6 x, but x= 0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551.

So [CoSCN^+] =9 *0.0001551 *0.1= 0.0001396 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]=3.6 *0.0001551=0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]=22.68 *0.0001551 ≈0.003524 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]=36.288 *0.0001551≈0.005632 M.

Now, the total SCN^- consumed is:

[CoSCN^+] *1 + [Co(SCN)_2] *2 + [Co(SCN)_3^-] *3 + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] *4.

So:

= (0.0001396)*1 + (0.00055836)*2 + (0.003524)*3 + (0.005632)*4.

Calculate each term:

0.0001396 → ~0.00014

0.00055836 *2=0.00111672 → ~0.00112

0.003524 *3=0.010572 → ~0.01057

0.005632 *4=0.022528 → ~0.02253

Sum: 0.00014 +0.00112=0.00126; +0.01057=0.01183; +0.02253=0.03436.

So total SCN consumed is ~0.03436 M. Since the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, the new [SCN^-] would be 0.1 -0.03436= 0.06564 M, approximately 0.0656 M.

So s=0.0656.

Now, I can recalculate the denominator and f_2 with s=0.0656.

Compute each term in the denominator:

1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s³ + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

β1 s=9 *0.0656≈0.5904.

β1 β2 s²=9*40 * (0.0656)^2=360 * (0.004303)=360*0.004303≈1.549.

β1 β2 β3 s^3=9*40*63 * (0.0656)^3= 22680 * (0.0656^3).

Compute 0.0656^3: 0.0656 *0.0656=0.00430336; *0.0656≈0.0002822.

So 22680 *0.0002822 ≈6.404.

β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4=22680 *16 * (0.0656)^4.

(0.0656)^4: 0.0656^2=0.004303; ^2 again: 0.00001851.

So 22680 *16=362880; *0.00001851≈6.716.

Now, sum all terms:

1 +0.5904=1.5904 +1.549=3.1394 +6.404=9.5434 +6.716=16.2594.

Denominator=16.2594.

Now, f_2= (β1 β2 s² ) / denominator = (9*40*(0.0656)^2 ) /16.2594.

Compute numerator:

9*40=360.

s²= (0.0656)^2=0.004303.

360 *0.004303≈1.549.

So f_2= 1.549 /16.2594 ≈0.09525 or 9.525%.

Hmm, still not matching any of the options. So perhaps s isn't 0.0656.

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and perhaps I'm missing a better approach here.

Another approach: The distribution of the species can be found using the formula for each fraction, considering that each species depends on the ligand concentration.

Wait, perhaps I can use the method of successive approximations.

Let me assume a value for s and compute f_2, then adjust s based on the new [SCN^-].

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the change in [SCN^-], and proceed with s=0.1. But as that gives 5.57%, which isn't among the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the calculation using s=0.1 and see if I can find any mistake.

Wait, when I assumed s=0.1, the denominator was 64.468, and f_2=3.6/64.468=0.0557, 5.57%.

But the options are all around 17% and higher, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the denominator calculation when s=0.1.

Denominator=1 + β1*s + β1 β2 s² + β1 β2 β3 s³ + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4.

Plugging in s=0.1.

Compute each term:

1. 1 → 1
2. β1*s = 9 *0.1=0.9
3. β1 β2 s²=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6 → 3.6
4. β1 β2 β3 s³=9*40*63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68 → 22.68
5. β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4=9*40*63 *16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288

So denominator: 1+0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct. So f_2 is 3.6 /64.468=5.57%.

Wait, but the options are higher, suggesting that perhaps the correct approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first few terms, ignoring higher complexes.

Wait, but the options are 16.9%, which is option D. So perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 is [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]).

But when I calculated the concentrations using s=0.1, I found [Co(SCN)_2]=3.6 x, where x= [Co^2+]=0.0001551.

So [Co(SCN)_2]=3.6 *0.0001551 =0.00055836 M.

The sum of all species is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.00055836 /0.01= ~5.5836%, which is about 5.58%. But that's not any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I calculate the fractions.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the question only considers the first three complexes, or perhaps I'm supposed to find the fraction relative to the possible complexes, not including the free Co^2+.

Wait, but the question says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." So all species, including the free Co^2+.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formation constants.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, if the β are overall stability constants, then:

β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 is K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 is K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

In that case, the concentrations would be:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Wait, but that's different from the stepwise approach. So perhaps I should have used this approach instead.

In that case, the denominator would be:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-}^4.

Factor [Co^2+] out:

[Co^2+] [ 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ] = c =1e-2.

So [Co^2+] = c / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 ), where s is [SCN^-].

Hmm, but I'm not sure if the βs are stepwise or overall. The question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, the usual definition is that β for a complex is the overall formation constant. So for Co(SCN)_n, βn is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

So in that case, the concentrations would be:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

So let me proceed with this approach.

In that case, the denominator is [Co^2+] (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 ) =c → [Co^2+] = c / (denominator).

So the [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 [Co^2+] s^2.

So, the fraction f_2 is [Co(SCN)_2] / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-} )

Substituting the expressions:

f_2 = (β2 [Co^2+] s^2 ) / ( [Co^2+ ] (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 ) )

The [Co^2+] cancels out:

f_2 = (β2 s^2 ) / (1 + β1 s + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

Now, this is a function of s = [SCN^-].

But I don't know s because the complexes consume some SCN^-.

So, perhaps s can be found from the conservation of SCN^-.

Total SCN^- in solution is:

s = initial [SCN^-] - [CoSCN^+] - 2[Co(SCN)_2] -3[Co(SCN)_3^-} -4[Co(SCN)_4^2-}.

But each [CoSCN...] is given by β terms.

Expressed in terms of s and [Co^2+]:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] s

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+] s^2

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co^2+] s^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 [Co^2+] s^4.

So,

s = 0.1 - ( β1 [Co^2+] s ) - 2 β2 [Co^2+] s^2 -3 β3 [Co^2+] s^3 -4 β4 [Co^2+] s^4.

But [Co^2+] = c / denominator = 1e-2 / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 )

So substituting [Co^2+] into the equation for s:

s = 0.1 - β1 * (1e-2 / denominator ) * s - 2 β2 * (1e-2 / denominator ) * s^2 -3 β3 * (1e-2 / denominator ) * s^3 -4 β4 * (1e-2 / denominator ) * s^4.

This is a complicated equation in s. Solving this analytically is tough, so perhaps I can make an initial approximation.

Let me assume that s is close to 0.1, which is the initial concentration.

Compute denominator with s=0.1:

denominator =1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

9*0.1=0.9

40*(0.01)=0.4

63*(0.001)=0.063

16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

So denominator =1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator=2.3646.

Now, [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈0.004225 M.

Now, compute the terms in the SCN equation:

s =0.1 - (9 *0.004225 *0.1) - 2*(40 *0.004225 *0.1^2 ) -3*(63 *0.004225 *0.1^3 ) -4*(16 *0.004225 *0.1^4 )

Compute each term:

First term: 9 *0.004225 =0.038025 → *0.1=0.0038025.

Second term:40 *0.004225=0.169 → *0.1^2=0.01 → 2*0.169*0.01=0.00338.

Third term:63 *0.004225≈0.266325 → *0.001=0.000266325 → 3 *0.000266325≈0.000798975.

Fourth term:16 *0.004225≈0.0676 → *0.0001=0.00000676 → 4*0.00000676≈0.00002704.

Now, sum all these terms:

0.0038025 +0.00338=0.0071825 +0.000798975=0.007981475 +0.00002704≈0.0080085.

So,

s =0.1 -0.0080085=0.0919915≈0.092 M.

So s is now about 0.092 M.

Compute denominator with s=0.092:

denominator =1 +9*(0.092) +40*(0.092)^2 +63*(0.092)^3 +16*(0.092)^4.

Compute each term:

9*0.092=0.828.

40*(0.092)^2=40*(0.008464)=0.33856.

63*(0.092)^3=63*(0.092*0.092=0.008464; *0.092=0.000778928 → 63 *0.000778928≈0.04913.

16*(0.092)^4=16*(0.092^2=0.008464; ^2=0.00007164 → 16 *0.00007164≈0.001146.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.828=1.828 +0.33856=2.16656 +0.04913=2.21569 +0.001146≈2.216836.

So denominator=2.216836.

[Co^2+] =0.01 /2.216836 ≈0.004512 M.

Now, compute the terms again for the new s=0.092.

Compute each term:

(9 *0.004512 *0.092): 9*0.004512≈0.040608 → 0.040608 *0.092≈0.003732.

(40 *0.004512 * (0.092)^2 ) → 40 *0.004512=0.18048 → * (0.008464)=0.001532 → 2 *0.001532=0.003064.

(63 *0.004512 * (0.092)^3 ) → 63 *0.004512≈0.284376 → * (0.000778928)=0.0002217 → 3 *0.0002217≈0.000665.

(16 *0.004512 * (0.092)^4 ) → 16 *0.004512=0.072192 → * (0.00007164)=0.000005168 → 4 *0.000005168≈0.00002067.

Sum of terms:

0.003732 +0.003064=0.006796 +0.000665=0.007461 +0.00002067≈0.0074817.

s=0.1 -0.0074817=0.0925183 ≈0.0925 M.

Now, compute denominator with s=0.0925.

denominator =1 +9*(0.0925) +40*(0.0925)^2 +63*(0.0925)^3 +16*(0.0925)^4.
