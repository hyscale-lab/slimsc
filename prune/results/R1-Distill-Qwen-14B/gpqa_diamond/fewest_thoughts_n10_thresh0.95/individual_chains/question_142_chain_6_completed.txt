Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit?

Oh right, a single qubit can be represented as a 2x2 matrix. The standard basis states |0> and |1> are the computational basis. So, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. When you compute |0><0|, that's a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is a matrix with 1 in the (2,2) position.

So, adding these two matrices, |0><0| + |1><1|, would give a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes:

ρ = (1/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

Wait, that's the same as [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how this connects. Oh, wait, I think when we talk about the representation of a qubit state in the Bloch sphere, any state can be written as (|0> + e^{iθ} (cos(φ/2)|1>)) / sqrt(2), but that's for pure states. But density matrices represent mixed states as well.

Wait, the density matrix ρ has to satisfy certain properties. For a qubit, any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with magnitude ≤1. So, let's compute that.

Given ρ as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as (I)/2, because I is the identity matrix (since |0><0| + |1><1| = I). So ρ = I/2.

So if I set ρ equal to (I + r·σ)/2, then I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r·σ

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r·σ

Which implies that r·σ is the zero matrix. But σ is the vector of Pauli matrices: σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). So the equation is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0.

The only way this holds is if each component is zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but what does that mean geometrically? Oh right, the Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the surface (with r being a unit vector), and mixed states as points inside, with r having a length less than 1. So for a completely mixed state like ρ = I/2, the Bloch vector is at the origin. So the position is (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be simplified as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \(r\) is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we find:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Subtracting \(I/2\) from both sides gives:

\[
0 = r \cdot \sigma.
\]

Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this implies that all components of \(r\) must be zero. Thus, the Bloch vector \(r\) is \((0, 0, 0)\). Geometrically, this corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents a maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the origin, corresponding to the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
