Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember Michael addition is a reaction where a nucleophile attacks a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The product is an enolate. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part involves a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products based on the reagents and starting materials given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different products for A, B, and C.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. EtOH is the solvent. So, this setup is probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a diester of malonic acid. Its structure is (CH3COO)2CH2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it should form an enolate. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of another alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Here, the other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. It's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but since it's (E), the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, the structure would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a substituent on the beta carbon. Or wait, no. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-position would be the middle carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon. So, the 3-position is the carbonyl carbon, but that doesn't make sense because substituent can't be there. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a CH2-p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 where the other substituent is a p-tolyl group on the double bond? So it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but with the E configuration. Or wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, that would be a 3-p-tolylpropenoate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. But in the E configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

So, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it would attack the beta position of this acrylate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon (the middle one of the malonate), right? So, the attack would happen at the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. The beta carbon is the one next to the carbonyl, which is the CH2 in CH2=CH-. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a good nucleophile) would attack that CH2.

Wait, but wait. The Michael addition is when the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the acrylate is the Michael acceptor. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile.

So, the attack would add the malonate's enolate to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, after attack, the acrylate's carbonyl would become an alkoxide, and then perhaps undergo some protonation or other steps.

Wait, but dimethyl malonate is a symmetric diester. When it forms an enolate, the enolate would have two negative charges? No, wait, malonate has two ester groups. When deprotonated at the alpha position, the structure becomes [CH2(COOCH3)2-] with a negative charge on the central carbon. So, when it attacks the acrylate, it would add to the beta carbon.

So, let me try to visualize. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. The enolate from malonate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part), leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's alpha carbon and the acrylate's beta carbon.

So, the product would be a tricarboxylate. Let me think about the structure. The malonate has two ester groups and a CH2 in the middle. After attack, the CH2 would be connected to the acrylate's CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me think again. The enolate is the middle carbon with negative charge. It attacks the acrylate's beta carbon (CH2), so the structure after attack would be a new carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would have three ester groups. Let me see: original malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. After attack, the malonate's CH2 would add to the acrylate's CH2, so the new structure would be (CH3COO)2CH-CH2-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Wait, maybe.

But wait, the attack would form a new bond between the enolate's alpha (central) carbon and the acrylate's beta carbon. So, the product would have the structure where the malonate's CH2 is connected to the acrylate's CH2, which is connected to the C(p-tolyl)OCH3.

Wait, maybe the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Because the malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. After adding a CH2 group from the acrylate, the structure would have three ester groups: two from the malonate and one from the acrylate. So, the molecule would be CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, perhaps the structure is more like (CH3COO)2C-CH2-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the product would be a tricarboxylate where the three ester groups are on the same carbon. Wait, no. Let me think of the mechanism. The enolate attacks the acrylate, so the malonate's alpha carbon (the one that was deprotonated) would bond to the acrylate's beta carbon. So, the structure would have the malonate's two ester groups, then a single bond to the acrylate's beta carbon. So, the product would be (malonate's R groups) connected to the new CH2 group which is connected to the acrylate's group.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate and the acrylate. So, the product would have three ester groups: two from the malonate and one from the acrylate. So, the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
C-OCH3
   |
C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me see. The propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three ester groups on carbons 1, 1, and 3. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's more like:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3
   |
O-C-OCH3

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule with three ester groups, with the p-tolyl group attached.

Looking at the options, for part A, option A and B have A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Option C and D have 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. Wait, the numbering might be important.

If the product is a tricarboxylate where the p-tolyl is on the middle carbon, then the structure would have the substituent on carbon 2. So, the correct IUPAC name would be 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

So, parts A of the options A and B have that. So, I'll tentatively think that part A's product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Moving to part B: The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+ as the conditions. Wait, but wait, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2C≡N? No, wait but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCN with a double bond. No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile would have the structure CH2=CH-C≡N. Wait, no. Wait, butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN? No, that would be but-1-enenitrile. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN. Wait, but that's but-1-enenitrile. Hmm.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, it's CH2-CH2-CN. No, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: butenitrile is a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group
