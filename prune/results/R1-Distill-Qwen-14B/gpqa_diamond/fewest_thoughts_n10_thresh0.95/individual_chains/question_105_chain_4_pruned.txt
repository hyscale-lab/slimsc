Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. Because the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the spots will come into and go out of view from our perspective, causing brightness variations—like a light curve.

Wait, the question is about how this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So, if instead of spots, there was a planet transiting in front of the star, what would be the planet's radius relative to the star to produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm, okay, so when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, the star's spots are causing a similar effect, but it's a bit different because the spots are dark. Let me think about how.

The star's brightness without spots is given by its total luminosity, which depends on its radius and temperature. Since the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4, with σ being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when the spots are present, part of the star's surface is darker, so the observed flux changes as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has a filling factor of 20% in one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. But I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me make sure I understand the setup correctly.

The star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, that's 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of the star's total surface area. Or wait, the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of each hemisphere, but only one hemisphere is spotty? Or the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait no, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the other hemisphere is spot-free. So the spots cover 20% of that one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) )= 0.4πR².

So the star's total surface area is 4πR², and spots cover 0.4πR². So the fraction of the surface covered is 0.4πR² /4πR² =
