Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max. And the speed of light is c.

Wait, wait. In the classical case without relativity, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator happens when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)m v_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so we can't use the classical expressions directly.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx²; I think relativistic corrections come into play.

Wait a second, maybe I should recall the relativistic harmonic oscillator model. I remember that in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't the same as in the classical case. The force is still F = -kx, but the energy expressions are modified.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this using the principles of relativity and energy conservation. At maximum displacement (x = A), the oscillator's velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. But wait, in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at rest (v=0), the energy should just be the rest mass energy, but that can't be right because the oscillator is in motion. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up concepts here.

Wait, no. The oscillator is subject to a force F = -kx. So the potential energy would be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)kx², just like classical. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because of relativity.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy.

At maximum speed, the oscillator is at x=0, so the potential energy is zero. So the total energy E is just the kinetic energy. But wait, no, when the oscillator is at maximum speed, it's at x=0, so the potential energy is zero. But wait, that's when the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But wait, that's the same as the classical case. But wait, that can't be right because in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that converts to kinetic energy at x=0.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy plus potential. Or is the potential energy part of the total energy? Hmm.

Hold on, maybe the total energy E is given by (gamma)mc², which includes both the rest mass and the kinetic energy. But the potential energy comes from the force, so when the oscillator is at position x, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the total energy E is (gamma)mc² = (1/2)kA² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no, maybe the potential energy plus the kinetic energy equals the total mechanical energy, which in the relativistic case is the same as the total energy since F = -kx is still valid. Or is that not the case? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the energy when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A) and at x=0.

At x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero (in the non-relativistic case), and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't zero if the mass is moving at high speeds. Wait, no. At x=A, if the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's momentarily at rest, so v=0. So the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, v=0, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². Because the rest mass energy is mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So E = (gamma)mc² = (1/2)kA² + (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, that can't be right because then the rest mass energy would cancel out.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the wrong approach. Let me think of the energy when the oscillator is at x=0 (maximum speed) and when it's at x=A (zero speed). At x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E at x=A is E = (1/2)kA² + mc² (rest mass energy) because the kinetic energy in relativity is gamma mc² minus mc², but if velocity is zero, gamma is 1, so KE is zero, and E= mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that can't be, because in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus mc²? That seems confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the total mechanical energy is the sum of the classical potential and the relativistic kinetic. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, and when it's at x=A, all the energy is potential plus rest mass energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA², just like in the classical case, but the distribution between kinetic and potential varies. Wait, but that can't be because in relativity, the kinetic energy depends on the velocity, which in turn depends on the energy distribution.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach: Consider the energy at maximum speed. At x=0, the velocity is maximum, so the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is equal to the kinetic energy at that point, which is (gamma -1)mc², but wait, no, the total energy is gamma mc². Because gamma mc² is the total energy, which includes rest mass.

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me try to structure this.

At x = A, the velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero (since v=0), but the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy mc². But that doesn't seem right because in the classical case, the total energy is just (1/2)kA². So perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy as well.

Wait, but that can't be, because the oscillator's rest mass is m, so its rest energy is mc². So the potential energy when x=A is (1/2)kA², and the total energy E must be greater than mc² because the oscillator has potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic, so E should equal the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc², but wait, no. The kinetic energy is (gamma mc²) - mc² = (gamma -1) mc². So E = (gamma -1) mc². But earlier, E was mc² + (1/2)kA². Therefore, (gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply (gamma -1)m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A². But that would lead to gamma m c² = (1 + (1/2)k A²/m ) mc², which would make gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But wait, that might be possible.

Wait, let me write the equation:

At x = A:
Potential energy, U = (1/2)k A²
Kinetic energy, K = 0 (since v=0)
So E = U + K = (1/2)k A² + 0 = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that's the same as the classical case. But in relativity, the total energy should be more than mc², but here it's only (1/2)k A². So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Then, at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma -1) mc².

Setting (1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but that would make:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + 2 mc².

gamma = (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) + 2.

Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I'm getting the total energy wrong.

Wait, perhaps the total energy at x = A is mc² + (1/2)k A². So E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, the oscillator's energy is all kinetic, so E = gamma mc².

So setting them equal: gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Dividing both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), right? So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let me call that term 'a' for now. So a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + a.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

We can solve for v in terms of a.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Then, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So, v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Let me compute that:

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

= c² [ a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

But since a is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), which is a small term if the amplitude isn't too large, but perhaps we can just proceed.

Wait, but we need to find v_max, so the maximum speed. So let's write v_max as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ 2a + a² ] / (1 + a)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a) )

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a way to simplify this expression.

Wait, perhaps the denominator (1 + a)^2 and the numerator 2a + a² can be expressed in terms of 1/(1 + a)^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( (a (2 + a)) / (1 + a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Let me substitute a back in terms of k, A, m, and c.

a = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Simplify numerator inside the brackets:

( k A²/(2 m c²) ) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

= [ k A²/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

The denominator of the entire fraction is (1 + a)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2

= (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

The denominators (4 m² c^4) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Earlier, I considered that at x=A, the total energy E is (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2. Then, at x=0, E = gamma mc^2. So setting them equal: gamma mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a again. So,

gamma = 1 + a.

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + a.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

= [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2a + a² - 1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2a + a^2) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is (k A^2) over 2 m c squared.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor this.

Let me see:

2a + a² = a (2 + a)

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

= c² [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed further. Let me see the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² )

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Option C: sqrt(k A² /m), which is the classical case.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Hmm, let's compute (2a + a^2)/(1 +a)^2.

Wait, let's factor the numerator and denominator.

2a + a^2 = a(a + 2).

Denominator is (a +1)^2.

Wait, perhaps we can express this as [a (a + 2)] / (a +1)^2.

Is there a way to simplify this ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps to write it as [a (a + 2)] / (a+1)^2.

But I'm not seeing a straightforward simplification.

Wait, another approach: let's compute our expression for v_max.

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 +a )

But I'm not sure how this helps. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be rewritten as:

sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a ) = sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a + 1 )

Hmm. Not seeing it yet.

Wait, going back to the expression for v_max squared:

v^2 = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ]

= c² [ a (a + 2 ) ] / (a +1)^2.

Now, perhaps I can write this as:

c² * [ a (a + 2) ] / (a +1 )^2.

But I'm not seeing an obvious way to match this to the options.

Wait, maybe I should compute each option's expression and see if any match.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))² )

Let me compute 1 + [1/(1 - a')²], where a' = (k A²)/(2m). But in our case, a is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so a' = (k A²)/(2m) = a c².

So, in option A, 1 + 1/(1 - a')².

But our expression is (2a + a²)/(1 +a)^2.

Hmm, not matching.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - a) ), where a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, 1 + [1/(1 - a) ] = (1 - a + 1)/ (1 -a )= (2 -a)/(1 -a )

So the sqrt would be sqrt( (2 -a)/(1 -a) )

But that's not the same as our expression.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is sqrt( [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) / (1 + a)^2 )

= sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 +a )

Which matches our expression.

Wait, because earlier we had v^2 = c^2 [ (2a +a²) ]/(1 +a )^2.

So v_max^2 = c^2 * (2a + a²)/(1 +a)^2.

Which is same as [ (2a +a^2) / (1 +a )^2 ] c².

So, taking the square root, v_max = c * sqrt( (2a +a^2)/(1 +a)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a )

Which can be written as c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a )

But wait, option D's expression is D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is same as sqrt( ( (1 +a )^2 - 1 )/(1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2a +a² -1 )/(1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( (2a +a^2)/(1 +a )^2 )

Which matches our expression. So option D seems correct.

Wait, but option D is written as:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which is exactly the same as our expression.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation in the relativistic framework.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Energy at Maximum Displacement (\( x = A \)):**
   - At \( x = A \), the velocity is zero (\( v = 0 \)), so all energy is potential energy.
   - The potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \).
   - The total energy \( E \) includes the rest mass energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy:
     \[
     E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
     \]

2. **Total Energy at Maximum Speed (\( x = 0 \)):**
   - At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum (\( v = v_{\text{max}} \)), so all energy is kinetic energy.
   - The relativistic kinetic energy is \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - The total energy is also given by \( E = \gamma mc^2 \).

3. **Equating Energies:**
   - At \( x = A \), \( E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \).
   - At \( x = 0 \), \( E = \gamma mc^2 \).
   - Setting these equal:
     \[
     \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
     \]
   - Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):
     \[
     \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
     \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \):**
   - Recall \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
     \]
   - Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) for simplicity. Then:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
     \]
   - Squaring both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + a)^2.
     \]
   - Rearranging:
     \[
     1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):
     \[
     v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
     \]

5. **Matching with Options:**
   - Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
     \[
     v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
