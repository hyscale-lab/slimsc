Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I've studied a bit of relativity, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I need to find the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't use simple subtraction because of the velocity addition formula. So the relative speed is not 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because that's what you'd do normally, but relativity says otherwise.

I remember the formula for relative velocity when objects are moving at relativistic speeds. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, wait. Because u is the velocity of one object in the frame of the other. So maybe I should calculate the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me clarify.

The astronauts are moving in the same direction. So as per the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), the second astronaut (0.5c) is moving slower. So the relative speed would be the difference, but corrected with the relativistic formula.

So let's denote the first astronaut as A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c) and the second as B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c). So in the frame of A, what is B's speed?

Using the velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/c² )

Plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² )

Wait, 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7. The negative sign indicates direction—so the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7, which is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but each astronaut has their own mass and velocity. So for astronaut A, E_A = gamma_A * (2m) * c², and for B, E_B = gamma_B * (3m) c².

Wait, but wait: No, wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So their rest masses are 2m and 3m. So each contributes energy as per their own gamma.

So for A: v=0.6c, so gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

E_A = gamma_A * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For B: v=0.5c. gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * (3m) c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So that matches.

What about option D? It has E=5 mc². That's lower, probably the non-relativistic sum. Because 2m + 3m =5m, but that's just rest mass energy. So if they were at rest, it would be 5mc², but they're moving, so the energies are higher, so option D's energy is lower than the correct value. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(2m\)) and \(v_B = 0.5c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the astronaut with mass \(2m\) and \(v_A = 0.6c\):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the astronaut with mass \(3m\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
