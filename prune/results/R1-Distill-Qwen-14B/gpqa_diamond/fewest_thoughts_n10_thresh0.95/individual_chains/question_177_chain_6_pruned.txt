Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, what do I know? Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity here? Oh, right, because for stars, luminosity is related to their radius and temperature. But I'm not so sure about the mass part; maybe it's a red herring or maybe it comes into play for temperature?

The problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that's interesting. I remember something about blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength. The peak wavelength emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars emit their maximum at the same wavelength, does that mean they have the same temperature? Because if lambda is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they have the same peak emission wavelength. So that implies the same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, I remember that. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since both stars have the same temperature, the ratio of their luminosities would be the ratio of their radii squared.

But wait, let me make sure. Because I also have the radial velocities given: 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! So the star's motion towards or away from us shifts the observed wavelength. So if a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity?), the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted.

But wait, in the problem, they've determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which is the observed wavelength. So the peak emission wavelength is shifted due to their velocities. But wait, earlier I thought that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must be the same. Hmm, maybe no. Because if one is moving towards us and the other away, their actual temperatures could be different but the observed peak can be the same. Or does the Doppler shift affect the observed temperature?

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. Let's think about the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength lambda_observed is related to the emitted wavelength lambda_emitted by the formula:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But since the velocities are 700 km/s, which is way less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so v_r/c is about 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.00233, so non-relativistic. So the approximation can be made. For small v_r, the Doppler shift formula becomes approximately:

lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit * (1 + v_r/c )

But wait, direction matters. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so v_r is negative when moving towards. So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, so Star_1 isn't moving (v_r=0), Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s.

Assuming that radial velocity is positive when moving away, so Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) compared to its emitted peak.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Let me denote lambda1 and lambda2 as the observed wavelengths for Star_1 and Star_2. So lambda1 = lambda2.

But lambda1 is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, because Star_1 isn't moving. So lambda1 = lambda_emit_1.

Lambda2 is the emitted wavelength of Star_2 multiplied by (1 + v2/c ), but wait, wait. Wait, no. Because Star_2 is moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer. So lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v2/c). Or is it (1 + v_r/c ), but v_r is positive when moving away. So yes, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

But since lambda1 = lambda2, that gives lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

But lambda_emit is related to temperature via Wien's law: lambda_emit = b / T.

So for Star_1, lambda_emit_1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, lambda_emit_2 = b / T2.

So setting lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

The b's cancel out, so 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + delta), where delta is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

Hmm, so 1/T1 = (1 + 0.002333)/T2

So T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ 0.997667 T2.

So T1 is about 0.997667 times T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures would be the same. Now it's clear that's not the case because of the Doppler shift. So the actual temperatures are different, but their observed peak wavelengths are the same because of their velocities.

So now, to compute their luminosities, we need to use their actual temperatures, not the observed.

So the luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (
