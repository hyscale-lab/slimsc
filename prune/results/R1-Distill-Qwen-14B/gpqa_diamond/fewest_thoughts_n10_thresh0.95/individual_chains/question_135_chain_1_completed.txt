Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian term that describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the notation. Maybe it's better to parse this more carefully.

So, the interaction term looks like it's involving the field X coupling to some fermion fields. The term is something like λ times a fermion field ψ_f, multiplied by the conjugate ψ_f-bar, then (v + X), which is a scalar. So, the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

From what I remember, for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the energy of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson. Because in decay processes, the total energy of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle. So, the rest mass energy of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair.

Wait, but for each fermion species, say quarks or leptons, I need to know their masses. Because if the fermion is too heavy, the boson can't decay into that pair. For example, if X is 6 GeV, and a fermion is 5 GeV, then 2*5 is 10, which is more than 6, so X can't decay into that pair.

But wait, wait. Are we considering the rest mass or the current masses? Because in particle physics, when we talk about decay kinematics, it's the rest mass that matters, not the current masses, because the decay can happen in the rest frame. So, the condition is that the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fermions must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So, for each possible fermion pair, I need to see if twice their mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list all the possible fermion pairs given in the options:

Option A: b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D: b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait—each pair consists of a fermion and its antiparticle, so each pair's combined mass is twice the mass of the fermion. So, for each fermion, I need to check if 2*m_fermion <= 6 GeV.

Now, what are the masses of the known fermions?

Let me list their masses:

Quark masses (current masses):

up (u): around 2-5 MeV (but in any case, much less than 1 GeV)
down (d): similar, about 3-6 MeV
strange (s): about 95-100 MeV
charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
bottom (b): about 4.5-5 GeV
top (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV.

Lepton masses:

electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV

So, the fermion pairs and their 2m_f:

u: 2*(~2 MeV) = ~4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed
d: similar to u, allowed
s: 2*100 MeV = 0.2 GeV → allowed
c: 2*1.5 = 3 GeV → 3 <=6 → allowed
b: 2*4.5=9 GeV → 9>6 → not allowed
t: way too large, 2*173=346 GeV >>6 → not allowed
tau: 2*1.777≈3.554 GeV → allowed
e: negligible, allowed
mu: 2*0.1057≈0.211 GeV → allowed

So, which fermions can be decay products of X (6 GeV)?

Let's see. For quarks:
u, d, s, c are allowed. b and t are too heavy.

For leptons:
e, mu, tau are allowed.

Wait, but wait. The top quark is way too heavy, so decay into t t-bar is not possible.

But about the bottom quark: 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9, so decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So any option that includes b b-bar would be incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar. So that's incorrect. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. No b in decay products. So B seems possible.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, the b is too heavy, so D is wrong.

Wait, but wait. What about the coupling? The problem gives the Lagrangian.

The interaction term is -λ f f-bar ψf (v + X) ψf. Wait, perhaps I need to think about which fermions are being coupled.

Wait, the term is written as -λ f f-bar ψf (v + X) ψf. Maybe I'm getting the notation wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like -λ (f ψf-bar)(X ψf) + something. Hmm, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling type term.

In any case, the Lagrangian has ψf(y) multiplied by X(y). So, the interaction is with the fermion ψf. So, the fermion in question is ψf. So, does ψf represent all possible fermions, or is it a specific one?

Wait, the problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so the term is for fermions ψf. So, the coupling is to ψf. So, the decay products must be ψf and ψf-bar.

Therefore, the fermion in the decay products depends on which ψf is present. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify ψf, so perhaps X can decay into any of the possible fermion-antifermion pairs, as long as their mass is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the question is more general. The Lagrangian has X interacting with fermions, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that is kinematically allowed.

So, considering the fermion masses, the decay products allowed are those where 2m_f <=6 GeV.

So, let's list the possible fermion pairs:

u u-bar → 2m_u ≈4 MeV → allowed
d d-bar → same as u
s s-bar → 0.2 GeV → allowed
c c-bar → 3 GeV → allowed
b b-bar → 9 GeV → not allowed
t t-bar → 346 GeV → no way
e+ e- → 1.022 MeV → allowed
mu+ mu- → 0.211 GeV → allowed
tau+ tau- → ~3.55 GeV → allowed

So, the possible decay channels are into pairs of u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

Option C includes t, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait—what about the coupling. The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f f-bar ψf (v + X) ψf. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe the term is (f ψf-bar) (X ψf), meaning that X couples to the product of f and ψf-bar. So, perhaps X can only couple to fermions of a specific type. But the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions ψf are—so perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions, meaning that X can decay into any allowed fermion pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the term in the Lagrangian is written as Ψ_f^† (y) (v + X(y)) Ψ_f(y), which would imply that X couples to the fermion field Ψ_f. So, Ψ_f could be any fermion field, perhaps.

In that case, X can decay into any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ MX=6 GeV.

So, the decay modes are into all the fermion pairs where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

So, u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau are allowed. But not b or t.

Looking back at the options, option B includes all these except for b.

So, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:

     - \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)  

2. **Decay Products**:  
   The boson \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). From the above analysis, the allowed decays are:  
   \( X \rightarrow u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).  

3. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.  
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
