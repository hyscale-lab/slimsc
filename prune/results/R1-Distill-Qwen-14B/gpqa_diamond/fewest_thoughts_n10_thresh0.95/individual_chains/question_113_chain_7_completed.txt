--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is the correct formula based on the given spectral data.

Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or something else. Alternatively, it might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl system. Or perhaps an amide or something else. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule probably has an alkene group. That's another clue.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that in mass spectrometry, the fragments can give information about the molecular formula. The m/z of 45 is significant. I'll have to think about what fragments could give that mass. For example, 45 could correspond to a fragment like (CH3)2CHO+ or another group. Wait, let me think. The molecular ion or a fragment breaks down into smaller parts. For example, if the compound has an ester group, maybe the ester would break into parts. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe losing CO2 or something.

Let me start putting this together.

The FTIR has a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That's probably an O-H group. So either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group. So if there's both O-H and C=O, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because in a carboxylic acid, there's an O-H (broad peak) and a strong C=O around 1700.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule likely has an alkene. So maybe it's a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. That would have both a double bond and a carbonyl group. So something like CH2=CHCOOH or similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have C=O as well. But then, if it's an ester, would there be an O-H? Maybe not, unless it's an ester with an alcohol as well, but that's less likely. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: Degrees of unsaturation? Let me calculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N, X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. But wait, that's not right because C6H12O2 would have: C=6, H=12, O=2. So degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So 1 degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which is a double bond. So that fits. But then, if there's a double bond and a ring, that would be two degrees. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should do each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So either a ring and a double bond, but that would be two. Wait, no—each ring or double bond is one degree. So 1 degree can be either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present. So for C6H12O2, if it's a double bond, that accounts for one degree. Then what else? Maybe an aromatic ring? But that would be three degrees (if benzene, which has three double bonds). Wait, C6H12O2—if it's benzene, that's 6 carbons, but benzene is C6H6. So the compound here is C6H12O2. So benzene would have 3 degrees (for three double bonds). Then, having a substituent, but the molecular formula doesn't add up. Let me see: C6H12O2. If the formula is an ester, like methyl benzoate, which would be C6H5COOCH3? Wait, no, that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the other options.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond (but less likely). But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So maybe a ring plus a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two degrees. So either two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, or other combinations.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of Unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring.

So looking back, the FTIR has a broad peak (O-H), a strong peak at 1700 (C=O), and another at 1650. A C=O at 1700 is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid or ester. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which fits. So the 1650 could be conjugation, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something with a double bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

So if the molecule is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's only three carbons. The molecular formula here is C6, so perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, in such a case, the carbonyl would be conjugated with the double bond, leading to a shift in the carbonyl peak. The 1700 would be for the carboxylic acid, and the 1650 might be the C=C. But wait, C=C usually has peaks around 1650 in IR, but in conjugation with a carbonyl, maybe it's in that range. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring. If there's an aromatic ring (with C=C), then the peaks around 1650 would be the ring vibrations.

But if the FTIR shows a peak at 1650, that's in the range for conjugated double bonds, perhaps in an aromatic ring or an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

The NMR has vinyl H, so the molecule has a double bond, so the degrees of unsaturation would include that.

Let me think about the molecular formulas again. Let's say the compound is a diene or has a ring and a double bond.

Wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. What could that be? Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2CHO+ (which is 45, as (CH3)2CHO is 5 carbons? Wait, no—(CH3)2CHO is (CH3)2CH-O, which is [OCH(CH3)2]+. Wait, that's 45? Let me count: O is 16, C is 12, H is 1. So (CH3)2CHO is (2*CH3) + CH2O. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment. For example, if the molecule breaks into a CH2=CHCOO- group or something. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

Suppose the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). If it's an ester, like methyl something, but let's see.

Wait, let's think of possible compounds. If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, say, something like CH2=CHCH2COOH. Wait, that would be C5H8O2, which isn't matching any of the options given. The options are all C6. So perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be an aromatic ester or acid. For example, benzoic acid derivative. If it's benzoic acid, the formula would be C7H6O2, which isn't an option here. So perhaps it's a substituted benzoic acid. But the options have C6, so maybe a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

Option C is C6H10O2. That's more unsaturated than option A (C6H12O2). So for option C, two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring. Or two double bonds.

If the molecule has a double bond (from the NMR) and a ring, that would account for two degrees, which matches option C's degrees of unsaturation.

So, for example, if it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group or a ketone. But wait, the IR has a C=O, so maybe an ester or a ketone. Wait, but earlier we thought it's a carboxylic acid, but maybe not.

Wait, the O-H could also be an alcohol. So maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could help. Let's think about possible fragments. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, possible fragment could be a (CH2)3O+ or similar, but not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Wait, maybe it's a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is acetone. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58. Hmm, but the fragment is 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CHCOO+ ion? Wait, CH2=CHCOO has a molecular weight of 72? Or maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: m/z of 45. Let's calculate possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see:

- C3H7O: 3*(12) +7*(1) +16=36+7+16=59. No, that's too big.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHO+? (CH3)2CHO is (2*3 + 3 +16)= wait, (CH3)2CHO is (2*CH3) + CH2O. Wait, no, maybe the formula is C3H6O. Let's see: 3*12 +6 +16=36+6+16=58. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: HCOOCH2CH3. Wait, that's ethyl formate. Its molecular formula is C2H4O2. Its molecular weight is 60 (12*2 +4 +16*2=24+4+32=60). But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, think about the possible loss. For example, if the molecule loses a fragment of 45, what's left?

Wait, let's say molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it breaks off a fragment of 45, then the remaining part would be C2H5O.

Wait, 45 is the mass of the fragment. So what's 45? Let's think of 45 as a possible formula. Let's see:

45 = 12a + 1b + 16c, where a, b, c are non-negative integers. So possible combinations:

- a=3, b=3, c=0 → 36+3=39 → no.
- a=2, b=3, c=1 → 24+3 +16=43 → no.
- a=3, b=1, c=1 → 36+1 +16=53 → no.
- a=2, b=7, c=1 → 24+7 +16=47 → no.
- a=1, b=15, c=1 → 12+15 +16=43 → no.

Hmm, maybe oxygen isn't part of it. 45 without oxygen: 45 = 12a +b.

So 45=12*3 + 9 → a=3, b=9. So C3H9? But H9 is a lot. Or 12*2=24; 45-24=21 → 21 H? No, that's impossible. So perhaps including one O.

Wait, maybe 45 is CH3COO- plus something else? Wait, CH3COO is 60. No, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2O fragment. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. Not 45.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion could be losing a group, say, a benzene ring (78) but that's too big. Alternatively, the molecule could be breaking into smaller parts. Let me think of possible structures.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, if it's methyl something, the ester would have O in the structure. The FTIR would show the C=O around 1700. The O-H in the FTIR could be from an alcohol group elsewhere, but no, because esters don't have O-H unless it's an alcohol. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH2(CO2H)CH2CO2H. But that would be more than six carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Then, the degrees of unsaturation are two. So maybe a ring and a double bond. Or two double bonds.

The IR shows a broad O-H, which could be an alcohol. The C=O at 1700 could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol elsewhere.

Wait, but if the O-H is from a carboxylic acid (broad), then the C=O would be around 1700. So, maybe a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

In that case, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2COOH (but that's five carbons). Or perhaps a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula C6H10O2. That would be for a six-carbon compound with two oxygen atoms, and 10 hydrogens. The degrees of unsaturation are two, which could be a ring and a double bond.

Alternatively, it's a benzene ring but that would require three degrees (for the three double bonds in benzene). So maybe not a benzene ring. Perhaps a cyclopentene ring with a substituent.

Wait, another approach: looking at the mass spec. m/z 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2O+ which would be 44 (24+16=40; no, wait: (CH2)2O is (2*(14)) +16=28+16=44. Close but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CHO+ (which is 12 +3 +12 +16 = 43). No.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2)3O+? That's 44. Still not 45.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should think about what the possible fragments are for each molecular formula.

Let's take each option and see what m/z 45 could mean.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) = 72 +12 +32=116. So the molecular ion would be at 116. But the fragment is at 45. So if the compound breaks into a 45 fragment, the other part would be 71 (116-45=71). What's 71? 71 is a known fragment for something like C4H9O. Not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 16 O=16. Total 98. So fragment at 45 would leave 53. 53 is a possible mass for something like C3H7, but not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114. So fragment at 45 would leave 69. 69 could be C4H9O? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 69 could be something else.

Option D: C6H12O. MW: 6*12=72, 12=12, 16=16. 72+12+16=100. So fragment at 45 leaves 55. 55 is the mass of C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59? Wait, 3*12=36, 7 H=7, O=16 → 36+7+16=59. No. 55? Maybe C3H5O2? 3*12=36, 5=5, 32? 36+5+32=73. Hmm, not getting it.

Wait, maybe the m/z 45 is a prominent fragment due to the cleavage of a specific bond. For example, in an ester, the cleavage could occur at the ester oxygen, leading to two fragments. If the ester is R-O-CO-R', then breaking after the O would give R-O- and CO-R'. The R-O- would have a certain mass, and the CO-R' would have another.

Alternatively, in a carboxylic acid, maybe the molecule breaks at the COOH group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which indicates a double bond. Let's imagine the structure has a conjugated diene or a double bond adjacent to another functional group. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or acid.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group, that would have a conjugated double bond.

The FTIR would show the C=O at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (maybe at 1650). The O-H would be from the acid (if R is H, it's a carboxylic acid) or from another group.

Wait, mass spec for something like CH2=CHCOOH (which is acrylic acid, formula C3H4O2). But that's only three carbons. Our options have six carbons.

So, perhaps a substituted acrylic acid or ester with a six-carbon chain.

Alternatively, think of the molecular formula C6H10O2. For example, methyl vinyl ketone? No, that's less oxygen. Or, perhaps, it's something like cyclohexene carboxylic acid, which would be C7H10O2, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the presence of an ester group. Suppose the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has the formula C4H6O2. But our options have six carbons, so perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, if it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a broad O-H peak and a C=O peak could indicate a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's less likely given the NMR.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the mass spec. For a molecule with a molecular formula of C6H10O2 (114 g/mol), a fragment at 45 suggests maybe the molecule is breaking off a group of 45. So what's 45? Let me think about possible groups.

45 could be:

- (CH3)2CHO+ → which would be (2*3) + 3 + 16 = 6+3+16=25? No, that's not right. Wait, (CH3)2CHO is (CH3)2CH-OH? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a butoxide ion or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's the tropylium ion, which is a cyclic fragment. The tropylium ion is C7H7+ and has a mass of 91. But that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller fragment. Let's think of 45 as a possible (CH2)3O+ → 3*14 +16= 46. Close, but not 45.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3COOCH2CH3 (ethyl acetate is 88, but that's the whole molecule. So no.

Wait another approach: let's think of possible functional groups.

The IR has O-H (broad) and C=O (strong). So maybe it's a beta-keto acid, which has two carbonyl groups. Wait, beta-keto acids have the structure RC(O)COOH. That would have two carbonyl peaks. One around 1700 and another around 1650 perhaps.

So for a beta-keto acid, the IR would have two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. That could explain the 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The O-H would be from the carboxylic acid group. The NMR would show vinyl Hs if there's a double bond adjacent. Wait, beta-keto acids don't have double bonds adjacent, but perhaps the molecule is a substituted beta-keto acid with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated beta-keto acid, which would have two double bonds: one conjugated with the keto group and another. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, the IR would show a C=O around 1700 and the conjugated C=C would have a peak around 1650. So that fits.

In that case, the molecular formula would be something with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. Let's say for a six-carbon compound: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Wait, that would be C6H10O2 (assuming the formula is correct). Let's count: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens (CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH has 2+2+2+2+2= 10 H? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me count:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH → each CH2 has 2 H, the double bond (CH2=CH) has 4 H (two on each CH2). Wait, no, in CH2=CH, each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH-

But wait, the formula would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH.

Wait, let's count H:

CH2=CH: 2 H on C1, 1 H on C2.

CH2CH2: Each CH2 has 2 H.

COOH has two H (the OH and the adjacent CH2).

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's try:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH → all single bonds except the double bond between C1 and C2.

The structure is:

CH2=CH–CH2–CH2–COOH.

So the formula would be C6H10O2.

So the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl Hs. In this structure, the CH2=CH group would have two sets of vinyl Hs: the H's on C1 and C2. So that's correct.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H (from the carboxylic acid), a strong C=O at 1700, and a C=C at 1650. So that fits.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at 45. If the compound is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, what fragment would give m/z=45?

Wait, the molecular formula of the fragment would be 45. Let's see, possible fragments: maybe the COOH group breaks off, but that's 44 (COOH is COOH, which is 60 g/mol as a group, but that's not right). Alternatively, if the molecule breaks between the double bond and the rest, perhaps the CH2=CH- group would have a mass of 28 (CH2=CH is 28). That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the (CH2)2COOH part. No, that would be heavier.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the (CH2)2COO- group. Let me calculate: CH2CH2COO- → C3H5O2. Mass is (3*12)+(5)+(16*2) =36 +5 +32=73. No, that's not 45.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COO- which is 59. No.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a (CH2)3O+ group. That's C3H7O+ → 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16 → total 69. No.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible fragments could be:

- CH2=CHCOO- (which is 72 g/mol, but that's more than 45).

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller part. For example, if the compound is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate?), but that's seven carbons. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentene with a carboxylic acid substituent.

Alternatively, considering the IR, perhaps the compound is a conjugated dienophile, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: The FTIR shows O-H and two carbonyl groups. If it's a beta-keto acid, then there are two carbonyl groups. So for a beta-keto acid, the structure is RC(O)COOH. So the molecular formula would have two C=O groups. Let's see, for a six-carbon beta-keto acid, it would be something like CH2CH2COCH2COOH. Wait, that's maybe five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CO2H)CH2CH2COOH. That's getting a bit complicated, but the main point is that the presence of two carbonyl groups would explain the two strong IR peaks.

But then, the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated beta-keto acid.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me go back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is key here.

Wait, 45 is the same as the molecular weight of a methyl group plus something else. Maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (CH2=C=O), which has a mass of 44. Close to 45 but not quite.

Wait, another approach: considering the possible molecular formulas.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute the molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 114.

If the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment, the remaining part would be 114-45=69. So, what's a 69 fragment?

69 could be C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59 → no). Or C4H9 (56 → but 56+13=69 → not sure).

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a different part. For example, the ester group might break off. If the compound is an ester, say, R-O-CO-R', breaking after the ester oxygen would leave R-O- and CO-R'. The R-O- could be a fragment of 45.

So R-O- would have a molecular weight of 45. Let's see: if R is C3H7, then C3H7O would have a mass of (3*12) +7 +16=36+7+16=59. Not 45.

If R is C2H5, then C2H5O would be 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. So that's exactly 45. So if the ester group is O-CO-R', and R is C2H5, then R-O- would be C2H5O, mass 45.

So in that case, the compound would be C2H5-O-CO-R', where R' is the rest of the molecule.

So the entire molecular formula would be C2H5O-CO-R' → So R' would contribute C4H5O (since the total is C6H10O2). Wait, let me compute:

Ester is R-O-CO-R'. R is C2H5O, so R' should be C4H5O. Because the entire ester would be (C2H5O) + (CO) + R' → so (C2H5O) is O(C2H5), then CO adds O and C, and R' is the rest.

Wait, perhaps the ester is methyl propionate or something. Wait, no, the ester in this case would be something like R-O-CO-R', where R is C2H5 and R' is C3H5O (since the total formula is C6H10O2). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the ester oxygen connected to a C2H5 group, which would have a mass of 45 (C2H5O).

So the ester group would be O-CO-R', and the R-O- would be C2H5-O, which is 45.

So the molecular formula would be C2H5-O-CO-R', where R' is C4H5O. But that's getting a bit unclear.

But the key point is that the presence of a 45 fragment in the mass spec suggests that the compound has a C2H5-O group, perhaps as part of an ester.

Putting it all together: The FTIR shows O-H (probably from a carboxylic acid or ester), two C=O peaks (perhaps a conjugated system), and the NMR has vinyl Hs indicating a double bond. The mass spectrum indicates a fragment of 45, which could be from a C2H5-O group, suggesting an ester.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). Because it has two degrees of unsaturation (a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds), which fits with the NMR and IR data.

Wait, earlier I thought it's a carboxylic acid. Now, considering the ester possibility with a fragment of 45, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). So that would align with the IR, NMR, and mass spec data.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The following data was obtained:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of carbonyl groups, with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly corresponding to a conjugated C=C bond or an aromatic ring.  

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of an alkene.  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a possible fragment such as C₂H₅O⁺ (e.g., from an ester group).  

### Analysis of the Options:
The molecular formulas provided are:  
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**  

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degree of unsaturation (DoU) was calculated for each formula:  
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).  

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR indicates at least one double bond, so options with fewer than two degrees of unsaturation (A and D) are less likely.  

#### Functional Groups and Spectral Data:
- The broad O-H peak in the FTIR suggests the compound is either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.  
- The strong C=O peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group, possibly conjugated with a double bond.  
- The NMR data confirms the presence of a double bond, consistent with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester.  

#### Mass Spectrometry:
The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is consistent with a C₂H₅O⁺ fragment, which aligns with the presence of an ester group.  

### Conclusion:
The most consistent formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C). This formula accounts for the observed spectral data:  
- The broad O-H and C=O peaks in the FTIR.  
- The vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR.  
- The fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrometry.  

The compound is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or carboxylic acid with two degrees of unsaturation (a double bond and a ring).
