Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, the way light behaves can change because of relativity. But wait, this is a multiple-choice question, so maybe I can think it through step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving. I'm trying to remember if the speed of light in the medium depends on the medium's motion. Normally, when light travels through a medium, its speed is c/n, right? Because in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be c/n. But if the glass is moving, how does that affect it?

Oh, right, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So we're dealing with a scenario where both the medium and the light are moving. I think this involves some relativistic addition of velocities, but wait, I'm not sure. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but wait no, that's in a vacuum. In a medium, does that still hold?

Wait, the glass is a medium with index of refraction n, so the speed of light in it is normally c/n. But when the glass is moving, perhaps we have to consider how the light's velocity transforms when the medium is moving. Or is that not how it works?

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is always c/n in the medium's rest frame. But from another frame moving relative to the medium, how does the light's velocity look? Oh, right, the velocity addition formula in special relativity comes into play here.

So the velocity of the light in the glass's rest frame is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the velocity u in the lab frame would be (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Wait, but wait a second. Because the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, right? Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab, but the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Wait, if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going towards the observer, the glass is moving towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the beam is moving at, perhaps, c/n? Or is it more complicated because the medium is moving?

Wait, but I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to approach this correctly.

In the glass's rest frame, the light has velocity u' = c/n. The glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the speed observed in the lab, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Wait, no. Because I'm not sure whether the direction is correct. The glass is moving towards the observer, so v is positive in the direction from the glass to the observer. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, so in the glass frame, the light's speed is towards the observer.

Wait, maybe I should set up the coordinate system. Let me think that in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So if the glass is moving to the right, then v is positive. The light is moving to the right as well, because it's in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In the glass's frame (S'), the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the right. To find the velocity in the lab frame (S), we apply the Lorentz velocity transformation. The formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²]

So substituting u' = c/n and v is the glass's speed, v. But wait, v is the speed of the glass in the lab frame. So let's plug in:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v (c/n) ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c)

So the denominator becomes (n c + v ) / (n c ) ?

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v c) / (n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So the denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

Wait, no. Let me compute it again.

Denominator is 1 + ( (u') v ) / c².

u' = c/n.

So (u' * v ) = (c/n) * v.

Divide by c^2: (c v)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c )

So denominator = 1 + v/(n c )

So the denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c )

Wait, no. 1 is [n c]/(n c ), so when you add v/(n c ), you get [n c + v ]/(n c ). So denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

So putting it all together:

u = [ (c/n + v ) ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c ) ]

Which is [ ( c + n v ) / n ] divided by [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v ) /n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The n in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the denominator of the second.

So it becomes [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

So [ c (c + n v ) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's c(c +n v)/(n c + v ) ?

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which is the speed of light. But wait, that can't be right because the glass is a medium, so the speed shouldn't be c unless n=1. Or wait, but if the medium is moving, maybe it does?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Because from the lab frame, is the speed of light in the glass c/n or could it be something else?

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the glass is moving. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be different because the medium is moving. Or is it not?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the glass is moving, and the light is in the glass, would its speed be c in the lab frame?

Wait, that can't be right because the light is in a medium with index of refraction n, so in the glass frame, the speed is c/n. But if the lab frame is moving relative to the glass, then the speed can't be higher than c. So maybe it's c, regardless of the medium's motion. But that doesn't make sense because when light enters a medium, it slows down.

Wait, now I'm getting really confused. I think I need to recall some principles here. In the frame of the glass, light's speed is c/n. Then, when we
