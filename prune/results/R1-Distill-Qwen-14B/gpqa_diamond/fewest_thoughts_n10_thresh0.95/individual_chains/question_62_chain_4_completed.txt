--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the question says.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Breaking it down, the main structure seems to involve cyclohexane rings. The substituents are a hydroxy methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a carbonyl group. So, I think the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl (CHO) group attached.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

I need to find the correct sequence of reactions to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's look at the options.

First, I'll think about the possible reactions that can be applied to alkyne groups. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can do some kind of alkyne modification.

Let me try to outline the steps that might be involved in forming the target molecule.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is connected to another cyclohexane that also has a formyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is more like cyclohexane with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group on the same carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon has a formyl group. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO (carbaldehyde) group on carbon 1. But wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group on carbon 1. So perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) has on carbon 1 (the same carbon as the CHO group) a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Hence, the structure is:

The cyclohexane has a CH2 group, but wait no: the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps it's:

The molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 that is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) and also has the aldehyde group. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons (position 1) has a carbonyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached.

Hmm, perhaps it's more like a cyclohexane ring with a group that is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl))CHO? No, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon also has a formyl group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the synthesis steps. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which has a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. 

So, ethynylcyclohexane: structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a directly attached C≡CH? I think it's cyclohexane with a CH2 group connected to a C≡CH. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl is directly attached: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, the IUPAC name would be 1-ethynylcyclohexane, so the triple bond is on carbon 1 of cyclohexane.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane (say, cyclohexane with a C≡CH group), how can I get to the target molecule which has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

Let me think about the possible reactions. 

Option A: The first reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That might be a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonating compounds. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps this is an alkylation step, maybe adding a methyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Maybe we can do a substitution or elimination. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol first? No, that's more for alkynes under certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can perform an alkyne alkylation. Oh wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate things. If we have ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane, perhaps NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it. So, the alkyne CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation. So that's a longer alkyne.

Wait, but then what? The next step in option A is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, which would reduce the alkyne to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So if we have CH2-C≡C-CH3, after H2 and Pd, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's butane? Or maybe it's a cyclohexane with a longer chain.

Wait, but the product after the first two steps would be a butyl group? Not sure. Then, Ba(OH)2 step. Ba(OH)2 is often used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of ethers or for epoxide openings. Or perhaps it's for epoxide formation, but I'm not certain. The third step for option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like an oxidation condition, maybe for oxidizing a diol to a carbonyl group. Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O is the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, or secondary alcohols to ketones, I think.

But let's see. If step 1 is methylating the alkyne, making it longer, then step 2 hydrogenates it, perhaps leading to a longer chain. Then Ba(OH)2 might induce elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. Then Jones oxidation could oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not sure if this is the right path.

Looking at the target molecule, it has a formyl group. So perhaps we need an oxidation step to form the aldehyde.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde. Let me think about possible reactions. Oxymercuration could add water to the triple bond, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, for alkynes, maybe partial hydrogenation.

Wait, another reaction: Ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the starting material has an alkyne. Maybe after some steps, we get a double bond, then ozonolysis.

Wait, looking at the options, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) would break the ozonide into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So perhaps the target has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe a ketone and an aldehyde. Let me think about the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction starts with the alkyne being converted into a ketone.

Wait, another strategy: to form the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group, maybe via a Grignard reagent or some kind of addition.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about each step in the options.

Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, same idea as option A but with ethyl chloride. So maybe adding an ethyl group to the alkyne. Then, Li in liquid NH3 is for Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but not sure if applicable here. Alternatively, Li in ammonia is used for deprotonation or for elimination.

Wait, but NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne and then ethylate it to make a longer chain. Then, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation again, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Same as option A. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So hydrogenation. Then O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up for ozonolysis. Then Ba(OH)2. Hmm.

Wait, let me think: the first step methylates the alkyne. The triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation. Then step 2, hydrogenation, converts the triple bond to single bonds, so we get CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that's just a four-carbon chain. So the cyclohexane would have a butyl group attached? Wait, no, the initial structure is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to single bonds: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem helpful because we don't want a longer alkane chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is at a different position.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of ethynylcyclohexane. It's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, when we deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2, we form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it, making a longer alkyne. So, the alkyne becomes -C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens, so -CH2-CH2-CH3. So the cyclohexane would now have a propyl group attached.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the propyl group is not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into an enol ether or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group. For that, maybe using a ketone synthesis from an alkyne. One common method is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone using HgSO4 and H2SO4. Oh wait, that's option A's third step: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So that's a hydration of the alkyne to a ketone.

Wait, so if we have ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone. So, the triple bond becomes a ketone group. So cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3? Or wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add an -OH to each end. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone if the triple bond is between two carbons. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) upon hydration would form cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)CH2-OH? No, wait, no, that's for alkenes. For alkynes, the hydration is different. Wait, no, the hydration of an alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (Jones' reagent) typically adds an -OH group to each end, leading to a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on substitution.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Hydration would add an -OH to each carbon of the triple bond. So, it would become CH2-C(OH)-CH2-OH? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a ketone. Wait, ethynyl group is -C≡CH. Hydration would form a ketone if the triple bond is in the middle, but in this case, it's attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Upon hydration, it would form cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3. Because the triple bond CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-C(O)-CH3. So the cyclohexane would have a ketone group. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

Wait, no, because -C≡CH becomes -C(O)-CH3 upon hydration. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3, which is 1-(propan-2-one)cyclohexane? Not sure about the nomenclature. But that gives a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Hmm, but the target molecule has a formyl group (aldehyde), so perhaps another oxidation is needed. Or maybe that's part of a longer synthesis.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then oxidizing it. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of ring-opening or substitution.

Wait, perhaps a Grignard reagent is involved. If I have a ketone, I can add a Grignard reagent to form an alcohol, which might then be oxidized.

But let's look at the options. Option D: first step is NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate the alkyne, then add a methyl group. Wait, methanol is a methylating agent? Or maybe it's for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Hmm.

Option D's steps after alkylation are Li in liquid NH3 (which is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination), then O3 and (CH3)2S (ozonolysis), then NH4OH. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up gives aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, perhaps the overall approach is to form a diene from the alkyne, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how? Oh, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene via some addition. Alternatively, perhaps after an initial alkylation and hydrogenation, a diene is formed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the target requires. It has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. So maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group is formed via some ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are to add a substituent to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it, then perform an oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a cyclohexyl group is introduced.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne to make CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that seems like a longer chain).

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols.

Wait, but after step 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond. So if the starting material is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, after alkylation and hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. But if it's a straight chain, elimination would form a double bond somewhere. Then, Jones oxidation might oxidize an alcohol, but where would that come from?

Not sure. Maybe this isn't the right path.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate alkyne to longer chain.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it's a strong base for elimination.

3. O3 / H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → work-up, perhaps forming carbonyls.

Wait, but without any diene, ozonolysis wouldn't do much. So perhaps after step 2, we have a diene.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is deprotonation and elimination to form a diene. Let's see: after alkylation of the alkyne, we have a longer chain. Then, using a strong base to eliminate and form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group, making a longer alkyne, which upon elimination forms a diene. Then ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how that would form the target molecule.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis with reductive work-up.

4. Ba(OH)2 → elimination or perhaps oxidation?

Wait, let's think. After step 1 and 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond, making a longer chain. Then ozonolysis would break any double bonds, but if the molecule is fully saturated, maybe ozonolysis isn't applicable.

Hmm, perhaps step 2 isn't saturating but something else. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the alkyne but of something else.

Alternatively, maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, a diol is formed, but I don't think so.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate alkyne, then perhaps perform some alkylation, but methanol is more of a methylating agent, but in the presence of a base, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When you have an alkyne and treat it with a base like NaNH2, you form the acetylide. Then, methanol would act as an electrophile. So perhaps the acetylide would attack the methanol, leading to an alkoxy group. So, the alkyne becomes an ether.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, methanol might be a methylating agent under those conditions. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl group from methanol, leading to a new alkyne with a methyl group attached.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the cyclohexyl group comes from a ring-opening or substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (which is option A's step 3) would add water to the triple bond, forming a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3. Then, maybe further reactions.

But the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So how do we get from a ketone to an aldehyde? That's tricky because ketones are generally resistant to oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps through a reduction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the triple bond is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized. For example, oxymercuration of the alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone through ozonolysis, but that's if it's a di-substituted alkyne. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a mono-substituted alkyne (only one R group attached). So ozonolysis would produce a carbonyl group on one end and a hydrogen on the other.

Wait, ozonolysis of a mono-substituted alkyne would produce a ketone and a carboxylic acid or aldehyde, depending on substitution. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to first form a ketone from the alkyne, then perform some kind of Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → forms acetylide, then perhaps methanol adds a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe CH2-C≡C-CH3? Not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 deprotonates the triple bond, making an acetylide. Then, methanol would provide a methyl group. So the acetylide would attack the CH3 group from methanol, making CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne is now longer.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. If I have a longer alkyne, maybe it can be deprotonated again and then undergo elimination to form a diene.

Wait, with Li in NH3, perhaps it abstracts a proton beta to the triple bond, leading to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 → CH2-C=CH2?

Wait, but CH2-C≡C-CH3 is a four-carbon group. If Li abstracts a proton from the CH2 group next to the triple bond, elimination would form a triple bond and a double bond? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, we get a diene. Then, ozonolysis (step 3) would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a weak base, perhaps for work-up.

But I'm not certain how this would form the target molecule.

Wait, another angle. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a cyclohexane ring is being added via some kind of ring-forming reaction, like a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds, forming an alcohol, which upon oxidation becomes a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard reagent adds, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the options.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option C's steps:

After alkylation and hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes a single bond. Then ozonolysis would require a double bond, so maybe step 2 isn't hydrogenating the alkyne but another position.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the molecule has a longer chain which is then hydrogenated to form a double bond. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is of a different part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each reagent's purpose.

The target molecule has a formyl group, so perhaps an oxidation step is needed. Which options include an oxidation step? Option A has H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent (Jones' reagent). Option C has O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, not necessarily oxidation. Option D has NH4OH, which is a weak base.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, which suggests that perhaps a primary alcohol has been oxidized. So maybe we need a step that oxidizes an alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. That would protonate any deprotonated groups but isn't an oxidizing agent.

Option A's step 4 is the Jones oxidation, which can oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. But in the target, we have an aldehyde, which is not a carboxylic acid. So unless the alcohol is primary but not oxidized all the way, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidative cleavage.

Wait, another possibility: using O3 (ozone) for cleavage. Ozonolysis of an alkyne (but I'm not certain about that). Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which then undergoes ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne, not a diene. So perhaps after some hydrogenation and alkylation, a diene is formed.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are to form a vicinal diol from the alkyne, then eliminate to form a diene, which ozonolysis would cleave.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then some kind of Claisen or aldol condensation occurs to form a larger ring, which is then oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to form a longer chain with a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up and oxidation to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not exactly matching this to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Let me imagine the steps in option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne, making it longer.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer alkyl chain.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, after hydrogenation, the molecule is a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't affect it. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Unless, perhaps, the hydrogenation isn't of the alkyne but of another part of the molecule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the sequence wrong. Let me think again.

Target molecule: cyclohexane with a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

So perhaps the formyl group comes from the original ethynyl group, and the cyclohexyl group comes from a substitution.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then undergoes substitution with a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so substitution would require a good leaving group. Maybe turning the alkyne into a bromoalkane.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Maybe after converting the alkyne into a ketone, a cyclohexyl Grignard reagent adds, forming a secondary alcohol, which upon oxidation forms a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a cyclohexyl group is added via some reaction.

Alternatively, think about the target's structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1 that is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and also has a formyl group.

Wait, that's not possible because a carbon can't have five bonds. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the same ring has a formyl group on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl group on the same carbon. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But that would require the carbon to have four bonds: CH(OH) and CHO, plus two cyclohexyl groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2- group, where one CH2 is attached to a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group, and the other end is a formyl group.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Option C: Steps are alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used for elimination, like in the formation of alkenes from alcohols, or for opening epoxides.

So, after step 3 in option C, which is ozonolysis, what would happen? Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the molecule after step 2 is fully hydrogenated, so no double bonds. Thus, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So option C's step 3 doesn't make sense in this context.

Option D: Steps are alkylation, Li in NH3, ozonolysis, NH4OH.

After alkylation, the alkyne becomes longer. Then, Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, forming a diene. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH would work up the ozonide.

But how does that lead to the target?

Wait, perhaps the initial alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane. Alkylation with methyl chloride via NaNH2 would make it CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, Li in NH3 would deprotonate and eliminate to form a diene. For example, CH2-C≡C-CH3 → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 via hydrogenation, but that doesn't form a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 causes a deprotonation and elimination, turning the alkyne into a diene.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a longer alkyne, which when treated with Li in liquid NH3, forms a conjugated diene via elimination.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the diene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is in a ring structure, leading to formation of a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

But this is getting too vague.

Another thought: perhaps the correct step sequence involves converting the triple bond into a ketone, then performing a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options.

Wait, reviewing the options, option D's step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for Birch reduction or for elimination.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should look for the likely correct option based on process of elimination.

The target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests an oxidation step. Looking for steps that include an oxidation reagent.

Option A includes H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones oxidation, capable of oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Option D has NH4OH, which is a weak base and not an oxidizing agent.

So, perhaps the correct option is option A or D, but D doesn't have an oxidizing step for the aldehyde.

Wait, wait. The target has an aldehyde group, which is an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the steps should include introducing a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it.

Looking back at option D: step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. If step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, it forms aldehydes or ketones. So if the ozonolysis produces an aldehyde, then step 4 (weak base) would just protonate any deprotonated groups, but not necessarily oxidize further.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to make a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave any double bonds (but if there are none, maybe to form carbonyl groups).

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should think about the correct reagents to form the target.

The target has a formyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration (using HgSO4 and H2SO4, which is option A's step 3).

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)CH3. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in option A's step 3 is used for elimination, forming a ketone or something else. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions. So, if we have a ketone adjacent to a hydroxyl group, Ba(OH)2 might eliminate to form an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but without an epoxide, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps after forming the ketone, Ba(OH)2 is used to form a Grignard-like reaction, but Ba(OH)2 is more for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to form a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, looking at option C: after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule is a single bond. Then, ozonolysis would do nothing. So perhaps that's not it.

Option D: after alkylation, Li in NH3 could form a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, NH4OH would work-up.

So, imagine the alkyne is converted into a diene via elimination, then ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. One of them could be the formyl group. The other part might form the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is part of a ring, and ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with two carbonyls.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct sequence likely involves alkylation of the alkyne, hydrogenation to form a single bond, ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then perhaps a work-up step.

Looking back, option C has alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is after ozonolysis. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is for elimination or ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide opening, but without an epoxide, I'm not sure.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. So perhaps the starting material's alkyne is used to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond, creating a ring via some cyclization.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, because after alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, the molecule could form the necessary carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could induce elimination to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, contains a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, the synthesis must involve transformations that introduce these functional groups and cyclize appropriately.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkyl chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially used for elimination or cyclization.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O (Jones oxidation)**: Oxidizes alcohols or alkenes. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group is formed. This option seems incomplete.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne to form a longer chain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the sequence does not indicate the formation of a double bond prior to this step.
4. **NH₄OH**: A weak base for work-up. This option does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne to extend the chain.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a longer alkyl chain.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive work-up can cleave double bonds or form carbonyl groups. However, after hydrogenation, the molecule is saturated, so ozonolysis would not act unless a double bond is reintroduced.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or cyclization. This option is plausible if a double bond is formed after hydrogenation, allowing ozonolysis to create carbonyl groups.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form an ether or a methylated alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive work-up can form carbonyl groups. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group is formed.
4. **NH₄OH**: A weak base for work-up. This option does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence. Alkylation and hydrogenation extend and saturate the alkyne chain. Ozonolysis with reductive work-up can then cleave the chain to form carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)₂ may facilitate cyclization or elimination to form the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. While some steps are unclear, this option aligns most closely with the transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule.
