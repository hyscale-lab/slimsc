Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its gamma factor which relates to its speed. 

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Oh right, lithium-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. But wait, no, wait. Let me think. Protons in lithium are 3, so 3 protons plus 3 neutrons would be 6 nucleons, so it's lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Wait, but each nucleon is a proton or neutron. Their masses are almost the same, so we can approximate the mass of the nucleus as A times the mass of a proton. Or maybe better to use the exact mass of lithium-6? Hmm. Wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, we often use the atomic mass instead. Because the nucleus is moving as a whole, perhaps including electrons, but wait, in this case, it's just the nucleus. So for a nucleus, the mass would be the mass of the atom minus the electrons. But wait, when dealing with heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus. So for the purpose of calculating the rest mass, I can just use the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the rest mass energy. So the rest mass of the nucleus is important for calculating the gamma factor. 

The speed given is 0.96c. To find the total energy, I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (mc²). So the formula is E = gamma * m * c².

But first, I need to find the gamma factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So with v = 0.96c, let me compute that.

Calculating v²/c²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857... Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1 divided by 0.28. Let me see, 0.28 * 3.5714 is approximately 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, more precisely, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(784e-4) = 28e-2 = 0.28. Correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

So now, the rest mass energy is m * c². But what's the mass of the nucleus here? It's lithium-6, so A=6. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and same for a neutron, approximately. So the mass of the nucleus is 6 * (mass of a proton) ≈ 6 * 938 MeV/c². Wait, but actually, for a more precise calculation, perhaps I should use the exact mass of lithium-6. Because when you have more protons, you might have a slightly different mass due to binding energy, but for simplicity, maybe we can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the mass of the proton multiplied by A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the mass defect (binding energy). But in high-energy physics, when calculating the rest mass, it's often approximated as A times the mass of a proton or neutron. So for a nucleus with A nucleons, the rest mass is roughly A * m_p c². But for more accurate calculations, I might need the exact atomic mass.

Alternatively, for a nucleus, the mass can be approximated as (A * m_u) * c², where m_u is the atomic mass unit. Or wait, the mass of a nucleon is about 1 GeV/c². Because 1 GeV is about 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is a tiny amount of mass. So 1 GeV/c² is about 1.78e-27 kg. Wait, but the actual mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV/c².

So, for the nucleus, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), each approximately 0.938 GeV/c². So the total rest mass would be approximately 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, maybe the exact mass is needed, but without knowing the exact binding energy, perhaps this is the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass number A is 6, so the rest mass is A * m_p. But wait, m_p is the proton mass. So that would be 6 * 0.938 GeV.

Wait, but wait again. The nucleus is Li-6. The actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less than 6 * m_p because of the binding energy. Let me check the precise mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have the exact value memorized, but perhaps I can recall that the mass of a single nucleon is about 938 MeV. So for Li-6, with 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But again, the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy. But I'm not sure whether that difference is significant for this problem. The problem says the precision is at 1e-4, so I think the calculation expects using the rest mass as simply A times the mass of a proton.

Wait, but wait. Maybe a better approach is to use the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0122736 u. Because I remember that the atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6.0123 u. So the mass is 6.0123 atomic mass units (u). Then, since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², because the conversion factor is 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So let's compute the rest mass energy.

So m = 6.0123 u.

E_rest = m * c² = 6.0123 u * 931.5 MeV/u = approximately 6.0123 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0123 *931.5 ≈ 11.463 MeV. So total is about 5589 +11.463 = 5600.463 MeV. That's about 5.600463 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

6.0123 * 931.5:

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.0123 *931.5 = Let's calculate 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.0023 *931.5= 2.14245.

So 9.315 +2.14245=11.45745.

So total is 5589 +11.4574
