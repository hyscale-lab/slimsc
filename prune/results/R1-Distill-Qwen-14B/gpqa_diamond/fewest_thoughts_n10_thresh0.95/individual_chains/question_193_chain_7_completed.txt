Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. They're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which an object appears to shift its position when viewed from two different points. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. But wait, this is the formula for distance based on parallax. So distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx.

So if d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. That makes sense. So parallax decreases as distance increases.

Now, the problem says the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N becomes proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, I think I need to relate this to the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe I should consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. So the volume of that shell is approximately the surface area of a sphere with radius d, multiplied by dr. The surface area is 4πd². So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area times the number density, which depends on d.

Wait, if the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, and from plx=1/d, that's N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So maybe I'm looking at the derivative of N with respect to distance.

Wait, another approach: thinking about the number of stars per unit distance. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (r) would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dr is 5d^4. But that's not an option here. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Because plx = 1/d, 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But how does the number change per unit distance? That is, for each additional distance r, how does the number of stars change?

Wait, perhaps they are asking about the number of stars in a given distance interval, like between d and d+dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to N ∝ d^5 * 4πd² dr. Wait, no, because N is already given as a function of parallax, which depends on d. So I think I might need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the number of stars in a region of the sky (so per unit area) varies as 1/plx^5. Because when you look at a region, the number of stars you see is affected by how far away they are. Parallax plx is related to distance, so the stars' distribution in space affects how many appear in a given area.

So, let's model this. Suppose the actual number density of stars in space is n, and it's a function of distance. But in this problem, I think the number of stars per unit area (per square parsec?) is what's varying as 1/plx^5. So, number per unit area (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit area you observe would depend on the volume of space up to that distance. So if the actual density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume up to distance r would be proportional to r³. But this case is different because N varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5.

Wait, if N (number per unit area) is proportional to d^5, then the total number of stars in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N * (surface area) * dr. So that's N * 4π d² dr. Since N is proportional to d^5, the total number in that shell would be proportional to d^5 * d² = d^7, multiplied by dr.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars (per unit range of distance r) changes. So per unit r, the number of stars would be proportional to d^7? But the options don't have d^7. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me rethink. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax (i.e., distance), the number of stars in that region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then it's d^5. So the number of stars in that region (say, per unit area) is proportional to d^5.

But that seems high. If you're looking at a region of the sky, the number of stars you see depends on how many are at different distances. Wait, but if the number per unit area is proportional to d^5, that implies that as you look further away, you see more stars per area, which seems counterintuitive because stars are spread out. But maybe that's what the problem states.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. That is, for each small change in distance dr, how does the number of stars in that shell (ΔN) change.

So, if for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars is N = k * d^5 * 4π d² dr. Because the surface area is 4π d², and the number per unit area is k d^5. So ΔN = 4π k d^7 dr.

So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^7. But none of the options is d^7. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the question is considering the number of stars in a region as a function of distance, and the variation is such that for each unit of distance, the number of stars increases by a certain power.

Wait another angle: the number of stars in a region (per unit area) is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d, so (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So the number of stars per unit area is proportional to d^5. So when you look further away, you see more stars per area. But that seems odd. Wait, but it's possible if the density of stars increases with distance, but the question doesn't say that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a unit volume is a function of distance, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of flux or something else.

Wait, perhaps the issue is about the number of stars in a certain depth. Let's think about the volume of a sphere of radius r. Volume is (4/3)π r³. But if the number of stars in that volume is proportional to r^5, that's different.

Wait, but the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes large, so the number of stars increases. So if you're looking at stars at a certain distance, the number per unit area is increasing with distance.

But for a given distance, the number of stars you see per unit area is N = C * (d)^5. So if you want to find how many stars are at a distance between d and d+dr, the volume is 4π d² dr. So number of stars in that volume would be N_vol = n * 4π d² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume). But in our case, the number per unit area is N = C d^5. So that would relate to the number density.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I need to relate the number of stars in a thin shell to the number per unit area.

Wait, let's think about this. The number per unit area (N) is proportional to d^5. So N = K d^5, where K is a constant. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the number per unit area multiplied by the area of the shell. The area is 4π d². So the number in the shell is N_shell = K d^5 * 4π d² dr = 4π K d^7 dr.

So the number of stars in the shell is proportional to d^7 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^7. That's a very steep increase.

But looking at the options, the highest is r^5 (option B). So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for how the number of stars varies with distance, not considering the volume. Like, maybe it's considering the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So when d increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4.

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit range of distance, r. So perhaps it's about the rate of change of the number of stars with distance, which would be dN/dr = 5 d^4.

But that would be a function of d, not a fixed power. Wait, but the options are in terms of r. So maybe the options are assuming that r is the distance, so d is r.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is simply asking for the dependence of the number of stars on distance, given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx=1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about per unit distance. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5" which is the same as N = k * (1/plx)^5 → k * d^5. So total N is proportional to d^5.

But if the number of stars increases as d^5, then for each additional distance dr, the increase in number would be the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4, so option C is r^4.

Wait, but the question isn't phrased as the number of stars per unit distance, but the change in number per unit distance. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r?" So perhaps it's asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. So if N = C d^5, then dN/dr = 5 C d^4. Therefore, the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So the number of stars increases as r^4 with distance. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me recheck. Suppose N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N ∝ d^5. So N = k d^5. The number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So the change in number of stars with distance is proportional to d^4. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Alternatively, if the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, which is proportional to r^5 * 4π r² dr. So the number per unit distance is 4π r^7 dr. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, but the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So it's possible that the number per unit volume is proportional to 1/plx^5. But I'm not sure. Another approach: if the number of stars in a given region of the sky decreases with distance because they are farther away, but according to this, it's increasing. So it's counterintuitive, but according to the problem statement, it's given.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the number of stars in a volume element varies with distance. The volume element is 4π d² dd. If the number of stars in that volume is proportional to d^5, then the number would be proportional to d^5 * d² dd = d^7 dd. So the number of stars per unit distance in that shell is d^7.

But again, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the number of stars in the region of the sky is proportional to 1/plx^5. So when parallax (plx) increases (i.e., closer stars), the number of stars increases. So for stars at a certain distance (same plx), the number in that region is higher. But when considering the number per unit distance, perhaps the approach is different.

Another angle: let's express the number of stars in terms of distance. Let me consider the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance, but without knowing anything about the actual density, it's hard to say. But the problem states the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C (1/plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, then N = C d^5.

So the number of stars in the region is proportional to d^5. So as you move further, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So the change in number per additional distance dr is the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dr = 5 C d^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~ r^4.

So the number increases with distance to the fourth power per unit distance. So the correct answer is C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as \( d^5 \) with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (\( r \)) increases as \( r^4 \). Comparing this result with the given options:

- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the rate of change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is steeper than \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range of distance as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
