Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, the question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this ρ is a density matrix, and I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as points in a 3D space with coordinates (x, y, z), I think.

I think density matrices can be represented as points on the Bloch sphere when the system is a single qubit. Oh right, for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be parametrized using the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The general form for a single qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I can compare this to the given ρ.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) multiplied by 1/2. Let me compute what that is. |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, which is a diagonal matrix with [1, 0, 0, 0], and |1⟩⟨1| is [0, 0, 0, 1]. Adding them together gives a matrix with [1, 0, 0, 1], but multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2. So ρ is diagonal with [1/2, 0, 0, 1/2].

Wait, but if I write the general form, I = [[1,0],[0,1]] in 2x2. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be x σx + y σy + z σz.

So substituting into ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, the matrix becomes:

(1/2) [ [1 + z, x - i y],
          [x + i y, 1 - z] ]

But our given ρ is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal. So the off-diagonal terms must be zero. That means the x and y components must be zero. So the Bloch vector r would have x=0, y=0. What about z?

Looking at the diagonal terms, each is (1/2)(1 + z) and (1/2)(1 - z). For the given ρ, both diagonal terms are 1/2. So:

(1 + z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + z = 1 → z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That would mean the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is the completely mixed state. Because a maximally mixed state is (I/2), which is what ρ is. 

Wait, but the options given are:

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct position is option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \([1/2, 0, 0, 1/2]\). For a single qubit, the Bloch vector representation of a density matrix is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + z & x - i y \\
x + i y & 1 - z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms must be zero, which implies \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\). The diagonal terms are both \(1/2\), which gives:

\[
\frac{1 + z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the maximally mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Comparing this to the options:

- **A)** \((1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as \(x\) and \(y\) are not zero.
- **B)** \((0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as \(z = 0\), not 1.
- **C)** \((0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as derived above.
- **D)** \((1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are not zero.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
