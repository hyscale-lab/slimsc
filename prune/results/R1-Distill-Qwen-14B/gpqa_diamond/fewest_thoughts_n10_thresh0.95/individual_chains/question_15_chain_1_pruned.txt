Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Let's see, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one because they have limited time.

So the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity method. They share the same minimum masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2 is P2, and P1 = P2/3. So Planet_1 is orbiting much faster, closer to the star probably.

Both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity affects transit probability, but here it's zero for both. So no difference there.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So M1 = 2*M2, R1 = R2.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_p / a) * (1/(something else)), but wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) where e is the orbital eccentricity. But since e is zero for both, that part is 1. So the probability depends on R_p and a.

Wait, but in this scenario, I don't have R_p (planet radius) given. The planets have the same minimum mass, but mass isn't the same as radius. Hmm, but both are Earth-like, so maybe their radii are similar. Let's assume R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So R_p is not the differentiating factor here.

The key factors for transit probability are the orbital distance and the star's size. The probability is approximately (R_p / a) * (R_* / a) × something, but wait, more accurately, the geometric probability is given by (R_p + R_*) / a, but for small planets compared to the star, it's approximated as (R_p / a) * (1 / (something else)).

Wait, let me think. I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but that's not exactly right. Wait, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but if e is zero, it's (R_p / a). But wait, no, that's not right. The actual formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a) * ( (R_p)/(R_*) ) ) or something else.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relative scale. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. The probability of a transit is roughly (R_*/a) / (something). Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, the probability is higher when the orbital distance is smaller because the planet is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_*) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R
