Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. Hmm, okay, so it's reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are numbers like 25, 29, 31, 35.

First, let's try to figure out what Substance X could be. Since X is used in organic chemistry, it's probably something like a strong base or a reagent that's commonly used, like maybe something with hydroxide or a metal.

The reaction with liquid Y produces a gas W. The gas has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. So, what gases fit that? Well, let's think about possible gases. If it's a molecule, maybe CO2? Wait, no, CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. Wait, but let's check the protons and neutrons.

Wait, the molecule of gas W must have equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible molecules. Let's take H2O: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So each H2O molecule has 2 protons from H and 8 from O. Total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons (since O is usually ^16O, 8 neutrons), each H has 0. So total neutrons 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons—no, not equal. So H2O isn't it.

Another possibility: NH3? No, because it's a gas, but when produced, maybe. Let me see. NH3 has N (7 protons) and 3 H (each 1). So total protons: 7 +3=10. Neutrons: N has 7-14? Wait, no, N is usually ^14N with 7 neutrons, but average is about 7. So 7 (N) + 3*(0 H) =7. So 10 protons, 7 neutrons. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe CH4? Let's see. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (12C). H has 1 each. So CH4 would have 6 +4=10 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) +4*0=6. So, 10 protons and 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule. Like O2? O2 has 8 protons each, so 16 total. Neutrons: each O has 8, so 16 in total. Oh, that's equal. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So W could be O2. But wait, would that make sense in the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different molecule. Let's think of other possibilities. What about CO? Carbon has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 → 14. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That would work. So CO is a possibility.

Wait, but when would CO be released? Maybe in a decomposition reaction. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is N2. N has 7 protons each, so N2 has 14. Neutrons: each N is 7 (14N), so 14. So that would also fit. So N2 is another possibility.

But let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently. Let's think of a common violent reaction. Maybe a metal reacting with an acid. For example, sodium reacting with water (H2O) violently, producing H2 gas. But wait, earlier we saw H2O isn't the gas. Or maybe potassium reacting with water, but again, the gas is H2.

Wait, but in this case, the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons → no. So that's not it.

Wait another thought: maybe the gas is something like H2S? No, H2S has 2 H (2 protons) and S (16 protons). So total 18 protons. Neutrons: S is 32-16=16. So 18 vs 16 → not equal. So no.

Hmm... Another possibility: maybe the gas is a noble gas. For example, He? He is monoatomic. So protons = 2, neutrons = 2 (since ^4He is common). Oh, that fits. He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So W could be He.

But when would He be released? Maybe in a reaction involving decomposition of something with He. Not sure.

Wait, going back to the precipitate G which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. What's 277 K? That's about 4°C (since 273 K is 0°C, 277 is 4°C). Hmm, what substances melt around there? Maybe something like water ice, but that's 273 K. Or maybe paraffin wax? No. Or perhaps something like B being solid CO2? No, CO2 sublimates at lower temps. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl has a high melting point. Wait, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Let me think: which metals have a melting point around 4°C? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that forms upon cooling. Wait, another thought: when a metal hydroxide is heated, perhaps it decomposes. For example, if G is a hydroxide precipitate, heating it might release water and form a metal oxide.

Wait, for example, if X is NaOH, and Y is something else. Wait, let's think about the reaction.

If X is NaOH reacting with liquid Y, which could be something like a salt solution. But if Y is, say, a carbonate, then the reaction might produce CO2. Hmm, but earlier I thought that W could be O2 or N2 or CO or something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid (like acetic acid, which is a carboxylic acid and can act as a keto acid) reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, what reaction could that be? Maybe esterification? Or perhaps X is something like NaOH, which could cause a neutralization reaction. Wait, but the product would have more than two O atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid.

Wait, if the product is something like a salt. For example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COOH, and X is NaOH, then the product would be CH3COO^-Na^+ plus water. The product would have the acetate ion, which has two oxygen atoms in the COO^- part. So maybe that's the case.

So if X is NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid would produce a salt with two oxygen atoms. That seems to fit.

But wait, earlier points: X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, for example, NaOH could have a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium has isotopes, but maybe the heavier one is not common. Or perhaps O is the one with a heavier isotope.

Wait, but the heavier isotope is incorporated into X. So perhaps, for example, X is made with oxygen-18 or something. But that might not change much.

Wait, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So NaOH is commonly used as a base in reactions, like saponification or hydrolysis. That fits.

So if X is NaOH, then Y might be something like a carbonate or another compound that reacts violently. Wait, NaOH reacting with something violently. Hmm, maybe it's reacting with a carbonated liquid, but that's not a violent reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like a water solution of a salt, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the gases. If X is NaOH and Y is maybe a carbonate, then the reaction could produce CO2. Let's see: NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2 NaOH + Na2CO3 → no, that's not a reaction. Wait, maybe NaOH and an acid. If Y is an acid, then the reaction would produce water and a salt. But that's not necessarily a violent reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a salt solution that when mixed with X (like NaOH) produces a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of CuSO4, then NaOH would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. That's a possibility. But does that reaction release a gas? I don't think so. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, going back to gas W. Let me think of another possibility. What about H2? No, because H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So no.

Alternatively, maybe W is a noble gas. Let's say it's Ar. Ar has 18 protons and 18 neutrons in ^40Ar. So that's equal. But when would Ar be released? Maybe in a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So G could be a hydroxide, and upon heating, it dehydrates to form an oxide. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, heating it would produce copper oxide and water. But then, what's B in that case? It would be water, but water's melting point is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. Wait, B's melting point is near 277 K. So 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, that's a bit higher than water's. Wait, maybe B is another substance. Or perhaps it's a hydrated salt that when heated releases water. Wait, maybe G is a basic carbonate or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide. When heated, it might release SO2 or another gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about B's melting point. 277 K is about 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Maybe paraffin wax? No, that varies. Or maybe something like camphor? No, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid form of a compound that's liquid at higher temps. Not too helpful.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium chloride. No, that melts at around 800°C. No. Or maybe it's a different salt. Alternatively, maybe B is something like a metal which has a low melting point.

Wait, another approach. What if X is a heavier isotope-containing substance, like something with deuterium. For example, if X is NaOD (a heavy water version), but not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, going back to the first part: the product of a certain keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. So, the product could be something like a carboxylic acid salt. For example, if the keto acid is acetic acid, and X is NaOH, then the product is sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na^+), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. That fits.

So, if X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), then what about the reaction with Y? Let's say Y is carbon dioxide. No, but that wouldn't produce a precipitate. Alternatively, Y could be a solution that when mixed with NaOH produces a precipitate. For example, Y is FeCl3 solution. NaOH reacts with FeCl3 to produce Fe(OH)3 precipitate. Then, when heated, Fe(OH)3 decomposes to Fe2O3 and H2O. So B would be H2O. But the melting point of H2O is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. Hmm, 273 is 0°C, 277 is 4°C. So maybe B is a different compound. Wait, perhaps it's not water.

Wait, when Fe(OH)3 is heated, it decomposes to Fe2O3 and H2O. So the gas would be water vapor, but upon cooling, it would condense. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate? No, because when carbonate reacts with acid, it produces CO2, but in this case, Y is liquid, perhaps an acid. Let me think again.

If X is NaOH, and Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, mixing them might not produce a precipitate. Hmm. Alternatively, if Y is a salt of a weak acid, like Na2SiO3, then NaOH might not react. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate. For example, AlCl3 and NaOH react to form Al(OH)3. Then, when Al(OH)3 is heated, it becomes Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be H2O, which melts at 273 K, but the problem states it's near 277 K. That's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is magnesium hydroxide. Mg(OH)2. Heating it would give MgO and H2O. Same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. What if the precipitate forms from a reaction other than hydroxide. Maybe sulfide? No, since Y is a liquid.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate. Then, NaOH wouldn't react unless it's with an acid.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think about the gas W again. If W is CO2, then maybe Y is a carbonate. So X is NaOH, Y is a carbonate solution. The reaction would be 2 NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2 Na2CO3 (wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O. No, that's not producing a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a stronger base. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and when X (NaOH) is added, it produces a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. For example, CaCO3 is not very soluble, but if Y is CaCl2 and X is Na2CO3, then Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3 precipitate + 2 NaCl. Wait, but in that case, X would be Na2CO3, not NaOH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a metal ion that reacts with X to form a precipitate. Let's say Y is CuSO4 solution, and X is NaOH. Then, X + Y → Cu(OH)2 precipitate. Then, when heated, it would decompose into CuO and H2O. So B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K. But the question says B is close to 277 K. So that's a bit higher. Maybe the precipitate is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a hydroxide already, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the isotopes. The problem says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X is made of elements with at least one heavier isotope. For example, if X is NaOH, then Na has isotopes (like ^23Na, ^24Na, ^25Na), O has ^16O, ^17O, ^18O, and H has ^1H, ^2H. So maybe X is using a heavier isotope of O or H.

But how does that affect the cumulative atomic masses? Well, the question says to sum the masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for each element in X, find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then add those sums for all elements in X.

Wait, but X is a compound, so it's made of multiple elements. So, for each element in X, calculate the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses, and then add those for all elements.

So, first, identify the elements in X. Let me assume X is NaOH. So elements are Na, O, H.

For each element:

Na: lightest isotope is ^23Na (mass ~23), heaviest is ^25Na (~25). Sum is 23 +25=48.

O: lightest is ^16O (16), heaviest is ^18O (18). Sum 16+18=34.

H: lightest is ^1H (1), heaviest is ^2H (2). Sum 1+2=3.

So total would be 48 (Na) +34 (O) +3 (H) = 85. But the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So that can't be right. So maybe X is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think again.

If the product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe X is something like methanol, but that's not a reagent in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: What if X is potassium permanganate (KMnO4)? No, but that's more of an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products.

The reaction of a keto acid with X gives a product with two O atoms. Let's think of a reaction where a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with something to form a compound with two O's. Maybe X is a base, causing neutralization. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. The product is acetate ion, which has two O's in the COO^- group. That fits.

So X is NaOH, as before.

Now, back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B (melting point ~277 K). So, the reaction must be NaOH reacting with Y to produce a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate or carbonate, but I'm not seeing it yet.

Another thought: Maybe Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is AgNO3 solution, and X is NaOH. Then, they would form AgOH, which is not very stable, but perhaps decomposes to AgO or something. Alternatively, maybe it forms a precipitate like AgOH or Ag2O. When heated, Ag2O decomposes into Ag and O2. But O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule, so O2 is O-O. Wait, O has 8 protons, so O2 has 16. Neutrons: 8 per O, so 16 in total. So W would be O2, which fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's see: X is NaOH, Y is AgNO3. Then, NaOH + AgNO3 → AgOH (precipitate) + NaNO3. But AgOH is unstable and typically decomposes to AgO or Ag2O. Then, when heated, Ag2O would decompose to Ag metal and O2 gas. So gas W would be O2. Then, B would be Ag, which has a melting point of around 961°C. That's not close to 277 K (~4°C). So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a sulfide. But then, NaOH + a sulfide would produce a precipitate of a metal hydroxide and H2S gas. But H2S has 2 H's (2 protons) and 32 neutrons (S has 32?). So 2 vs 32 → not equal. So W can't be H2S.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the precipitate G. Upon heating, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So B is a solid that's liquid at 277 K. Wait, no, melting point is the temperature at which it turns from solid to liquid. So if B melts at ~277 K, it's solid below that, liquid above. So the melting point is about 4°C.

What solid has a melting point around 4°C? Maybe something like paraffin wax?
