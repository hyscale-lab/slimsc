Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

So the problem says we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity with radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity, r, is less than R, which makes sense because it's inside. Now, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But wait, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is given as l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. 

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you have a charge inside a conducting shell, the conductor's charges will redistribute. But wait, the conductor here is neutral initially. So what happens when we put a charge inside the cavity?

Oh right, the inner surface of the conductor will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have an induced charge as well. Wait, let me think. The conductor was neutral, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must develop a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance out. 

So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there should be due to the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface that includes P. Since the conductor's outer charge is +q, the field outside should be similar to that of a point charge +q at the center, right?

Wait, but the charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity, not at the center. So does that affect the field outside? Oh, right! For a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will distribute such that the field outside depends only on the total charge, regardless of where the internal charge is placed. Because the conductor's material allows the charges to move freely. So the electric field outside the conductor should behave as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So according to Gauss's Law, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / L². Since Q_enclosed is +q, as the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². 

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So I'm thinking that's the correct answer. 

Wait, but why are the other options present? Let's see. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That seems like it's considering the distance from the charge inside the cavity to point P, but that's not right because the induced charges on the outer surface shield the interior. So external points shouldn't feel the field due to the internal charge in that way. 

Option C has (l + s cosθ) squared, which seems like it's taking the sum of distances, but that doesn't fit with the idea that the field outside is from the total charge on the conductor. Option D uses l squared, which would be the case if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but the conductor's induced charges make the field outside depend on the conductor's total charge, not the position of the internal charge. 

So yeah, I think the right choice is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is $+q$.

Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at point $P$, which is outside the conductor, is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface. The field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option C** involve distances dependent on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the conductor's outer surface, not on the position of the internal charge or the geometry of the cavity.
- **Option D** incorrectly uses $l^2$ instead of $L^2$, which would only apply if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but the conductor's induced charges shield the interior and determine the field outside.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
