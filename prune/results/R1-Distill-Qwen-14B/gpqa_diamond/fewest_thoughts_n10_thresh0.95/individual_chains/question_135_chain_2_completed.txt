Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The Lagrangian interaction is provided, but I'm not sure if I need to focus on that right away. Let me read it again.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse this. So, it's a term involving fermions interacting with the boson X. The boson X probably is a massive scalar field because it's bosonic.

Wait, the interaction term looks like λ multiplied by some product of fermion fields. Maybe X is a scalar field that interacts with fermions. So the interaction is something like Yukawa coupling, perhaps? Because Yukawa terms usually have a scalar multiplied by a fermion bilinear.

But the main point here is to find the possible decay products of X. For a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion pair's mass should be less than the mass of the boson, right? Because in decays, the rest mass of the products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

So the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, the fermions must be allowed by the interaction terms in the Lagrangian.

Wait, the Lagrangian has ψ_f, so the fermion fields are ψ_f. So which fermions are involved? The interaction term must involve fermion fields that can annihilate or create fermion pairs. So the possible decay products are fermions that can be created by the interaction term.

Looking at the interaction term: it's -λ f f-bar X, perhaps? I'm not entirely sure about the notation, but I think it's something like scalar X coupling to a pair of fermions. So the decay X → f f-bar should be allowed if the interaction has that term.

Wait, the general term for Yukawa coupling is L_int = - g φ ψ ψ, where φ is the scalar (boson), and ψ are fermions. So in this case, the interaction term is between X and fermions, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the interaction allows.

So the possible decay modes are any fermion species that the X couples to. But also, their masses have to be less than the X's mass.

The problem is giving options A to D, each listing possible decay channels. So which fermions have masses below 6 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.004 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. When considering a fermion pair, the sum is 2m_f, but actually, when a boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the combined mass is 2m_f times each. Wait, no, the rest mass of each is m_f, so the total invariant mass is 2m_f. So for X to decay into f and anti-f, the mass of X must be at least 2m_f.

Wait, wait no. Actually, each fermion has mass m_f. When the boson X (mass M) decays into two fermions, each has energy, but their rest mass is m_f each. So the condition is that M ≥ 2m_f. So the maximum possible m_f is M/2. So for M =6 GeV, m_f can be up to 3 GeV.

Looking again at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → 2m = 0.001 GeV <6 → allowed
- μ: ~0.105 GeV → 2m~0.21 <6 → allowed
- τ: ~1.777 GeV → 2m ~3.554 GeV. Wait, 2m should be less than or equal to X's mass. X is 6 GeV, so τ can be produced as a pair since 3.554 <6.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, τ is about 1.777 GeV, so 2m is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into τ+ τ-.

But what about the quarks? Because in decay processes, quarks are confined, so they can't be produced as free particles. So the decay X → q q-bar is allowed only if the quarks can form bound states or if the decay is via a process that doesn't require free quarks. But in the Standard Model, for example, the Higgs can decay into fermions, including quarks. But for X to decay into quarks, perhaps the interaction allows it. But when considering observed decay products, quarks would have to hadronize, but for this question, perhaps the focus is on the possible fermion pairs, not their detection.

Wait, the problem says the boson X is interacting with fermions, but do the fermions include quarks? The interaction term is L = -λ f f-bar X. So if the fermions are quarks, then X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs. So for example, X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, etc., as long as the mass condition is met.

But the mass of the top quark is way above 6 GeV (about 173 GeV), so X can't decay into t t-bar. The bottom quark is ~4.13 GeV, so 2m is ~8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, wait: 4.13 GeV per b quark. So 2m would be 8.26 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So 2m =8.26 >6 → X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait: No, wait. The X has a mass of 6 GeV. Each b quark is about 4.13 GeV. So 4.13 *2 is 8.26, which is larger than 6. So that's not allowed. So the decay X → b b-bar is not allowed.

Similarly, c quark is ~1.27 GeV, so 2m is ~2.54 GeV <6 → allowed.

So possible quark decays are u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

But wait, what about other fermions like the tau? Tau is about 1.777 GeV each. So 2m is ~3.554 GeV <6 → allowed. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

What about the charged leptons: e, mu, tau.

So possible fermion pairs are e+, e-; mu+, mu-; tau+, tau-; and all the quark pairs except b and t (since t is way too heavy, and b is too heavy as well).

So the possible decay modes are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar.

But wait, what about the masses of the fermions in the interaction term? Because the interaction term is given, it's possible that the Lagrangian only allows certain fermions to couple to X.

Looking back at the Lagrangian provided:

L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it. So f f-bar is some combination. Wait, perhaps ψ_f(y) is the fermion field, and f is a flavor index? Or perhaps it's a typo and the term is something like ψ_f^dagger ψ_f?

Wait, the term is written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). That's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps it's a Yukawa-like term where the scalar X is multiplied by a fermion bilinear, like ψ_f^dagger ψ_f.

Wait, I think the interaction term must be of the form X * ψ_f^dagger ψ_f. Because that would be a scalar (X) times a scalar (ψ_f^dagger ψ_f), which is Lorentz scalar.

So, in that case, the interaction is X coupling to the fermion number density. So for each possible flavor f of fermion, the X can decay into f f-bar.

But the problem is, which fermions are allowed? Because the interaction term must have ψ_f fields. So if the Lagrangian includes ψ_f for all possible fermion flavors, then X can decay into any of them. But perhaps the Lagrangian is written in a way that only certain fermions are included.

Wait, the problem statement says "The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So perhaps the interaction is written as X coupling to all possible fermions, as the Lagrangian includes ψ_f, which is a general notation for fermions. But perhaps in reality, the coupling is only to specific types of fermions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is written in a way that only certain fermions are included. Wait, the term is written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the notation is that f is a field. That would make less sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the interaction is something like X ψ_f^† ψ_f. So the X couples to all fermions ψ_f.

If that's the case, then the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided that the mass allows it.

So, considering that, and the masses:

X mass =6 GeV.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-: allowed,

mu+ mu-: allowed,

tau+ tau-: allowed,

u u-bar: allowed,

d d-bar: allowed,

s s-bar: allowed,

c c-bar: allowed,

b b-bar: not allowed because 2m_b=8.26 GeV>6 GeV,

t t-bar: way over, so no.

So possible decay modes are:

e+, e-,

mu+, mu-,

tau+, tau-,

u, u-bar,

d, d-bar,

s, s-bar,

c, c-bar.

Which of the options include these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, e+ e-.

Wait, but b b-bar is not allowed because 2m_b>6 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes all the allowed fermions except the b. So B is a candidate.

Option C: same as B but includes t t-bar. So can't be, as t is too heavy.

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e.

Again, includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me make sure. The interaction terms: if the Lagrangian is written as X coupling to all fermions, then any fermion pair can be a decay product as long as 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the fermions that can be produced are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of these except the b. So option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decays are governed by the condition that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must not exceed the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses and Decay Constraints**:
   - The fermion masses are approximately:
     - \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_b \approx 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \),
     - \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must be satisfied.

2. **Allowed Fermion Pairs**:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2m_b = 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

3. **Interaction Term and Decay Modes**:
   The interaction term \( \mathcal{L} \) implies that \( X \) couples to all fermions. Therefore, \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass constraint \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) is satisfied. This includes \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), and \( c \bar{c} \), but excludes \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
