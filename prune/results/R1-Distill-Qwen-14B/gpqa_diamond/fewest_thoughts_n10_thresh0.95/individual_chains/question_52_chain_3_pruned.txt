Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change. So the star's parameters are given as 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. 

They're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

Wait, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when spots are there, the ratio is lower, meaning that without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without)/(ratio with) = some number greater than 1.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
- n1 is the number in level 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, so when T is lower (since Teff is 5500 K with spots). So the ratio n2/n1 should decrease because the exponential term becomes smaller as T decreases.

The question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. Let me denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2. So we're looking for R1/R2.

Hmm, let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The ratio R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, but wait: if the ratio R decreases when T decreases, then R1 is for T1=6000 K, R2 is for T2=5500 K. So R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] 

The (g2/g1) cancels out because it's the same in both ratios. So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, let's compute that exponent:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

But I need to find ΔE in terms of the wavelength given. Because the transition is at 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms. So the energy difference between the levels is the energy of the photon emitted during the transition. The energy E is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = hc/λ.

Putting it all together, the exponent becomes:

( hc/(λ k) ) * ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

Wait, but actually, the exponent for R1/R2 is [ (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].

Let me compute that step by step. Let's compute the exponent:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (hc/(λ k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So substituting the values:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

T1 = 6000 K
T2 = 5500 K

So let's compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Difference: 0.000015151

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1.

Now, compute (h c)/(λ k):

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by λ k: λ is 1448e-10 m, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (h c)/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute denominator: 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = approx 1.448 *1.38 = 2.000 (approx), so 2e-30.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
Multiply by k=1.38e-23 J/K: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30.

1.448 * 1.38: Let's compute 1.4 *1.38= 1.932. 0.048*1.38=0.06624. So total ≈ 1.99824. So approximately 2.00e-30.

So h c / (lambda*k) = 1.9878e-25 / 2e-30 = (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9939 * 1e5 ≈ 9.939e4.

Wait, no, wait: 1e-25 divided by 1e-30 is 1e5. So 1.9878e-25 / 2e-30 = (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 ≈ (0.9939) * 1e5 ≈ 99390. So approximately 9.939e4.

So now, the exponent is (9.939e4) * (0.000015151) 

Wait, 0.000015151 is 1.5151e-5.

Multiply 9.939e4 * 1.5151e-5:

9.939e4 is 99390, 1.5151e-5 is 0.000015151.

Multiplying: 99390 * 0.000015151 = let's compute 99390 * 1.5151e-5.

Calculate 99390 * 1.5151e-5.

Let me compute this:

99390 * 1.5151e-5 = (99390) * (1.5151 / 1e5) )= (99390 * 1.5151) / 1e5.

Compute 99390 * 1.5151. Let's approximate:

99390 ≈ 99,000.

99,000 * 1.5151 ≈ 99,000 * 1.5 = 148,500. Plus 99,000 * 0.0151 ≈ 1,494. So total ≈ 149,994.

But 99390 is a bit more than 99,000. Let's compute exact:

99390 * 1.5151 = ?

Let me compute 99390 * 1.5 = 149,085.

99390 * 0.0151 = 99390 * 0.01 = 993.9, 99390 * 0.0051 = 506.  So 993.9 + 506 = 1,499.9.

So total is 149,085 + 1,499.9 = 150,584.9.

So 150,584.9 / 1e5 = 1.505849.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5058.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.5058) ≈ e^1.5058.

Wait, what's e^1.5058?

I know e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^0.5≈1.6487, e^1.5≈4.4817. Let me check e^1.5058:

1.5 is about 4.4817, and 0.0058 is a small addition. Let me approximate using Taylor series or a calculator approach.

We can compute e^x where x=1.5058. Let me think, e^1.5 is 4.4817, e^1.5058 is a bit more.

The derivative of e^x is e^x. So the change from 1.5 to 1.5058 is a delta x of 0.0058. So approximate e^1.5058 ≈ e^1.5 + e^1.5 * 0.0058.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817. So 4.4817 * 0.0058 ≈ 0.0260. Adding that to 4.4817 gives about 4.5077.

So approximately 4.5077. So the ratio R1/R2 is about 4.5.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculation again because I might have made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, the exponent was (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ?

Wait, let me double-check the math earlier. The ratio R1 is for T1 and R2 for T2. So R1/R2 is [n2/n1 at T1] / [n2/n1 at T2 ].

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1) )) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T2) )) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] )

Wait, that's correct. So the exponent is positive because 1/T2 < 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative, but multiplied by ΔE/(k), which is positive, so the exponent is negative times positive? Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, no, wait: 1/T2 is less than 1/T1 because T2 < T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is negative. So the exponent is [ (ΔE/k) * (negative number) ].

Wait, no, wait, no: in the ratio R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 is negative, so the exponent is negative. So the exponent is negative, which means the ratio R1/R2 is exp(negative), which is a number less than 1. But the question says that the ratio R (n2/n1) decreases when spots are present. So when T is lower, R is lower. So when T1=6000 (no spots) and T2=5500 (spots), R1 is higher than R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to the exponent, it's negative, so R1/R2 = e^negative number, which would be less than 1. That contradicts our expectation.

Wait, that can't be right. So somewhere I must have messed up the setup.

Let me reevaluate the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when E2 > E1, which is the case for an upward transition (since photons are emitted when electrons drop from higher to lower energy levels), the exponent is negative. So higher temperatures make the ratio larger because the exponential term is larger.

Wait, so let's say E2 is higher than E1. So E2-E1 is positive. So at higher temperatures (T1=6000), the exponent is - (positive number)/(k T), which is a less negative number. So the exponential term is larger—so n2/n1 increases with temperature. So when the star has higher Teff, the ratio n2/n1 is higher.

In the problem, when the star has spots, Teff is lower (5500 K) so the ratio n2/n1 decreases. So R1 (6000 K) is higher than R2 (5500 K). So R1/R2 is a number greater than 1.

But according to the earlier calculation, the exponent was positive, leading to R1/R2 = e^(positive) >1. Which is correct.

Wait, wait, but in the calculation, the exponent was (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) = (something positive) times a negative number. So the exponent was negative, leading to e^negative, which is less than 1, implying R1/R2 <1, which contradicts our expectation.

So I must have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me re-express the ratio:

R1 = n2/n1 at T1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = n2/n1 at T2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, 1/(T2) is less than 1/(T1), so this term inside the exponential is (ΔE/k) * (negative number), so the exponent is negative.

Thus, R1/R2 = e^(-something positive) → which is less than 1. But this contradicts our earlier conclusion that R1 is larger than R2 and thus R1/R2 >1.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the energy
