Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.

So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the atomic mass. But wait, how do I find that? I think I need the atomic weight. Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait, each u is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So the mass m = 6 u.

But wait, actually, I should double-check that. Sometimes, isotopes have slightly different masses. But for this problem, maybe we can approximate it as 6 u. So m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

Next, the speed v is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 0.96 * 3e8 = 2.88e8 m/s.

Now, the problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, right? So E = gamma * m c^2.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Let me compute that. Substituting v = 0.96c, so v^2/c^2 is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714... Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me calculate gamma step by step.

v = 0.96c, so beta = 0.96. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784). What's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think. 0.28^2 = 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy is m c^2. The mass m is 6 u. Let me compute that. 6 u * c^2.

Wait, but wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Oh right! Because I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Alternatively, m c^2 = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this. So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, let's compute:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857 GeV
3.5714 * 0.589 = let's see. 3.5714 * 0.5 is 1.7857, 3.5714 * 0.089 is approximately 0.3172. So total about 2.1029.

So 17.857 + 2.1029 ≈ 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.589:

3 *5.589 = 16.767
0.5714 *5.589: let's compute 0.5 *5.589=2.7945, 0.0714 *5.589≈0.4005. So total 2.7945 + 0.4005 ≈3.195.

So total E ≈ 16.767 +3.195 = 19.962 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 3.5714 is (approx 25/7, which is 3.5714). So 25/7 *5.589 = ?

Let me compute 5.589 * 25 = 139.725, then divide by 7: 139.725 /7 ≈ 19.9607 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option B is 23.069, that's higher, D is 21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me double-check the mass calculation.

Ah, wait a second. X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. But wait, does the mass of Li-6 equal exactly 6 u? Or is it slightly different?

I think I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, but I don't have exact data here. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that the mass is 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 6.941 u (the atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol), but that would be for Li-7, which has 4 neutrons. Wait, no, wait: Li-6 has 3 neutrons, Li-7 has 4. So the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Wait, I think I've heard that before. So perhaps the mass is 6.015 u instead of exactly 6 u.

So let me recalculate. m = 6.015 u. Then, m c^2 is 6.015 * 931.5 MeV. Let's compute that.

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

0.015 * 931.5 =13.9725 MeV, which is 0.0139725 GeV.

So total m c^2 is 5.589 +0.0139725=5.6029725 GeV.

Hmm, so m c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

So then E = gamma * 5.603 GeV. Gamma is ≈3.5714.

So 3.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3 *5.603=16.809 GeV.

0.5714 *5.603 = approximately 3.199 GeV.

Adding together: 16.809 +3.199=20.008 GeV.

So approximately 20.008 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

Beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Because 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So m c² is 6.015 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.015 *931.5 = let's compute.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015 *931.5=13.9725.

Total 5589+13.9725=5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6029725 =16.8089175

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.6029725 =2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725 ≈ let's compute 0.07 *5.6029725=0.392208075, and 0.00142857 *5.6029725≈0.007999999. So total ≈0.392208075 +0.008≈0.400208075.

So 0.57142857 *5.6029725 ≈2.80148625 +0.400208075 ≈3.2016943.

So the total E is 16.8089175 +3.2016943 ≈20.0106118 GeV.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV: too low.

B)23.069 GeV: way too high.

C)20.132 GeV: close to our 20.01, but a bit higher.

D)21.419 GeV: higher than our value.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Wait, perhaps the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of 6.015 u. Wait, but wait, the mass of a nucleus is the mass of the constituent protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but in this case, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is given as 6.941 u, but that's for Li-7.

Wait, no, wait. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 +3=6 nucleons, so Li-6. Its atomic mass is approximately 6.015 u.

But I'm getting about 20.01 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the multiplication.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725 more accurately.

Let me write it out as 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6029725 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0029725 ≈ let's see:

0.0029725 = approx 0.003, so 3.57142857 *0.003 =0.010714285.

So 3.57142857 *0.6029725 ≈2.14285714 +0.010714285 =2.153571425.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.153571425 =20.010714275 GeV.

So approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Now, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So 20.0107 is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation. Because I approximated gamma as 3.57142857. But is that precise enough?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma with more decimal places.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Beta is 0.96.

So 1 - beta^2 =1 - (0.96)^2 =1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's precise. So perhaps the issue is with the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6.015 u. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, let's find the exact value of Li-6's atomic mass. I think it's about 6.0151228 u. From my memory, the exact value for Li-6 is approximately 6.0151228 u.

So m =6.0151228 u.

So m c² =6.0151228 *931.5 MeV.

Compute:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

0.0151228 *931.5 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.0051228 *931.5 =approx 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, and 0.0001228*931.5≈0.1143. So total ≈4.6575 +0.1143=4.7718 MeV.

So m c² =5.589 GeV + (9.315 +4.7718) MeV.

Wait, 9.315 +4.7718=14.0868 MeV, which is 0.0140868 GeV.

So m c² =5.589 +0.0140868=5.6030868 GeV.

So now, E =3.57142857 *5.6030868 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6030868.

3 *5.6030868 =16.8092604 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.6030868.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.6030868=2.8015434.

0.07142857 *5.6030868.

Compute 0.07 *5.6030868=0.392216076.

0.00142857 *5.6030868≈0.007999999.

So total 0.392216076 +0.007999999≈0.400216075.

So 2.8015434 +0.400216075=3.201759475 GeV.

So total E=16.8092604 +3.201759475=20.011019875 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I miscalculate anything?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a proton, but no, the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" which usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or perhaps it's the total energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

In particle physics, the energy in colliders is typically the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, no, I think RHIC's energy refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon or per nucleus. Wait, no, the collider's energy is the total energy each beam has. Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think.

Wait, in colliders, the energy mentioned is usually the kinetic energy added to the rest mass energy. Or sometimes, when they refer to the beam energy, they might mean the total energy (gamma m c²). Hmm, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, let's think. The total energy E is gamma m c². The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c². So the problem could be asking for the kinetic energy.

If the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So gamma is 3.57142857. So gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.6030868 GeV.

Compute that.

2 *5.6030868=11.2061736 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.6030868.

0.5 *5.6030868=2.8015434.

0.07142857 *5.6030868≈0.400216075.

So total 2.8015434 +0.400216075=3.201759475 GeV.

So K=11.2061736 +3.201759475=14.407933 GeV.

Which is about 14.408 GeV. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

So back to E=20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma using the exact value of beta=0.96.

Gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

Hmm, that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.0151228 u, but maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value from the periodic table.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151228 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Wait, perhaps using more precise multiplication.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030868:

=3 *5.6030868 +0.57142857*5.6030868

=16.8092604 + (0.5*5.6030868 +0.07142857*5.6030868)

0.5 *5.6030868 =2.8015434.

0.07142857 *5.6030868: Let's compute this more accurately.

0.07142857 is 1/14. So 5.6030868 /14 = approx 0.400218343.

So 2.8015434 +0.400218343 =3.201761743.

So total E =16.8092604 +3.201761743=20.01102214 GeV.

Approximately 20.011 GeV.

So why is option C 20.132 GeV? That's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the mass is 6.941 u, which would be Li-7. No, the problem says 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Let me double-check the beta.

Wait, the speed is 0.96c, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the options are in GeV, which is per nucleus.

Wait, another possibility: the problem might have considered the rest mass as 6 * 1.67e-27 kg, the mass of a proton, but that's incorrect. Because a neutron is slightly heavier than a proton. So the nucleus's mass is more than 6 * proton mass.

Wait, but that approach would be wrong. So perhaps I did everything correctly.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation is about 20.01 GeV. The discrepancy is about 0.12 GeV, which is about 120 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me recalculate using the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Beta is 0.96. So gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation of 1/sqrt(0.0784) could give a more precise gamma.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4. Let me see, sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.57142857 exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of natural units or use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy to be calculated. But earlier that gave about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that would be way lower.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Given that my calculation gives approximately 20.01 GeV, and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher, perhaps I should check if I missed a step.

Wait, wait! Could the question be asking for the total energy in the center-of-mass frame? No, because the speed is given, which is a frame where the nucleus is moving at 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy multiplied by 2, but that would make it ~40 GeV, which is not one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. Wait, no, c is a constant. I used 3e8 m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest mass in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for 3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator:

3.57142857 *5.6030868 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Hmm, 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6030868.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0030868 = approx 0.0110293.

So 2.14285714 +0.0110293=2.15388644.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.15388644=20.01102929 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

So the only option close is C)20.132 GeV, but it's off by about 0.12 GeV. Hmm. Maybe the problem requires more precise calculation of gamma or uses a different approximation for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of relativistic energy without the rest mass, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation using exact numbers.

Let me recompute E = gamma * m c².

gamma = 3.57142857.

m c²=6.0151228 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.0151228 *931.5= let me compute this accurately.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0151228 *931.5: 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.0051228 *931.5= let's compute:

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0001228 *931.5=0.1143.

So 4.6575 +0.1143=4.7718.

So 0.0151228 *931.5=9.315 +4.7718=14.0868 MeV =0.0140868 GeV.

So m c²=5.589 GeV +0.0140868 GeV=5.6030868 GeV.

Now, E=3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Let me compute this again.

3.57142857 *5.6030868.

= (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6030868

=3*5.6030868 +0.57142857*5.6030868

=16.8092604 + (0.5*5.6030868 + 0.07142857*5.6030868)

0.5 *5.6030868 =2.8015434.

0.07142857*5.6030868: 0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.6030868 /14 =0.400218343.

So 2.8015434 +0.400218343 =3.201761743.

So E=16.8092604 +3.201761743 =20.01102214 GeV.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is different. Let me think: the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. So perhaps I should compute using more precise figures.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the energy in terms of the kinetic energy. Let me check.

If the energy is the kinetic energy, K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.6030868 GeV.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.6030868.

2 *5.6030868=11.2061736.

0.57142857 *5.6030868=3.201761743.

So K=11.2061736 +3.201761743=14.40793534 GeV.

Which is about 14.408 GeV, which isn't an option here.

So perhaps the energy is indeed the total energy, 20.01 GeV. But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise gamma and m c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, which is exact.

So gamma= 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, gamma is 3.571428571428571.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation gamma ≈ 3.6.

So 3.6 *5.6030868= let's compute.

3 *5.6030868=16.8092604.

0.6 *5.6030868=3.36185208.

So total 16.8092604 +3.36185208=20.17111248 GeV.

Which is about 20.171 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but my calculation isn't matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6030868 in a different way.

Let me do it step by step:

3.57142857 *5.6030868.

Break it down:

=3 *5.6030868 + 0.57142857 *5.6030868.

3 *5.6030868 =16.8092604.

Now, 0.57142857 *5.6030868.

0.5 *5.6030868 =2.8015434.

0.07142857 *5.6030868 =approx 0.400218343.

So 2.8015434 +0.400218343 =3.201761743.

So total E=16.8092604 +3.201761743=20.01102214 GeV.

Hmm, I see no mistake in this calculation.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation shows about 20.01 GeV. Perhaps the problem expects an approximate value, and the options are rounded.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the approximation that gamma is 3.57, leading to E=3.57 *5.6030868 GeV.

3.57 *5.6030868 = let me compute.

3 *5.6030868=16.8092604.

0.57 *5.6030868=3.193757.

So total=16.8092604+3.193757=20.0030174 GeV.

Still around 20.003 GeV.

Hmm, I'm not sure why the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation using the exact figures.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the approximate value of gamma as 3.57 instead of 3.5714.

So 3.57 *5.6030868.

3 *5.6030868=16.8092604.

0.57 *5.6030868=3.193757.

Total:16.8092604+3.193757=20.0030174 GeV.

Still about 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, but the calculation leads to approximately 20.01 GeV. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: the mass of Li-6 is 6.0151228 u. So m c² is 6.0151228 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 6.0151228 *931.5 exactly.

6.0151228 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0151228 *931.5=14.0868 MeV.

So m c²=5589+14.0868=5603.0868 MeV=5.6030868 GeV.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E using more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of gamma = 3.57142857, and m c² =5.6030868 GeV, leading to E=20.011 GeV, which is not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. Oh wait, the speed is 0.96c, which is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c, such as 3e8 m/s, which is what I used.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula in terms of natural units.

In natural units (c=1), E = gamma * m.

m in GeV/c² would be 6.0151228 u ×931.5 MeV/u ×1e-3 GeV/MeV =6.0151228 *0.9315 GeV ≈5.603 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Which gives around 20.01 GeV.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation shows 20.01 GeV. I think I must have made a mistake in my calculations, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the gamma calculation. Let me compute beta =0.96.

So beta =0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass in kilograms and then converting to GeV.

Wait, m =6.0151228 u ×1.660539e-27 kg/u.

So m =6.0151228 ×1.660539e-27 = approximately 9.96e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

m c² =9.96e-27 kg*(3e8)^2 =9.96e-27 *9e16= 8.964e-10 J.

Now, 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so E=8.964e-10 J /1.602e-19 J/eV =5.598e9 eV =5.598 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I had 5.603 GeV. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding in the calculation. So m c²≈5.598 GeV.

Then, E= gamma * mc²=3.57142857 *5.598 GeV.

3.57142857 *5 =17.857 GeV.

3.57142857 *0.598= let's compute.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.098 *3.57142857≈0.349999999.

So 1.785714285 +0.349999999=2.135714284 GeV.

So E=17.857 +2.135714284=19.9927 GeV.

Approximately 19.993 GeV.

Which rounds to about 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 GeV. The closest is C)20.132.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute without approximations.

Wait, but I think I've spent enough time on this. The calculation of 20.011 GeV is the most accurate I can get. Since option C is 20.132, which is the closest, I think that must be the intended answer, perhaps due to different approximations in the problem setup.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) moves at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate the total energy \( E \) using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 0.96c \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \) (atomic mass units). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.015 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5602.9725 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.603 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.603 = 3 \times 5.603 + 0.5714 \times 5.603
\]

\[
3 \times 5.603 = 16.809 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.603 \approx 3.202 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 16.809 + 3.202 = 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
