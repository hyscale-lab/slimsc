Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't live very long because it decays quickly. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay length and see which option it matches.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like the mean decay distance L is equal to gamma times c times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau? Tau is the mean lifetime of the particle, which is related to the width Γ. I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is on the order of Planck's constant. So Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and tau is the uncertainty in time. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh but wait, the actual relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, particles can't have a lifetime longer than the uncertainty principle allows. So that's how we get the proper lifetime. But since the particle is moving, we have to consider its velocity and gamma factor to get the mean decay distance.

So putting it all together, the mean decay distance L is gamma * c * tau. But tau is ħ / Γ, so substituting, L = gamma * c * (ħ / Γ).

But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E / (m c²). Since E is the total energy, which is given as 8 GeV. The mass energy is m_X c², which is 1.2 GeV. So gamma would be E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, no. Wait, the total energy E is 8 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²). Since E = gamma m c², so gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., which is 20/3. So that's correct.

Now, let's compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute tau: tau = ħ / Γ.

But what units should I use here? I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me think in terms of converting everything into SI units.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait no, let me check: Planck's constant h is about 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. Since ħ = h/(2π), which is about 1.055 × 10^-34 J·s. But when working in GeV, it's easier to use the value in GeV·s. So, 1 GeV is 1.602 × 10^-10 J. So ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, I remember that value as approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, converting that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that again: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes.

Now, gamma is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.666666...

So gamma is approximately 6.6666667.

Now, L = gamma * c * tau.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So putting it all together:

L = 6.6666667 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Calculating the numbers step by step.

First, multiply gamma and c:

6.6666667 * 3e8 = 20e8, because 6.6666667 is 20/3, so 20/3 *3e8 = 20e8.

Wait, 20/3 *3e8 = 20e8? Wait, 3e8 * (20/3) = (3e8 *20)/3 = 20e8. Yes.

So 20e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

20e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24

20 * 2.056875 = about 41.1375.

1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16.

So 41.1375e-16 m.

Wait, that's 4.11375e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait: 41.1375e-16 is the same as 4.11375e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.0223 ×10^-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655 ×10^-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation gave me approximately 4.11375e-15 m. The closest option is B (4.0655e-15) or perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me check the calculations again for possible mistakes.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating the numbers.

Let's recompute tau more accurately.

tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s.

Wait no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) ) e-25.

6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 ÷ 0.32.

Let me compute that:

0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.582, so 20.56875 times 0.32 is 6.582. So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau is 20.56875e-25 s? Or wait, 6.582e-25 /0.32 = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Which is what I had before.

So that's correct.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666667.

So the product gamma * c is 6.66666667 * 3e8 m/s = 20e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 20e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm, 20 * 2.056875 is 41.1375.

20e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 41.1375e (8 -24) )= 41.1375e-16 m.

Which is 4.11375e-15 m.

Wait, but the options are B)4.0655e-15 and C)5.0223e-15.

Hmm, why am I getting 4.11375e-15, which isn't exactly any of the options. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

gamma = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.6666667. Correct.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) )= 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Gamma * c tau: 6.6666667 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should do the calculation using exact numbers without approximating early.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the relation between the mean decay length and width more accurately.

Wait, another approach: The mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ.

The total decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait a second, earlier I thought L = gamma * c tau, but perhaps it's gamma * beta * c * tau, because particles move at velocity v = beta c.

Oh right! I forgot beta! Oh that's a big mistake. So the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Beta is v/c, and for a relativistic particle, v is approximately c, so beta is close to 1. But to be precise, we should calculate beta.

So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ) ?

Wait, no.

Wait, relativistic equations: gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta²).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Given gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So 1/gamma² is (3/20)² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So now, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So let me calculate this.

gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that.

6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 is approx 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 is approx 0.660.

So total is about 6.5922.

But let me do it more accurately.

6.6666667 * 0.9887:

= (6 + 0.6666667) * 0.9887

= 6 *0.9887 + 0.6666667 *0.9887

6 *0.9887=5.9322

0.6666667 *0.9887=approx 0.660.

So total approx 5.9322 + 0.660= 6.5922.

But let me compute more accurately:

0.6666667 *0.9887:

0.6666667 * 0.9887 = (0.6666667)*(0.9887) = 

Let me compute 0.6666667 * 0.9887:

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.660 (since 0.6666667 *1=0.6666667, so 0.9887 is about 98.87% of that, so 0.6666667 *0.9887 ≈ 0.660).

So gamma*beta ≈6.5922.

So L = gamma*beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute 6.5922 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

First, multiply 6.5922 *3e8:

6.5922 *3e8 = 1.97766e9 m/s.

Wait, no, 6.5922 *3e8 = 6.5922 * 3 *1e8 = 19.7766e8 = 1.97766e9.

Wait, no: 6.5922 *3e8 = (6.5922 *3) *1e8 = 19.7766e8 = 1.97766e9 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.97766e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97766 * 2.056875) * 1e9 *1e-24.

1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

Compute 1.97766 *2.056875.

Let me compute this:

1.97766 * 2 = 3.95532.

1.97766 * 0.056875 ≈ let's compute 0.056875 *1.97766.

0.05 *1.97766=0.098883.

0.006875 *1.97766 ≈ approx 0.01366.

So total approx 0.098883 + 0.01366 =0.112543.

So 1.97766 *2.056875 ≈3.95532 +0.112543=4.06786.

So 4.06786e-15 meters.

Hmm, that's about 4.06786e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference may be due to approximations in the beta calculation. Let me check if I can be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Compute gamma squared: (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.44444444.

So 1/gamma² = 1/(44.44444444) ≈0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775).

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99.

Wait, 0.9775 is between 0.97 and 0.98.

Compute using more precise method.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

Approximate:

Let x = 0.9775.

Find sqrt(x).

We know that (0.988)^2 = 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

(0.989)^2 = 0.978121, which is more than 0.9775.

So it's between 0.988 and 0.989.

Find the difference:

0.988^2 = 0.976144.

0.9775 -0.976144 = 0.001356.

The interval between 0.988 and 0.989 is 0.001 in x (since 0.989^2=0.978121, which is 0.978121-0.976144=0.001977 higher).

We need to find how much delta beyond 0.988 gives x=0.9775.

The delta is 0.001356 over 0.001977 per 0.001 of delta in x.

So delta ≈ (0.001356 / 0.001977) * 0.001.

Compute 0.001356 /0.001977 ≈ 0.686.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988 + 0.686 * 0.001 = 0.988686.

So beta≈0.988686.

Now, gamma * beta = 6.666666667 * 0.988686.

Compute this:

6.666666667 * 0.988686.

Let me compute 6 * 0.988686 =5.932116.

0.666666667 *0.988686 ≈0.660.

Wait, compute 0.666666667 * 0.988686:

0.988686 * 2/3 ≈0.659124.

So total is 5.932116 +0.659124 ≈6.59124.

So gamma*beta ≈6.59124.

Now, L = gamma*beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.59124 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.59124 *3=19.77372.

So 19.77372e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (19.77372 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24.

1e8 *1e-24 =1e-16.

Compute 19.77372 *2.056875.

Let me compute this:

19.77372 *2 =39.54744.

19.77372 *0.056875.

Compute 19.77372 *0.05=0.988686.

19.77372 *0.006875 = approx 19.77372 * (1/145) ≈0.1364.

So 0.988686 +0.1364≈1.125086.

So the total is 39.54744 +1.125086 ≈40.672526.

So 40.672526e-16 meters.

Which is 4.0672526e-15 meters.

That's approximately 4.067e-15 m. So the closest option is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substitute \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5912.
\]

Then, calculate \( \gamma \beta c \tau \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
L = (6.5912 \times 3) \times (10^8 \times 10^{-24}) \times 2.056875.
\]

\[
L = 19.7736 \times 10^{-16} \times 2.056875 \approx 4.06725 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.06725 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**. The slight discrepancy is due to approximations in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
