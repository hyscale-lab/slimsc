Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The setup is given, and I need to choose the correct statement among the options A to D.

So, from what I remember, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components are related to spin matrices. For a muon, which is a lepton, I think the spin is 1/2, so the matrices would be 2x2 Pauli matrices scaled appropriately.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c = h/(4π). And the matrix S is provided as:

First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0.

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, or something like that. Let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]... wait, yes, that's exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

But wait, wait. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So S here is σy.

So, Ay = c * σy. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

Hmm. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σy are ±i, I think. Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1 when multiplied by something. Wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, actually, the trace is zero, determinant is -1, so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1? Oh wait, no, wait. For σy, the eigenvalues would be plus and minus 1 because the trace is zero and the determinant is -1 (since 0*0 - (-i)(i)= 0 - (-i^2) = 1, so the determinant is (0)(0)-(-i)(i)= -(i^2) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so -(-1)=1. So the eigenvalues satisfy λ² = determinant, which is 1. So λ is ±1.

Wait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if S is σy, then the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c*S, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. So a = c * (±1) = ±c.

So c is h/(4π). So a would be ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2π h, which seems way too big. Option B's eigenvalues are 1/2 and -1/2; that doesn't match because our calculation gives real numbers, but maybe that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, S is σy, which is a Hermitian matrix. So its eigenvalues are real. So when multiplied by c, which is a real number, the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be ±c, which are real numbers. But looking at the options, options A and B have eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense if Ay is Hermitian.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me think. S is σy, which is Hermitian (since σy is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian). So if c is a real scalar, then Ay = c * S would be Hermitian. So the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real. So all the eigenvalues of Ay should be real, not complex.

But wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So that can't be right because Ay is Hermitian, eigenvalues should be real.

Option B: eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts? Wait, no. Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, and real parts are ±1. Wait, that's confusing. The eigenvalues are a complex number? That can't be, because Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the setup. Oh wait, wait, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That is the σy matrix. So S is Hermitian because σy is Hermitian. Then, c is a real number, so Ay is Hermitian. So eigenvalues should be real.

Wait a second, but another thought: sometimes angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in terms of ħ. Wait, but in this problem, c is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/2 because ħ is h/(2π). So c= ħ/(2π) * 2. Wait, wait, let's compute c:

c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? No, wait: h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h is 2π ħ. So c = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2).

So c is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±c = ±ħ/2.

Wait, wait, but ħ/2 is a real number. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be real, so any option that suggests eigenvalues having imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh. That can't be, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: eigenvalues have real parts ±1, imaginary parts ±½. So complex numbers. That's wrong because eigenvalues are real.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, but what do I know about eigenfunctions and operators?

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A is a component of angular momentum, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with each component in the case of spin-½ particles. So for spin systems, A² is s(s+1)ħ², where s=1/2. So A² is a scalar operator, and its eigenfunctions are the same as those of any component.

Wait, but in this case, the operator Ay has eigenfunctions φ. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So statement C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which would be correct. But it also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Hmm. Wait, but for spin-½ particles, any eigenstate of one component is not an eigenstate of another component. So for example, if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az. So statement C would be correct.

But wait, what about option D? It says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I think the basis functions are the eigenvectors, so perhaps that's correct. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the matrix operator's basis functions could be the standard basis vectors, but in this case, the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors. So D could be correct. Wait, but I'm not recalling exactly the meaning of that statement.

Now, let's think back to the eigenvalue question. The eigenvalues of Ay are ±ħ/2. Let me compute that in terms of h.

Since ħ = h/(2π), then ħ/2 = h/(4π), which is exactly c. So the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

So looking at the options, none of the options A or B describe real eigenvalues. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: "The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π." That suggests complex eigenvalues, which can't be right because Ay is Hermitian.

Option B: "The imaginary parts are ±½, real parts ±1." Also complex eigenvalues, which is impossible.

So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, options C and D: which one is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is a scalar, its eigenvalue is the same for any state, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So part of option C is correct. The second part is that they're not eigenfunctions of Az. Since the components of angular momentum don't commute, a state that's an eigenstate of Ay won't be an eigenstate of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, the 'basis functions' here are probably the eigenvectors of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator's action. I'm not entirely sure, but it seems plausible. Alternatively, the statement might be suggesting that the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix representation, which is true for any diagonalizable matrix. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the correct statement is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², and not of Az. So option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about option D. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of those eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors are basis functions for Ay, so D's statement is correct. Hmm.

Wait, but the question states that the operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenvectors will form a basis for the space, so yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again.

The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So, let's check each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is a scalar operator, its eigenvalue is same for all states, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So first part of C is correct. But for the Az part, since [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so they can serve as the basis functions for the operator.

So both C and D seem correct. But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space in which the operator acts, especially if the operator is diagonalizable. So D's statement is correct.

But then, another thought: the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me re-examine the eigenvalues.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is Ay = c * S, where S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So Ay's eigenvalues are c * (±1) = ±c. So since c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues should be ±h/(4π), which are real numbers.

So looking back, none of the options A and B are correct because their eigenvalues are complex.

So the correct statement must be either C or D.

Now, considering option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² is a scalar multiple (since A² = (ħ²)(s(s+1)) ), so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (exact commutation relation?), so yes, they don't commute. So a state eigenfunction of Ay won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

What about option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is represented as a matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Are the eigenfunctions the same as the basis functions? The basis functions are the basis vectors, which can be any set of vectors, not necessarily eigenvectors. But in this case, the eigenvectors are a basis. So statement D is correct.

But the problem is, I'm getting two options (C and D) that seem correct, but that can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's reevaluate each option carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² is a scalar, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The matrix operator is represented in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the space. So yes, D is correct. Because the matrix representation of Ay is in the standard basis, but if the eigenfunctions are in another basis, perhaps not. Wait, no. The matrix is given, and the eigenvectors are in the same space as the matrix. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for that operator.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the statements again.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix operator's representation is in a particular basis. The eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis in which the operator is represented. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

But then, why is the option C correct as well?

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. The basis functions refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. If the operator is represented in the eigenbasis, then the basis functions are the eigenvectors. But if the operator is represented in a different basis, then the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) may not be the same as the basis functions.

In this problem, the matrix S (and thus Ay) is given in a certain basis. The eigenvectors of Ay are determined in that same basis. So if the matrix is diagonal in that basis, then the basis functions are the eigenvectors. But if not, then the eigenvectors form a different basis.

Wait, in this case, the matrix Ay is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues. So the eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis for the space, which is the same as the basis in which the matrix is represented. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

So, which of the options is correct? The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

If both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option D. Because the basis functions of the operator would be the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which are the eigenvectors. But if the operator isn't diagonal in that basis, then the statement D may not hold.

Alternatively, the statement D might be correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the operator are the basis in which the operator is represented. The eigenfunctions are the vectors that make the operator diagonal, but if the operator isn't diagonal in that basis, then the statement D is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think again.

The problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions are shared, but Az doesn't commute, so eigenfunctions don't overlap.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions are the basis vectors in which the matrix is written. The eigenfunctions are a different basis if the matrix isn't diagonal. So in this case, if the matrix isn't diagonal in the given basis, then the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions. Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions when the matrix is diagonal. So if the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But in the given problem, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is not diagonal. So the matrix is in a different basis, not the eigenbasis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis, and thus, statement D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The matrix operator is given in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions are in that same basis as vectors. So the eigenfunctions can be expressed as basis vectors in that space. But it's not the same as the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So in the given basis, the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis vectors. So, statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. But the matrix is given in a certain basis, and the eigenfunctions are in that same basis. So the eigenfunctions are functions in that basis, but they are not necessarily the basis vectors. So statement D is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have a matrix in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are vectors in that basis, but they form a different basis (eigenbasis) for the space. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis vectors. So in that case, the statement D would be incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions (standard basis) of the operator.

In our problem, the operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix. The basis functions for the matrix operator would be the standard basis vectors, say |0> and |1>. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as these unless the matrix is diagonal.

So in our case, the matrix is not diagonal; it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis vectors. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.

So, the correct statement is option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, after all this thinking, the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian. Its eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

2. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because \( A_y \) is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real.
   - **Option B:** Claims that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because \( A_y \) has real eigenvalues, not complex ones.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a scalar operator that commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the basis functions in which \( A_y \) is represented. The eigenfunctions form a different basis (the eigenbasis of \( A_y \)), not the basis in which \( A_y \) is given.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
