Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Adding NaCN—sodium cyanide. What reaction happens when a ketone reacts with HCN or its sodium salt?

Oh, I remember that ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles. So, NaCN would provide the CN- ion. In the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe? Because in the formation of cyanohydrins, the ketone reacts with HCN (or a cyanide salt) in acidic conditions.

Wait, butan-2-one (acetone) reacting with NaCN and some acid (A) gives a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding cyanide would add across the carbonyl group. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group on the same carbon, which is the same as the original carbonyl carbon. So the product structure makes sense.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the reagents are typically HCN and an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+. Alternatively, using NaCN as the cyanide source (so CN- in solution) and an acid catalyst would work. So in this case, A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile group. And the product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents.

Wait a second, how do nitriles convert to carboxylic acids? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The typical reactions are:

1. Hydrolysis with strong acid (like H2SO4) and water, possibly with heat, gives a carboxylic acid. I think this is under acidic conditions.
2. Another method is using a strong base like NaOH, which would give a carboxylate salt, which is then acidified to give the carboxylic acid.

But wait, in this case, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is R-C(OH)-CN. Wait, no, it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CN? Wait no, wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile.

But let me think about the reaction. So the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is at the end of a chain, and when hydrolyzed, it becomes a COOH group.

But in this case, the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the structure is something like R-C(OH)(CN)-... Hmm, but wait, let me think about the actual structure.

Wait, 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would be HOCH2CH2CH2CN. No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butane is four carbons. So 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would be CH2OHCH2CH2CN? Or maybe CH3CH(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the fourth carbon: CH2CH2CH2CN? That doesn't seem right. Wait, butanenitrile is actually CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH2, but butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN as CH2CH2CH2CN? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of butanenitrile as CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, butane has four carbons, so butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but that would only be three carbons. Hmm, maybe I should think it's more accurately as CH3CH2CH2CN. So, the nitrile is on the third carbon of butane. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but
