Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. So, when the operator P acts on this eigenvector, it just scales it by ħ/2.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, right. So the total operator P along the direction n is a combination of these components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented as a point on the x-z plane, so any direction can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, perhaps. But wait, the direction is arbitrary, but the eigenvectors depend on that direction. Hmm.

I think the general form of the operator P along a direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the respective direction cosine. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since our direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So for any direction, we can choose to parameterize it by an angle θ, say, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because, imagine the x-z plane: if θ is 0, the direction is along +z; as θ increases to π/2, it moves towards +x. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, P = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. Because n_y is zero.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the components of P are P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator along direction n is given by the dot product of n with the vector operator P. So P = n · P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So substituting the values of P_x, P_z:

P = (n_x) * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

- The (1,1) element is n_z*(1) + 0*... from P_x? Wait, wait, let's see. Wait, the P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by n_x, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are n_x. The P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by n_z, so the (1,1) is n_z and (2,2) is -n_z.

So combining, the matrix for P is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix for P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, the problem says we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me denote this eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

So the equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0.

Substituting P and λ, let's compute P - λ I.

P - λ I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I

I is the identity matrix, so I = [[1,0],[0,1]]. So subtracting, each element becomes:

(ħ/2) [n_z - 1, n_x; n_x, -n_z -1 ]

Wait, wait no. Let me write it correctly. Each element:

(P - λ I) is (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[ n_z - 1, n_x ]
[ n_x, -n_z - 1 ]

Wait, because the diagonal elements are (n_z * ħ/2) - (λ * 1) = (n_z ħ/2) - (ħ/2 * 1) ), because λ is (ħ/2). So that would be (n_z - 1) * ħ/2.

Similarly, the off-diagonal elements are (n_x * ħ/2) - 0, because the identity matrix has zero off-diagonal. So yeah, the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, but wait a minute, no. Let me correct that. Because λ is the eigenvalue, so the matrix for (P - λ I) is (P matrix) minus λ times the identity matrix. So for each element (i,j):

If i == j, it's (matrix element) - λ, else it's (matrix element).

Wait, more accurately, for matrix P, each element is multiplied by (ħ/2). So for the diagonal elements, n_z and -n_z, each multiplied by ħ/2. For the identity matrix, each diagonal element is 1, so when we subtract λ I, which is (ħ/2) I, because λ is (ħ/2). Wait, no, no: the identity matrix has elements 1 in diagonal and 0 elsewhere. So when we compute (P - λ I), the matrix is:

Each element (i,j) is (P's element at (i,j)) minus (λ * δ_ij), where δ_ij is 1 if i=j, 0 otherwise.

So, for the (1,1) element: (n_z * ħ/2) - (λ * 1) = (n_z * ħ/2) - ( (ħ/2)*1 ). So (n_z - 1) * ħ/2.

Similarly, (2,2) element: (-n_z * ħ/2 ) - ( (ħ/2) *1 ) => (-n_z -1) * ħ/2.

The off-diagonal (1,2) and (2,1) are n_x * ħ/2 - 0, so same as before.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z - 1] ]

But wait, I'm not sure about the minus signs in the (2,2) element. Let me recompute the (2,2) element again. The original P matrix has (2,2) as -n_z * (ħ/2). Then, subtracting λ I, which has (2,2) as λ. So:

(2,2) element of (P - λ I) = (-n_z * ħ/2) - (λ) = (-n_z * ħ/2) - ( ħ/2 )

Factor ħ/2: [ (-n_z) -1 ] * (ħ/2 )

So yes, the matrix is correct as written.

So, the equation (P - λ I) v = 0 implies that the matrix multiplied by the vector v is zero.

The vector v has components (a, b), and we're to find a and b such that:

[ (n_z -1)(a) + n_x (b) ] * (ħ/2) = 0

[ n_x a + (-n_z -1) b ] * (ħ/2) = 0

Since ħ/2 is a scalar factor, we can ignore it (as it's non-zero) and write the equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So now, we have two equations:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation 2: n_x a + ( -n_z -1 ) b = 0

We can write this as a system:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x      ] [a]   = [0]
[ n_x       (-n_z -1) ] [b]     [0]

To find non-zero solutions, the determinant of the matrix must be zero.

Determinant D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2

= [ (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) ) ] - n_x^2

Let me compute (n_z -1)(-n_z -1):

= (-n_z^2 - n_z + n_z +1 )

= (-n_z^2 + 0 n_z +1 )

= 1 - n_z^2

So determinant D = (1 - n_z^2) - n_x^2

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So 1 - n_z^2 = n_x^2.

So D = n_x^2 - n_x^2 = 0.

Which makes sense; since we have an eigenvalue, the determinant should be zero, so the system is consistent and has non-trivial solutions.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can take one equation and express a in terms of b, for example.

Take equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

We can write a = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] b

But wait, wait. Let me rearrange equation 1:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b

So a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

= [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b

Assuming n_z != 1, which is true except when the direction is along +z. Wait, but in that case, when n_z =1, n_x=0, and the problem would be different. But here, n is in x-z plane, so perhaps n_z can be 1 when n is along +z.

Hmm, but in that case, for n_z=1, n_x=0, the matrix for P would be (ħ/2) [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] which is P_z.

The eigenvectors for P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be the spin-up state along z, which is (1, 0), right? Because P_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z> .

But in our case, we're looking for the general case, so let's proceed with the assumption that n_z !=1, so that a is proportional to b.

So, a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b

Let me write the vector v as (a, b) = b * (n_x/(1-n_z), 1 )

Alternatively, we can write the components as a = k * n_x, and b = k * (1 - n_z), but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps, since a = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b, we can write the vector as (n_x, 1 - n_z) multiplied by a normalization factor k. Because then a = n_x * k, b = (1 -n_z) * k.

Wait, but let me check with equation 2.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Substituting a = [ n_x/(1 - n_z) ] b:

n_x * [n_x/(1 - n_z) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

[ n_x²/(1 -n_z) + (-n_z -1) ] b =0

Since b is not zero (non-trivial solution), the coefficient must be zero.

So:

n_x²/(1 -n_z) + (-n_z -1) =0

Multiply both sides by (1 -n_z):

n_x² + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) = 0

Let me expand (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)

= (-n_z) + n_z^2 -1 + n_z

= n_z^2 -1

So:

n_x² + (n_z^2 -1) =0

But since n_x² +n_z^2 =1, substituting:

(1 - n_z^2) + (n_z^2 -1) ) = 0

Which is 0. So yes, the condition is satisfied. So our substitution is correct.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as proportional to (n_x, 1 -n_z )

But wait, since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, because θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the components become:

a = sinθ

b = 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

Wait, because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin² (θ/2 )

So the components are ( sinθ, 2 sin²(θ/2) )

But let's write this as:

v = ( sinθ, 2 sin²(θ/2) )

But wait, let's check the magnitude to normalize.

The magnitude squared is |v|^2 = (sinθ)^2 + (2 sin²(θ/2))^2.

Let me compute that.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So (sinθ)^2 = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)

The second term: [2 sin²(θ/2)]^2 =4 sin^4(θ/2 )

So |v|^2 =4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) + 4 sin^4(θ/2 )

Factor out 4 sin^2(theta/2):

=4 sin^2(theta/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ]

=4 sin^2(theta/2) [1]

So |v|^2=4 sin^2(theta/2)

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(4 sin²(theta/2 )) ) = 1/(2 |sin(theta/2)| )

Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive, since theta is between 0 and pi (as it's a polar angle in x-z plane), so sin(theta/2) is positive for theta between 0 and 2pi, but in our case, theta is from 0 to pi, so theta/2 is from 0 to pi/2, so sin(theta/2) is positive.

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( sin theta / (2 sin(theta/2)), (2 sin^2(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2)) )

Simplify each component:

For the first component: sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / (2 sin(theta/2) ) ) = cos(theta/2 )

Second component: 2 sin^2(theta/2) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, that's neat. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). That makes sense because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates along any direction can be written in terms of the angles theta and phi, but in this case phi is zero because the direction is in x-z plane, so phi=0.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait, let me think: the parameterization for spin in direction (theta, phi) is usually |+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

In our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi}=1.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) 

Option D) (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but the eigenvectors are in terms of the components, but the given options include hbar, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. Wait, no, wait. The eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are vectors in a Hilbert space, which can be multiplied by constants, but their elements are usually dimensionless, considering that ħ is a constant with units of J·s. So perhaps the options have some scaling factors.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived.

But let's look at all options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Hmm, that's a vector, but it's independent of theta and phi, so probably not the correct one.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

That's the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0, but I don't think that's the case here. Because our eigenvector for spin-1/2 should have theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Yes, matches.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, includes factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). Where would those come from? Let me think: perhaps when the direction is along a different axis, but no, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. Wait, maybe the eigenvector depends on the choice of basis. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in normalization.

Wait, let me recheck the normalization. Earlier, I had the vector as (sin theta, 2 sin^2(theta/2) ), which upon normalization gave (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ). So that seems correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the eigenvectors are given in a different basis or there's a factor of sqrt(2) somewhere.

Alternatively, another way to approach the problem is to realize that P is the spin operator in the direction n, and for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>, and |-n> = sin(theta/2)|+z> - e^{i phi} cos(theta/2)|-z>.

In our case, phi=0 because the direction is in x-z plane, so phi=0. Thus, |+n> is cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>.

Which translates to the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), matching option C.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D has a sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by ħ, but no, because in our derivation, the eigenvector is dimensionless, so I don't think ħ is a factor here. The options might be incorrect in that sense.

Wait, the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector", so the correct option would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, where:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $(P - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. Substituting $\lambda$ and solving the system of equations, the eigenvector is found to be proportional to $(\sin\theta, 1 - \cos\theta)$. Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:

\[
(\sin\theta, 1 - \cos\theta) = (2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2), 2\sin^2(\theta/2)).
\]

Normalizing this vector by dividing by its magnitude, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\left( \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) \right).
\]

This result matches the standard parameterization of spin-1/2 eigenstates along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, where $\phi = 0$ (since the direction lies in the x-z plane). 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This is independent of $\theta$ and $\phi$, so it is incorrect.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This corresponds to spherical harmonics for $l=1$, but it does not match the spin-1/2 eigenstate parameterization.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces unnecessary scaling factors and includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
