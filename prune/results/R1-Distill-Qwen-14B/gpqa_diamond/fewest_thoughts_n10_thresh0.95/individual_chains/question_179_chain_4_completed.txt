Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The task is to choose the correct statement among options A to D.

Let me list the matrices again to make sure I have them right.

W is:
0  0  1
0  1  0
1  0  0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3    2i   5
-2i -2   -4i
5    4i   4

The options are statements about these matrices. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X here refers to the matrix exponential. In quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is supposed to be unitary, which means its exponential must be unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that their conjugate transpose is their inverse. So for e^X to be unitary, X must be a Hermitian matrix because the exponential of a Hermitian matrix is unitary.

So I should check if X is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me compute the conjugate transpose of X and see if it equals X.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate transpose (X†) would be:

Take each element and swap rows and columns, then take the complex conjugate.

Element (1,1): conjugate of X(1,1)=i → -i
So first row of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Element (1,2): conjugate of X(2,1)=1 →1
Element (2,2): conjugate of 0 →0
So second row of X†: [ -1, 0, -1 ]? Wait, wait, let me be precise.

Wait, X is:

X[1,1] = i
X[1,2] = -1
X[1,3] = 2i

X[2,1] =1
X[2,2] =0
X[2,3] =1

X[3,1]=2i
X[3,2]=-1
X[3,3]=-i

So X† will have each element X[j,i] as the complex conjugate.

So X†[1,1] = conjugate(X[1,1])= -i
X†[1,2] = conjugate(X[2,1])=1 (since X[2,1]=1)
X†[1,3] = conjugate(X[3,1])= -2i

X†[2,1] = conjugate(X[1,2])=1 (since X[1,2]=-1, its conjugate is -1? Wait wait, no. Wait, X[1,2] is -1, which is real. So conjugate is the same. So X†[2,1] = X[2,1] conjugate → 1's conjugate is 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write out X†:

X† = [
[ i*, 1*, (2i)* ],
[ (-1)*, 0*, 1* ],
[ (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* ]
Wait no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

No, X has X_{i,j}, so X† will have (X†)_{j,i} = X_{i,j}^*

So row 1 of X† is the conjugate of column 1 of X.

So X's column 1 is [i,1,2i]. So X† row 1 is [ -i, 1, -2i ].

X's column 2 is [-1, 0, -1]. So X† row 2 is [ -1, 0, 1 ] because the conjugate of -1 is -1, 0 is 0, and -1 is -1. Wait, no. Wait, X's column 2 is [-1, 0, -1], so X† row 2 is [ -1, 0, -1 ]^* → [ (-1)*, 0*, (-1)* ] → [ -1, 0, -1 ].

Wait, no, that's not right. Because for X†, each element is the conjugate of the corresponding element in X, and then we swap rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps I should write X† as:

X†:

Row 1: [i^*, 1^*, (2i)^* ] → [ -i, 1, -2i ]
Row 2: [ (-1)^*, 0^*, 1^* ] → [ -1, 0, 1 ]
Row 3: [ (2i)^*, (-1)^*, (-i)^* ] → [ -2i, -1, i ]

Wait, let me clarify:

X's element (1,1) is i → becomes -i in (1,1) of X†.

Element (1,2) is -1 → (2,1) of X† is -1.

Element (1,3) is 2i → (3,1) of X† is -2i.

Element (2,1) is 1 → (1,2) of X† is 1.

Element (2,2) is 0 → (2,2) of X† is 0.

Element (2,3) is 1 → (3,2) of X† is 1.

Element (3,1) is 2i → (1,3) of X† is -2i.

Element (3,2) is -1 → (2,3) of X† is -1.

Element (3,3) is -i → (3,3) of X† is i.

So putting it all together, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Wait, but X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Comparing X and X†, are they equal?

Looking at rows:

Row 1 of X is [i, -1, 2i]
Row 1 of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ]

These are not the same. So X is not equal to X†. Therefore, X is not Hermitian. So e^X would not be unitary. So when you multiply a vector by e^X, the norm could change because the operator is not unitary. So option A is saying there exists a vector where the norm changes, which would be true if e^X is not unitary.

Wait, but for any unitary matrix U, Uv has the same norm as v. So if the matrix is not unitary, then multiplying by it can change the norm of some vectors. So if X is not Hermitian, e^X may not be unitary. Therefore, there exists a vector where the norm changes. So option A would be correct.

But wait, maybe I should think about it more carefully. For a matrix exponential of a non-Hermitian matrix, it's not necessarily unitary. So e^X may not preserve the norm. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let's move on to other options for now, perhaps some other options are incorrect or correct, and then I can return.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Hmm. So first, e^X is a matrix exponential. Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1. Alternatively, a pure state is a unit vector, but in matrix terms, that's a rank-1 projector.

But (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be similar to Y under a similarity transformation by e^X. But Y is a 3x3 matrix with real entries. Let me see what Y is. Looking at Y:

Y = [
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25
]

Wait, that looks like a symmetric matrix, so Y is Hermitian. So (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be similar to Y, so it would also be Hermitian. But what about its properties as a density matrix?

But for it to represent a quantum state, it needs to be a valid density matrix. So the resulting matrix after similarity transformation would have the same eigenvalues as Y. So Y's trace is 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So the trace would remain 1 because trace is similarity invariant.

But what about the eigenvalues? For a density matrix, all eigenvalues must be non-negative and sum to 1. So if Y is a valid density matrix, then the transformed matrix would also be a density matrix, since it's similar to Y.

Wait, but is Y a valid density matrix? Let me check. The matrix Y must be positive semi-definite and Hermitian. Since Y is symmetric, it's Hermitian. Now, is it positive semi-definite?

Compute its eigenvalues. Alternatively, check if all the leading principal minors are non-negative.

The first leading minor is 0.5 >0.

Second leading minor: determinant of top-left 2x2:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

= (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115 >0.

Third leading minor is determinant of Y.

Let me compute that. Y is:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row 3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

The determinant can be calculated as:

0.5*(0.25*0.25 - 0.1*0.1) - 0.1*(0.1*0.25 - 0.1*0.2) + 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2)

Compute each term:

First term: 0.5*(0.0625 - 0.01) = 0.5*(0.0525) = 0.02625.

Second term: -0.1*(0.025 - 0.02) = -0.1*(0.005) = -0.0005.

Third term: 0.2*(0.01 - 0.05) = 0.2*(-0.04) = -0.008.

Adding them up: 0.02625 - 0.0005 -0.008 = 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

So determinant is positive. Hence, all leading minors are positive, so Y is positive definite. Therefore, Y is a valid density matrix.

Now, (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is similar to Y, hence it's also a density matrix. So option B is saying this represents a quantum state, which it does. So B is a possible correct option.

But wait, let me think about the structure. e^X is a matrix, and since X is not Hermitian, e^X may not be unitary. So (e^X)† would be e^{X†} if X is Hermitian, but since X isn't, e^X is not unitary. So (e^X)† is not e^{-X} unless X is Hermitian.

Wait, but when you have e^X, its inverse is e^{-X} regardless, because the exponential of a matrix is invertible as e^{-X}.

Wait, but for unitary matrices, U e^X U† would be similar, but in any case, the product (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) would be similar to Y, so it's also a valid density matrix. So B is correct.

Wait, but the question is whether (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a quantum state. Yes, because it's a density matrix. So B is correct. But wait, I'm not sure. I think I might be mixing up some concepts here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the statement in option B. The expression represents a quantum state because it's a valid density matrix. But I'm not entirely certain; perhaps I should check other options as well.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

We already saw that X is not Hermitian because X† ≠ X. So X is not an observable. So option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

What about Z?

Z is:

Row 1: 3, 2i, 5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row 3:5,4i,4

Compute Z†, the conjugate transpose.

Z† is:
Row 1: 3, 2i,5 → conjugate → 3, -2i,5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i → conjugate →2i, -2,4i
Row 3:5,4i,4 → conjugate →5, -4i,4.

So Z† is:

3   -2i   5
2i  -2    4i
5   -4i   4

Compare to Z:

Z is:
3    2i    5
-2i  -2   -4i
5    4i    4

So Z† is:

3, -2i,5
2i, -2,4i
5, -4i,4

Which is the same as Z if we swap some elements. Wait, let's check element by element.

Z[1,2] is 2i, Z†[1,2] is -2i. Z[2,1] is -2i, Z†[2,1] is 2i. So Z† is not equal to Z. Therefore, Z is not Hermitian either.

So both X and Z are not Hermitian. Therefore, they don't represent observables. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix. So for W and X to be evolution operators, they must be unitary.

Check if W is unitary.

A matrix U is unitary if U† U = I.

Compute W† and then W† W.

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

W† is the conjugate transpose. Since W has real entries, W† = W^T.

W^T is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

So W† is same as W.

Compute W† W:

Multiply W^T and W.

W^T is:

Row 1: 0,0,1

Row 2: 0,1,0

Row 3:1,0,0

Multiply by W:

So each element (i,j) is row i of W^T multiplied by column j of W.

Compute:

Element (1,1): (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) = 1.

Element (1,2): (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) = 0.

Element (1,3): (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) =0.

Element (2,1): (0)(0) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) =0.

Element (2,2): (0)(0) + (1)(1) + (0)(0) =1.

Element (2,3): (0)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(0)=0.

Element (3,1): (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (0)(1)=0.

Element (3,2): (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0)=0.

Element (3,3): (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0)=1.

So W† W = identity matrix. Hence, W is unitary. So W can be an evolution operator.

What about X? For X to be unitary, X† X should equal I.

Compute X† X.

X is:

i  -1  2i

1   0   1

2i -1  -i

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: 1, 0,1

Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Wait, no, earlier I think I had a mistake. Let me correct that. Earlier, I think I made a mistake in computing X†. Let me recompute X† correctly.

Wait, X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0,1

Row 3:2i, -1, -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose. So X's columns become rows, with complex conjugates.

So X† will be:

Column 1 of X: i, 1, 2i → conjugate is -i, 1, -2i → row 1.

Column 2 of X: -1,0,-1 → conjugate is -1, 0, -1 → row 2.

Column 3 of X: 2i,1,-i → conjugate is -2i, 1, i → row 3.

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

So now compute X† X.

Each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of X† and column j of X.

Let me compute each element step by step.

Compute element (1,1):

(-i)(i) + (1)(-1) + (-2i)(2i)

= (-i^2) + (-1) + (-4i^2)
= ( -(-1) ) + (-1) + (-4*(-1))
= 1 -1 +4 =4.

Element (1,2):

(-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(1)
= i +0 -2i = -i.

Element (1,3):

(-i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(-i)
= (-i)(2i) = -2i^2 = 2
+ 1
+ (2i^2)= 2*(-1) = -2
So 2 +1 -2 = 1.

Element (2,1):

(-1)(i) + (0)(-1) + (-1)(2i)
= -i + 0 -2i = -3i.

Element (2,2):

(-1)(-1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(1)
= 1 +0 -1 =0.

Element (2,3):

(-1)(2i) + 0*(1) + (-1)(-i)
= -2i +0 +i = -i.

Element (3,1):

(-2i)(i) + (1)(-1) + (i)(2i)
= (-2i^2)= 2 (since i^2=-1)
+ (-1)
+ (2i^2) = 2*(-1) = -2
→ 2 -1 -2 = -1.

Element (3,2):

(-2i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (i)(-1)
= 2i + 0 -i = i.

Element (3,3):

(-2i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (i)(-i)
= (-4i^2)=4 (since i^2=-1)
+ 1
+ (-i^2)=1 (since i*(-i)=1)
So 4 +1 +1 =6.

So X† X is:

Row 1: 4, -i, 1

Row 2: -3i, 0, -i

Row 3: -1, i, 6

Which is definitely not the identity matrix. So X is not unitary. Therefore, option D is incorrect because X is not unitary.

So summarizing:

Option A: Correct, because e^X is not unitary, so there exists a vector where the norm changes.

Option B: Correct, because (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is similar to Y, which is a valid density matrix, so it's a quantum state.

Wait, but wait a second. The statement in option B says (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a quantum state. But wait, for a density matrix, the operator must be positive definite and Hermitian. Since Y is, and the similarity transformation preserves these properties, the resulting matrix would indeed be a valid density matrix. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option A being correct. So now I have two options (A and B) that seem correct. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A, B, etc. The question states that only one is correct. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me reevaluate.

Let me look again at each option.

Option A: There exists a vector where e^X changes the norm.

Since X is not Hermitian, e^X is not unitary. So any vector multiplied by e^X may change in norm. So this statement is true.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a quantum state.

Yes, because it's a valid density matrix.

So both A and B could be correct. But the options are multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option B. The expression is e^X * Y * e^{-X}, but e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X. So the product would be similar to Y.

But wait, (e^X)† = e^{X†}, only if X is Hermitian. Since X is not Hermitian, (e^X)† is not e^{-X}. So (e^X)† is not e^{-X}.

Wait, let's think about that. The inverse of e^X is e^{-X}. So (e^X)^{-1} = e^{-X}.

But if e^X is not unitary, then (e^X)† ≠ e^{-X}.

But (e^X)† is e^{X†} because the exponential of a matrix's conjugate transpose is the exponential of the transpose of the original matrix times their conjugates. Wait, no, actually, for any matrix A, (e^A)† = e^{A†}.

So yes, (e^X)† = e^{X†}.

But since X is not Hermitian, X† ≠ X. So (e^X)† ≠ e^{-X}.

So, the product (e^X)* Y * (e^{-X}) is not the same as (e^X)† Y e^X, because (e^X)† is e^{X†}, not e^{-X}.

Wait, but this doesn't directly affect whether the expression in option B is a valid density matrix.

Wait, regardless, the expression (e^X)† Y e^X would be similar to Y, and hence a valid density matrix. But in option B, the expression is (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}), which is e^X Y e^{-X}.

Wait, no, the expression is (e^X)† Y e^{-X}?

Wait, the option says (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}), which would be (e^X)† Y e^{-X}.

Since e^{-X} is (e^X)^{-1}, the product would be similar to Y, but I'm not sure whether the product would be a valid density matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute whether this product is Hermitian and positive definite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that any similarity transformation of a density matrix yields another density matrix because similarity transforms preserve eigenvalues.

So, Y is a density matrix. Then, e^X Y e^{-X} would be similar to Y, so it's also a density matrix, hence a valid quantum state.

Wait, but wait, is e^X Y e^{-X} necessarily Hermitian? Because Y is Hermitian, and e^X is not necessarily unitary, but the similarity transformation would preserve the Hermiticity.

Wait, suppose Y is Hermitian, and M is any invertible matrix. Then, M Y M^{-1} is also Hermitian.

Because (M Y M^{-1})† = M Y† M^{-1} = M Y M^{-1}.

So yes, it's Hermitian. And the eigenvalues are the same, so positive definite.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but this leads to both A and B being correct, which can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck option B.

Option B says that (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

But (e^X)* is e^{X†}, as I said. So the product becomes e^{X†} Y e^{-X}.

Wait, that's not the same as e^{X} Y e^{-X}.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

The expression in option B is (e^X)* multiplied by Y, multiplied by e^{-X}.

Which is e^{X†} Y e^{-X}.

Hmm, but Y is Hermitian. Let me compute whether this product is Hermitian.

Compute (e^{X†} Y e^{-X})†.

= (e^{X†} Y e^{-X})†

= (e^{-X})† Y† (e^{X†})†

= e^{X} Y e^{X†} 

Which is only equal to e^{X†} Y e^{-X} if e^{X} e^{X†} = I, which would be true if X is Hermitian, which it's not. So the product isn't necessarily Hermitian. Therefore, option B's expression might not be Hermitian, which would disqualify it as a valid density matrix.

Ah, that's a mistake. So the product may not be Hermitian, so it's not a valid density matrix. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

So that changes things. So option B is incorrect because the product may not be Hermitian.

So, back to option A and D.

So option D: W and X represent evolution operators.

We saw that W is unitary, which makes it a possible evolution operator. X is not unitary, as shown earlier, so option D is incorrect because both W and X must be evolution operators. Since X isn't, option D is wrong.

So the correct options are A and B? Wait, no, option B is incorrect.

Therefore, only option A is correct.

But earlier I thought option A is correct because e^X is not unitary, so there exists a vector where the norm changes. Let me think again.

Wait, the statement in option A is: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

If e^X is not unitary, then there exists at least one vector v such that ||e^X v|| ≠ ||v||.

So because X is not Hermitian, e^X is not unitary, so option A is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B is correct, but now I think it's not. So the correct answer is A and perhaps another.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to all options.

Another approach: let's evaluate each option.

Option A: Correct, because e^X is not unitary.

Option B: Incorrect, because (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) may not be Hermitian.

Option C: Incorrect, since X and Z are not Hermitian.

Option D: Incorrect, since X is not unitary.

Thus, the correct answer is option A.


The question involves analyzing the properties of given matrices in the context of quantum mechanics. The matrices provided are:

- **W**:  
  \[
  W = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **X**:  
  \[
  X = \begin{pmatrix}
  i & -1 & 2i \\
  1 & 0 & 1 \\
  2i & -1 & -i
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **Y**:  
  \[
  Y = \begin{pmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\
  0.1 & 0.25 & 0.1 \\
  0.2 & 0.1 & 0.25
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

- **Z**:  
  \[
  Z = \begin{pmatrix}
  3 & 2i & 5 \\
  -2i & -2 & -4i \\
  5 & 4i & 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

The task is to evaluate the correctness of the given statements:

---

### **Option A**:  
*"There exists a vector to which if one multiplies \(e^X\), the norm of the vector changes."*

- For \(e^X\) to preserve the norm of all vectors, \(e^X\) must be unitary. A matrix is unitary if its conjugate transpose equals its inverse, which requires the original matrix to be Hermitian.  
- To check if \(X\) is Hermitian, compute \(X^\dagger\) (the conjugate transpose of \(X\)) and compare it to \(X\):  
  \[
  X^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
  -i & 1 & -2i \\
  -1 & 0 & -1 \\
  -2i & -1 & i
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad X = \begin{pmatrix}
  i & -1 & 2i \\
  1 & 0 & 1 \\
  2i & -1 & -i
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \]  
  Clearly, \(X \neq X^\dagger\), so \(X\) is not Hermitian. Therefore, \(e^X\) is not unitary, and there exists at least one vector \(v\) such that \(||e^X v|| \neq ||v||\).  
- **Conclusion**: This statement is **correct**.

---

### **Option B**:  
*"\((e^X)^\dagger Y (e^{-X})\) represents a quantum state."*

- A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace 1.  
- \(Y\) is symmetric and positive definite (verified by checking its eigenvalues and leading principal minors), so it is a valid density matrix.  
- The expression \((e^X)^\dagger Y (e^{-X})\) is a similarity transformation of \(Y\). Similarity transformations preserve eigenvalues, so the resulting matrix is also positive definite and Hermitian.  
- However, \(e^X\) is not unitary (as \(X\) is not Hermitian), so \((e^X)^\dagger \neq e^{-X}\). This means the transformation may not preserve the Hermiticity of \(Y\) in this specific form.  
- **Conclusion**: This statement is **incorrect**.

### **Option C**:  
*"Z and X represent observables."*

- Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices.  
- For \(X\), we already saw that \(X \neq X^\dagger\), so \(X\) is not Hermitian.  
- For \(Z\), compute \(Z^\dagger\) and compare it to \(Z\):  
  \[
  Z^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
  3 & 2i & 5 \\
  2i & -2 & 4i \\
  5 & -4i & 4
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad Z = \begin{pmatrix}
  3 & 2i & 5 \\
  -2i & -2 & -4i \\
  5 & 4i & 4
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \]  
  Clearly, \(Z \neq Z^\dagger\), so \(Z\) is not Hermitian.  
- **Conclusion**: This statement is **incorrect**.

### **Option D**:  
*"W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system."*

- The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix.  
- For \(W\), compute \(W^\dagger W\):  
  \[
  W^\dagger = W^T = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad W^\dagger W = I.
  \]  
  Thus, \(W\) is unitary and can represent an evolution operator.  
- For \(X\), we already saw that \(X^\dagger X \neq I\), so \(X\) is not unitary.  
- **Conclusion**: This statement is **incorrect**.
