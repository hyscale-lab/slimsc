Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. I remember LTE is when the gas is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, so the usual rules of thermodynamics apply, like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for particle energies.

So, the problem is about the excitation of iron atoms in each star. The excitation here refers to the population of a certain energy level. The ratio of populations is given as twice as excited for star_1 compared to star_2. Let me denote this ratio as N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number of excited atoms in star_1 and N2 in star_2.

I recall that the population of a specific energy level in a gas is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is N = N0 * exp(-E/(k*T)), where N0 is the ground state population, E is the energy of the level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but sometimes the ratio is expressed as N_i/N_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since E_i and E_j here are just two different energy levels, and if E is the energy difference between them, then E_i - E_j is E, so the ratio would be N_i/N_j = exp(-E/(k T)).

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, with E1 being higher than E2. The ratio of their populations would be N1/N2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But since E1 > E2, (E1-E2) is positive, so the exponent is negative, leading to N1 being smaller than N2. But in our case, N1 (star_1) is twice N2 (star_2), so N1/N2 = 2. So 2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So maybe the energy level being considered is the same for both stars, so E is the same. So E is the same for both, so the energy difference E is the same.

So for each star, the population of that energy level is:

N1 = N0,1 * exp(-E/(k T1))
N2 = N0,2 * exp(-E/(k T2))

But wait, N0 would be the ground state population, but I'm not sure if it's the same for both stars. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the ratio N1/N2 is 2, and the ground state populations are the same? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of excited to ground state is given.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps N1 (excited) over N2 (excited) is 2. So N1/N2=2.

But since both are in LTE, their respective N's are determined by their temperatures. So:

N1/N2 = exp( -(E)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E)/(k T2) ) )

Because N0 (ground state) could be different for each star, but if we're only considering the ratio of the same excited state relative to their ground states, then N1/N2 would be (N0,1 / N0,2) ) * exp( -(E/(k T1)) ) / exp( -(E/(k T2)) )

But wait, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps the ratio is N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number of atoms in the excited state of star_1, and N2 is the same for star_2.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the populations for the same energy level in each star.

So, the ratio can be written as:

(N1)/(N2) = exp( - (E)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (E)/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So:

exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) )

So here, a is -(E/(k T1)), b is -(E/(k T2)), so a - b = [ -(E/(k T1)) ] - [ -(E/(k T2)) ] = E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

So the ratio N1/N2 is exp( E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But the ratio is given as 2, so:

2 = exp( E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (E/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So substituting that in:

ln(2) = E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but let me check that algebra. Let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )? Let me see.

Yes, because:

1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2)
1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2)
So,

1/T2 -1/T1 = [T1 - T2]/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So going back,

ln(2) = E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the question didn't provide the value of E, but it's given. Oh, but the options don't include E, so perhaps the equation can be rearranged in terms of the temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange the equation to express the ratio of T1 and T2.

Wait, but let me think about the equation again. The equation is:

ln(2) = (E/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But I'm not sure how to get to the options from here. Let's look at the options.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But that would require E/(k) to be 1, which is not the case. So that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternate approach: Assume that the excitation ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio of the populations for two energy states (E and 0, for example) is given by:

N_E / N_0 = exp( -E/(k T) )

So for star_1: N1_E / N1_0 = exp( -E/(k T1) )

For star_2: N2_E / N2_0 = exp( -E/(k T2) )

Assuming that in each star, the ratio N_E / N_0 is what's given. But the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1_E = 2 N2_E.

But without knowing the ground state populations, this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

But the problem states, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps N1_E = 2 N2_E.

But without knowing N1_0 and N2_0, which are the ground state populations, we might have to make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of N_E to the total population is the same, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the ground state populations are considered the same for both stars. Or perhaps the ratio N1_E / N2_E = 2, and that's all we need.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the excitation in terms of the same energy level, so the problem reduces to the ratio of their populations for the same E.

Wait, but from the previous calculation, the result was:

ln(2) = (E/(k)) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But let me think about the given options again. None of the options directly match this form. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, but this would imply that E/k =1. Wait, but E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute E/(k).

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * 1 K. So E/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting E/(k) =1 into the equation:

ln(2) = (1) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which gives:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So looking at the options, option D is exactly this.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations for the excited state to the ground state is given by:

\[
\frac{N_E}{N_0} = \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( N_E \) is the population of the excited state, \( N_0 \) is the population of the ground state, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the populations of the excited state are related by the ratio \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} = 2 \), where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the populations of the excited state in star_1 and star_2, respectively. The ratio of the populations can also be expressed as:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} = 2 \), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the energy difference \( E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \frac{E}{k} = 1 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
