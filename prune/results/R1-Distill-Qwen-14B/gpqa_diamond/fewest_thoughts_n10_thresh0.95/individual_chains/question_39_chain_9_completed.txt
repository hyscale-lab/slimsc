Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. I remember from my studies that the wave function has to satisfy certain conditions, like normalization, because the total probability of finding a particle somewhere must be 1.

The question says that each particle's wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait—no, wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, right? So having an imaginary part makes sense. But for normalization, I think we only consider the square of the modulus, which is the absolute value squared. Because the probability density is the square of the wave function's magnitude.

Wait, but looking at the wave function: (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, that's interesting. So the wave function is a sum of a real term and an imaginary term. 

The problem states that when measuring the position, no particles were found at x<1 or x>3. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. Meaning the wave function is zero outside this region, but in this case, the given wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3 because maybe elsewhere it's not defined. Or perhaps the wave function is zero outside, but the form given is valid in the region between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 +x )) -0.5i. Let me think about the domain. For sqrt(1 +x) to be real, 1+x must be positive. So x >= -1. But the measurements show that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside this interval. But in the given expression, when x is between 1 and 3, sqrt(1+x) is between sqrt(2) and 2. So the real part is a divided by that. So the wave function is non-zero between 1 and 3, but zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the given expression doesn't show zero elsewhere. Wait, but perhaps the wave function is defined only between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside? Or maybe the wave function is a combination of functions that makes it zero outside that region. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but for the purpose of normalization, I think we can proceed by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 and set that equal to 1.

So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you take the modulus squared, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2, right?

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, wait—no, wait a second. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So yes, the integrand is [ (a^2)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral step by step.

First, split it into two parts:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) dx] + Integral from 1 to 3 of [0.25 dx] = 1.

Compute the first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Subtract 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a squared is approximately 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8495.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but did I make any mistakes? Let me check.

Wait, the wave function given is ( a/sqrt(1+x) ) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

Yes, the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Ah, but wait, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

So when you integrate from 1 to 3, the first integral is a² ln(2), because ∫1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), so a² * ln(2).

Second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8495, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The total probability of finding the particle is 1, so we normalize the wave function by integrating \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   This is simply:
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.8495.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), so the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
