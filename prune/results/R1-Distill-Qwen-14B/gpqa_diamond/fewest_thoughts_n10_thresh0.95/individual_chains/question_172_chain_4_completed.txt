Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the photosphere is the part of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star where most of the light is emitted, and it's where the star's spectrum is formed. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation energy—like the energy of the electrons in the atoms? And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Because in thermal equilibrium (LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in different energy states depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where n2 is the number in higher energy, n1 lower. Oh wait, but in this case, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1 than star_2.

Wait, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if star_1 has a higher ratio of excited atoms, perhaps its temperature is higher. Because higher temperatures mean more excitation.

The energy difference ΔE is given, so let's say E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE. So for star_1, the ratio n2/n1 is 2. For star_2, I guess it's 1, or maybe a different ratio? Wait, no, wait. The question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So I think it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state that's double for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me parse the question again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, perhaps the excitation level (like the number of atoms in a certain excited state) is higher in star_1. So for star_1, n2/n1 is twice that of star_2's n2/n1.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that the energy levels' difference is the same (ΔE is the same). So in both stars, the same transition's energy is 1.38e-23 J. But the excitation—so the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state—depends on temperature.

The Boltzmann factor relates the ratio to temperature. So for star_1, let's call their ratio R1 = n2/n1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2. Or wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If star_1 has twice as many atoms in that energy level compared to star_2, then R1 = 2 R2. But the way the question is phrased, "twice as excited in a specific energy level"—maybe that's the ratio. So R1 = 2 R2.

So, for each star, R = n2/(n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So for star_1: R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, no. Because the higher the temperature, the more the atoms are excited, so the higher the ratio R. So perhaps when T increases, R increases. So if star_1 has higher R than star_2, then T1 is higher than T2.

But the question says R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no, because the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps R1 = 2 R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

But from the Boltzmann equation, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So 2 R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

But R2 is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So substituting, 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)) = (-ΔE/(k T1) )

Rearranging:

ln(2) = [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) ] - [ (-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Which is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, let's compute that:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

But I can factor the terms:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Hmm, but I don't know ΔE or k's exact value, but perhaps the equation can be rearranged to match the given options.

Wait, the options are in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation needs to be written in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE.

But I don't have the value of ΔE, so maybe the problem expects an expression in terms of T1 and T2 without involving ΔE. Wait, that's not possible because the ratio R1/R2 depends on the temperatures and the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for the same energy level, the ratio of excited to ground state is twice as high in star_1. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, is that correct? Or is R1 = 2? Hmm, the wording says "twice as excited", so perhaps R1 = 2 for star_1 and R2 = 1 for star_2. But that would depend on the definition.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is such that n2_star1 / n1_star1 = 2 * (n2_star2 /n1_star2).

Wait, that's possible. So R1 = 2 R2.

So from the Boltzmann equation:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 => exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Which leads to:

[1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But I can factor that:

[ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = (k ln(2))/ΔE

But without knowing the values of k and ΔE, perhaps I can't compute this further. But the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant (k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me plug that in.

So the right-hand side becomes (k ln(2))/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K * ln(2)) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) [since 1.38e-23 cancels out].

So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Wait, but that's not correct. Because according to earlier, [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = (k ln(2)) / ΔE. Since k = 1.38e-23 J/K and ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, then (k ΔE) = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (1.38e-23 J) )? No, wait. No, I'm not multiplying, I'm dividing.

Wait, no: (k ln(2)) / ΔE = (1.38e-23 * ln(2)) / 1.38e-23 = ln(2). So yeah, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ). So the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Wait, but according to the earlier steps, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So rearranged, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So option D is the correct equation.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), \( T \) is the temperature, \( n_2 \) is the number of atoms in the excited state, and \( n_1 \) is the number of atoms in the ground state.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( R_1 = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \), and for star_2, it is \( R_2 = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \). The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \ln(2) \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
