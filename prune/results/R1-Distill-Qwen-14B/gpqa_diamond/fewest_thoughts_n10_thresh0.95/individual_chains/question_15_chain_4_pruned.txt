Okay, so I have this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one that's more likely to pass in front of its star from our point of view.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Period of Planet_1 (P1) is P, and Planet_2 (P2) is 3P. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. So higher mass but same radius—maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. Since stars with higher mass usually are bigger, but maybe these are in different stages. Oh, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as Planet_1's star. So, same R* for both.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula I recall is something like P = (R* / a) * (1), but I might be mixing it up. Wait, probability is roughly (R*/a) multiplied by something else? Or wait, no, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a), but only when the planet's orbit is edge-on. But for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the inclination, but on average, it's (R*/a) multiplied by (something else, maybe 1 or another factor). Let me think.

Wait, the probability that a planet transits is given by the formula P = (R*/a) * (1 + (m_planet / m_star)), but wait, m_planet is much smaller than m_star, so that term is negligible. So approximately, P ≈ R*/(a * (1 + m_planet/m_star)) ≈ R*/a. But since m_planet is same for both, and m_star is different, perhaps the mass of the star matters. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance from the star. So, P = R*/(a), but only if the orbit is edge-on. But for a random orbital inclination, the probability is actually P = (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (a/R*)) ) or something? No, wait, maybe it's more accurate to model this geometrically.

The probability can be thought of as the area where the planet's orbit would cause a transit, relative to the total possible area. So, the condition for a transit is that the planet's orbital plane is within an angle θ from our line of sight. The maximum angle θ where transit occurs is given by sinθ = (R*) / a. So, the area where θ is less than that is a circle with radius (R*/a). So the probability is (π (R*/a)^2) / (π (1)^2) ) = (R*/a)^2. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area where a transit occurs to the total possible area, which is (R*/a)^2 * (something). Or maybe it's 2R*/a divided by the sum of something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another way to think of it: for a distant observer, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is (R*/a). Because the planet's orbital plane must be within a certain angle relative to our line of sight. The condition is that the planet's orbital plane is within an angle θ where sinθ = R*/a. The probability is the ratio of this area to the total possible area. So, the solid angle where transit occurs is a circle with radius R*/a. The total possible solid angle is 2π (since the orbit can be in any orientation, the angle θ can vary from 0 to π/2, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating).

Alternatively, I've read that the probability of transit is approximately (R*/a), but only when a >> R*. Which is usually the case for planets. So, in that case, P ≈ R*/a.

Wait, but wait, some sources say the probability is about (R*/a) * (something else). For example, considering the planet's orbit, the probability is actually (R*/a) multiplied by (1/(1 + (a/(R*)) ) ), but no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's (R*/a) times (something about the star's size relative to the planet's orbit). Maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, let me recall. The formula for the probability that a given planet transits its star is:

P = (R*/a) / (1 + R*/a)

Wait, no, that can't be. Because when R*/a is small, you can approximate P ≈ R*/a, which is correct. For example, if a is much larger than R*, then R*/a is small, and the probability is roughly R*/a. So the formula must be P = (R*/a) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps it's P = (R*/a) * (1), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The probability P is given by:

P = (R* + R_p) / a

But since R_p (planet radius) is much smaller than R*, we can approximate it as (R*)/a. So P ≈ R*/a.

But wait, in this question, the planet radius isn't given. Both are Earth-like, so same radius. But since R* is the same for both stars (as per the question), R* is same for both. So for both planets, R_p is same, but R* is same. So the probability depends only on a.

Wait, but no, wait, R* is same for both stars. Both host stars have same radii. So R*1 = R*2 = R.

So, the probability for each planet is roughly (R*/a) for each.

Therefore, to find which planet has a higher probability, I need to compare (R*/a) for each.

So, first, I need to find the semi-major axis a for each planet.

We can use Kepler's third law to find a.

Kepler's third law in terms of period and star mass is:

a^3 = G * (M*) * (P^2) / (4π²)

So, a = [ G * M* * (P^2) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

But we can relate a1 and a2.

Given that:

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P

P2 = 3 P

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

For Planet_1:

a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1^2) / (4π²)

For Planet_2:

a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2) / (4π²)

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3:

= [ (G M1 P1^2) / (4π²) ) ] / [ (G M2 P2^2) / (4π²) ) ]

= (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2)

Given that M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P, P2 = 3P.

So,

= (2) * [ (P^2) / ( (3P)^2 ) ) ]

= 2 * [ P² / (9 P²) ) ] = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

Taking cube root: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculate that: 2/9 is approximately 0.222.

Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606. Let me check: 0.6^3 is 0.216, 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Alternatively, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no: wait, a1^3 / a2^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Wait, 9/2 is 4.5, cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65.

So a2 = a1 * 1.65.

So a2 is longer than a1.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is approximately (R* / a).

But R* is same for both. So P1 = R* / a1, P2 = R* / a2 = R* / (1.65 a1) ≈ P1 / 1.65.

Wait, no: a2 is 1.65 a1, so a2 = 1.65 a1.

So P2 (transit probability) = R* / a2 = R* / (1.65 a1) = (R* / a1) ) * (1/1.65) = P1 * (1/1.65).

So P2 = P1 * (1/1.65).

Which implies that P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a1 is smaller than a2, R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but let me recheck the math.

We have M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P, P2 = 3P.

So,

a1^3 = G * M1 * P^2 / (4π²)

a2^3 = G * M2 * (3P)^2 / (4π²) = G * M2 * 9 P^2 / (4π²)

So, a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 * P^2) / ( M2 * 9 P^2 ) ) = 2/(9) → as before.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a2 is larger than a1.

So the semi-major axes are a1 < a2.

So when you compute R*/a:

P1 is R* / a1.

P2 is R* / a2.

Since a2 is larger, P2 is smaller than P1.

So Planet_1 has higher transit probability. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

But wait, the question says that the host stars have the same radii. So R*1 = R*2.

So, the conclusion is, Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit.

Now, what about the actual ratio of probabilities.

Let me compute it.

We have P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2.

But a2 = (9/(2))^(1/3) a1.

Wait, no, wait: a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So, a2 = a1 / (2/9)^(1/3) → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

So, since (9/2) is 4.5, cube root is ~1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

Therefore, P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) * (R*/a1) = (1/1.65) * P1.

So, P1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, no: wait, P1 is R*/a1, P2 is R*/a2 = R* / (1.65 a1) = (R*/a1) * (1/1.65) → so P2 = (1/1.65) P1. So P1 is larger than P2 by a factor of 1.65.

So, the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So it's more likely to transit.

Therefore, the researchers should choose Planet_1, which has a higher probability.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, so according to my calculation, it's 1.65 times higher. So option C.

But wait, let
