Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the surface affect certain ratios of atomic levels. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. The ratio of levels 1 to 2 decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

I remember that in a star's photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the populations of energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition between the two levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far UV. I think the wavelength might be used to find the energy difference between the levels. Oh right, because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

So first, I'll calculate the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Let me get the constants right. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me calculate that. Let's see: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1448e-10 is 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but wait. I think in the Boltzmann factor, it's ΔE/(kT), so I'll need ΔE divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. So let me compute ΔE/(k*T) for both temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the spots change the effective temperature. But wait, when a star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature changes. But the star's photosphere is in LTE, so each element's ionization and excitation are determined by the local temperature. Oh, but wait, when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the average T is 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because the spots themselves are cooler, but the overall effect on the star's output is such that the effective temperature is lower.

But the question states that when the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature in that case. Or maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest are at 6000 K. Hmm, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or does it mean that the average is 5500 K?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the star's overall emission is that of a blackbody at 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the effective temperature is an average based on the areas. So, without spots, the star emits as a blackbody at 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is cooler, the star's overall emission is equivalent to a blackbody at 5500 K.

But what about the photosphere's temperature? Maybe the regions not covered by spots are at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature. But the problem says the "overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." Hmm, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present. I think I need to proceed under the assumption that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the photosphere is now at that temperature.

Wait, but wait. The overall Teff is a measure of the star's luminosity and radius. Luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the total luminosity would be 0.6 * L_unspotted + 0.4 * L_spotted.

But the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K, so the star now has an effective temperature of 5500 K. That would imply that the average blackbody emission is as if the entire star is at 5500 K.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me focus on the main question: the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

When the star has no spots, T is 6000 K. When it has spots, T is 5500 K. So the ratio when no spots (R1) is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)), and when there are spots (R2) is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k *5500)).

Wait, but wait. The ratio R is n1/n2. So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g1/g2) 

Similarly, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g1/g2 )

Wait, no. Because the formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), so if E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since T is in denominator), so the ratio becomes smaller.

Because with lower T, the exponential term decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. So that's why when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio R2 is smaller than R1.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches this.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2.

So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, because:

R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]

The (g1/g2) cancels out, so we get exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which can be rewritten as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no. Because in the numerator, it's -ΔE/(k T1), denominator is -ΔE/(k T2). So when you divide them, it's ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, R1 = A * exp(-x), R2 = A * exp(-y), where x=ΔE/(k T1), y=ΔE/(k T2). So R1/R2 = exp( (-x) - (-y) ) = exp( y - x ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute y - x: y is ΔE/(k T2), x is ΔE/(k T1). So y - x = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but ΔE is positive because E2>E1. So if T2 < T1, then 1/T2 > 1/T1, so (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive. So
