Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, relativistic, so that probably means I need to consider special relativity effects here. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options involve some equations with c, the speed of light, so I think relativistic effects are definitely in play.

Wait, in a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA^2/m), right? That's because when the potential energy is maximum (at x=A), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So in the non-relativistic case, that's the formula. But here, the options include some with c, so it's relativistic—so maybe the speed isn't just that simple formula anymore.

So I should think about how relativity affects this. In special relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of the oscillator must be considered in terms of relativistic energy.

The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in the relativistic case, I think the energy might be different. Wait, but maybe in this problem, they're using the classical expression for potential energy but adjusting the total energy relativistically.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)kA². But relativistically, the kinetic energy would be different.

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in this case, the oscillator's energy might not just be K.E. plus P.E. because it's a relativistic system. Maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but let me think. In a classical oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. At equilibrium (when x=0), all the energy is kinetic, which is (1/2)mv_max². But in the relativistic case, when x=0, the mass has maximum velocity, so the kinetic energy would be higher than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but perhaps the system's total energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. But this potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, when the velocity is zero, the total energy is just the rest mass energy, E_rest = mc². But wait, that can't be right because when x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching it wrong. Perhaps the total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Because when x=A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is stored as potential, plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, so at x=A, the velocity is zero. So the total energy E_total would be (1/2)kA² + mc². Because the rest energy is mc² and the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in the non-relativistic case, at x=A, the energy is (1/2)kA², and all is potential. But relativistically, the total energy is higher because the mass increases when moving? Or is it that the potential energy is part of the system's total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. So, in the case where x=A, the kinetic energy is zero (so v=0), so the total energy is just the potential energy plus the rest energy? Or is the potential energy just (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is separate?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc². Because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc².

But then, at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy would be E_total, which is (1/2)kA² + mc². So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc² = (E_total - mc²) = (1/2)kA².

So (gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (1/(2mc²)) * kA².

Wait, let's write that equation again.

We have:

Kinetic energy at x=0 is (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Because (1/2 k A²) / (m c²) )= (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2 / c² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, let me write this as:

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, let me call it term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + term

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + term

Let me solve for v.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + term)^2

So,

(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + term)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + term)^2 ]

Take reciprocal,

v²/c² = [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2 )

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 term + term² - 1 ) / (1 + term)^2

= (2 term + term² ) / (1 + term)^2

Factor numerator: term (2 + term )

Denominator: (1 + term)^2

So,

v²/c² = [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor it more.

Wait, maybe I can write it as:

v²/c² = term (2 + term) / (1 + term)^2

Let me take term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

This is getting messy. Maybe I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor out the term.

Let me denote term = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v² = c² [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2

Let me expand the numerator:

term (2 + term ) = 2 term + term^2

Denominator: (1 + term )^2 = 1 + 2 term + term^2

So,

v² = c² [ 2 term + term² ] / (1 + 2 term + term² )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is 2 term + term² = term (2 + term )

Denominator is (1 + term )^2 = 1 + 2 term + term².

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out term from numerator and denominator.

Wait,

v² = c² [ term (2 + term) ) ] / ( (1 + term )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor (1 + term) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, 2 + term = (1 + term) + 1.

So,

2 + term = (1 + term) + 1.

So,

v² = c² term [ (1 + term ) + 1 ] / (1 + term )^2

= c² term [ 1 + (1)/(1 + term) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

v² = c² * [ (2 term + term²) / (1 + 2 term + term²) ]

Let me see, perhaps I can factor term^2 from numerator and denominator.

Wait,

= c² * [ term (2 + term) ) / ( term^2 ( (1/term^2) + 2/(term) + 1 ) ) ]

Wait, that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let term be small. Because if term is small (k A²/(2 m c²) is much less than 1), then the expression can be approximated. But I don't think the problem is assuming that, as the options don't seem to make that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate it into one of the given options.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, but that in the denominator, 1 minus something. Hmm. Let me see:

Wait, our expression is v² = c² * [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term )^2

But term is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Hmm. Let me see if this can be manipulated into a form matching any of the options.

Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

[ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Let me write this as [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Let me factor 2 from numerator:

= [ term ( 2 (1 + 0.5 term )) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Wait, that's not too helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can split the fraction:

= [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2.

= [ 2 term + term^2 ] / (1 + 2 term + term^2 )

Hmm. Let me write this as:

= [ 2 term + term^2 ] / (1 + 2 term + term^2 )

= [ term (2 + term ) ] / (1 + term )^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as [ term (2 + term ) ] divided by (1 + term ) squared.

Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as (1 + term ) squared, which is 1 + 2 term + term squared.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as [ term (2 + term ) ] = term (1 + term + 1 ) = term ( (1 + term ) +1 )

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as [ term (2 + term ) ] = term (2 + term ) = 2 term + term^2.

Hmm.

Wait, let me compute the ratio:

(2 term + term^2 ) / (1 + 2 term + term^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: term^2 + 2 term = term ( term + 2 )

Denominator: (term + 1 )^2.

So,

( term ( term + 2 ) ) / ( term +1 )^2.

Let me see if this can be written as [ term ( term + 2 ) ] / ( term +1 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as [ term ( term + 2 ) ] / ( term +1 )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can rewrite the denominator as (term +1 )^2 = (term +1 )(term +1 )

Numerator: term (term + 2 ) = term ( term +1 +1 )

Which is term ( (term +1 ) + 1 )

So,

= term [ (term +1 ) + 1 ] / (term +1 )^2.

= [ term (term +1 ) + term ] / (term +1 )^2.

= [ term (term +1 ) ] / (term +1 )^2 + term / (term +1 )^2.

= term / (term +1 ) + term / (term +1 )^2.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this expression as:

= [ (2 term + term^2 ) ] / (1 + 2 term + term^2 )

= [ term (2 + term ) ] / ( (1 + term )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

= term / (1 + term ) * (2 + term ) / (1 + term )

= [ term/(1+term) ] * [ (2 + term)/(1 + term) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate it into an expression like 1/(1 - something ) or something.

Wait, looking back at the options. Let me see.

Option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that would mean v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - term') ), where term' is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, our expression is more complicated than that.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, let's see. Let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + term')^2.

Which is [ (1 + term')^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term')^2 )

= [ 1 + 2 term' + term'^2 -1 ] / (1 + term')^2

= [ 2 term' + term'^2 ] / (1 + term')^2

Which is exactly what our expression is! Because in our case, v^2 = c^2 * [ 2 term' + term'^2 ] / (1 + term')^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 term' + term'^2 ] / (1 + term')^2 )

Which is

c * sqrt( (2 term' + term'^2 ) / (1 + term')^2 )

= c * sqrt( [term' (2 + term') ] / (1 + term')^2 )

But looking at option D: option D has v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly sqrt( [2 term' + term'^2 ] / (1 + term')^2 )

So, option D is the same as our expression. So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Let me compute the expression in option D.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

Compute 1 - 1/(something)^2:

= [ (something)^2 - 1 ] / (something)^2

= [ something^2 -1 ] / something^2

Which is (something -1)(something +1) ) / something^2.

But in our case, v^2 = c^2 * [ 2 term' + term'^2 ] / (1 + term')^2.

Which is equal to c^2 * [ term' (2 + term') ] / (1 + term')^2.

So when you factor the numerator:

2 term' + term'^2 = term' (2 + term' )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ term' (2 + term') ] / (1 + term')^2 

= c^2 [ term' (2 + term' ) ] / (1 + term')^2.

Which is the same as [ (2 term' + term'^2 ) ] / (1 + term')^2.

Which is the same as [ ( [1 + term']^2 -1 ) ] / (1 + term')^2.

Wait, no. Because (1 + term')^2 = 1 + 2 term' + term'^2.

So,

[ (1 + term')^2 -1 ] = 2 term' + term'^2.

Which matches the numerator in v^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (1 + term')^2 -1 ] / (1 + term')^2.

= c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + term')^2 ]

Which is exactly option D's expression.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic regime, the total energy of the system is conserved and includes both rest mass energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic energy expression:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E_{\text{total}} \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
