Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations, which could look like an exoplanet transit. Hmm, okay.

So the star has the same radius as the Sun, right? And one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. Oh wait, wait. Filling factor is the area of the spots relative to the hemisphere, so if the hemisphere is half the star's surface, then the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². Wait, no, actually, filling factor is the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. Oh wait, no, I might be getting confused. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So if the hemisphere is half the star, then the total area is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The star's total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². If the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the total spotted area is 0.4 π R².

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot is 5000 K. 

The question is about the star's brightness variations due to these spots. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip as the spots rotate into the line of sight. This can mimic the transit of an exoplanet, which blocks some of the star's light as it passes in front.

The problem asks: What would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star? So, the goal is to find R_pl / R_star such that the planet's transit causes the same brightness variation as the spots cause.

First, I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by a planet transiting the same star.

When spots are on the surface, their lower temperature means they emit less light. So the total flux from the star will decrease when a spot is facing us. But since the spots are on a hemisphere, and the star is rotating, the amount of flux blocked depends on the rotation and how much of the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but actually, the brightness variation comes from the spots' area and their lower brightness. So when the star rotates, the spotted area that's visible changes. But wait, the star is being observed, and only one hemisphere is spotted. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. The brightness variation would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when part of the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model
