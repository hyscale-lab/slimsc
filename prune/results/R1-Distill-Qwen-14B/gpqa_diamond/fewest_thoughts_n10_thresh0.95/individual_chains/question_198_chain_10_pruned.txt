Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the "blue dithiocyanato" complex refers to. I remember that in coordination chemistry, different complexes can have different colors because of the d-d transitions in the metal ions. For cobalt, the hexaaquachromium is pink, but when SCN- replaces water, you get different colors. I think Co(SCN)_2^2+ is blue, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So the question is asking about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

Stability constants, β, are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes. The general formula for the formation of a complex is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^2- (n might vary, but in this case, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), since each SCN is a −1 charge. Wait, let me think. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for n=1: Co(SCN), charge would be +1? Wait, that doesn't make sense because Co is +2 and SCN is -1. Oh wait, no: the complex formula would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+n}? No, wait, each SCN is -1. So for n SCN, the charge would be 2 + (n * (-1)) = 2 - n. So for n=1, [Co(SCN)]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Wait, that can't be right because most transition metal complexes are neutral or have charges that would allow them to be stable in solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the complexes as [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

So for each n, the charge would be 2−n. So for βn, each β represents the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4).

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So we're looking for [Co(SCN)_2]^0. That's the species with two SCN- ligands.

But wait, how do the stability constants relate to the concentrations of these complexes? The stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So for each n, βn is the constant for the reaction:

n SCN^- + Co^2+ ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

Wait, no, the general formula for the nth complex would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

The βn is the formation constant, given as the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

So the problem is about finding the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the n=2 complex.

The total concentration of cobalt is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But the total includes all species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, and any others (but probably up to n=4 here since β4 is given).

We need to find the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the total Co.

So the first step is to model the speciation of Co in the solution.

The approach is to consider all possible complexes and find their concentrations in terms of the free Co^2+ ion.

But with multiple complexes, the equations can get complicated. Let me think about how to approach this.

Each complex formation can be written as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, with βn as the formation constant.

But since SCN^- is present in significant concentration (0.1 M), all the complexes can form. The free [Co^2+] will be very low because of the high concentration of SCN^-.

The problem is to find the fraction of Co in each possible complex. We can model this using the formation constants.

But considering that the formation constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but these β values are for each step. Or are they overall stability constants for the nth complex? I think they are the overall formation constants for each complex. Let me clarify.

The stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So each βn is the cumulative constant for the n-th complex.

So to find the concentrations of each species, I'll need to set up equations based on the formation constants.

The initial total concentration of Co is 0.01 M. Let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentrations of the various complexes can be written in terms of x and the βn.

But since the concentration of SCN^- is fixed at 0.1 M, we can treat it as a constant. Let me denote [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

But wait, SCN^- is in solution, and assuming that it's a 0.1 M solution, and the Co concentration is 0.01 M, which is much lower, we can consider that [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M throughout.

So, the concentration of each complex species can be expressed as:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, that's only if we have the nth complex as the only one, but in reality, all complexes coexist. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, that's only the case if the lower-order complexes are not present, which is not the case. So I think a better approach is to use the total concentration of Co and set up the equations accordingly.

The total Co concentration is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Which can be written as:

c_total = x + β1 x [SCN]^1 * [SCN] + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4.

Wait, no. Wait, each [Co(SCN)_n] is βn x (SCN)^n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn x (SCN)^n.

So, the total Co is:

x + β1 x (SCN) + β2 x (SCN)^2 + β3 x (SCN)^3 + β4 x (SCN)^4 = c_total.

Substituting SCN as 0.1 M.

So,

x [1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 0.01.

We can plug in the β values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*(0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01= 0.4

β3*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

β4*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

So the sum inside the brackets is:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's add them up.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So,

x * 2.3646 = 0.01.

Solving for x: x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

So, [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004223 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn x (0.1)^n.

Let's compute each:

n=0: [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004223 M.

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x (0.1) = 9 * 0.004223 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004223 ≈ 0.0038007 M.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.004223 * 0.01 =40 * 0.00004223 ≈ 0.0016892 M.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 x (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.004223 * 0.001 =63 * 4.223e-6 ≈ 2.660e-4 M.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 x (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.004223 * 0.0001 =16 * 4.223e-8 ≈ 6.7568e-7 M.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all cobalt species. So we take its concentration divided by the total Co concentration (c_total=0.01 M) multiplied by 100.

Wait, but wait the total concentrations already sum to 0.01 M. So the percentage is [Co(SCN)_2] / 0.01 * 100%.

But let me compute the [Co(SCN)_2] we found: 0.0016892 M.

So the percentage is (0.0016892 / 0.01)*100 = 16.892%.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 16.89%. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 42.3%

B) 25.6%

C) 38.1%

D) 16.9%

Hmm, 16.89% is close to D) 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Wait a moment, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make an error. Because sometimes the β values can be for stepwise formation rather than cumulative, but in this case, the problem states they are stability constants, so I think they are cumulative.

Wait, another thing to consider: the question might be referring to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN- ligands, which is n=2. But another possibility is that dithiocyanato refers to two SCN- as a dithiocyanato ligand, which would be a different scenario. But I think in this context, n=2 refers to two SCN- ligands, forming the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

Wait, but another thing: when considering the stability constants, sometimes they are given as log β, but here the values are given as β, so I think I used them correctly.

Let me recalculate the [Co(SCN)_2] concentration.

β2 =40, x=0.004223, (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 40 * 0.004223 *0.01 =40 * 0.00004223.

0.00004223 *40 = 0.0016892 M.

So that's correct.

So the percentage is (0.0016892 / 0.01)*100 = 16.892%, which rounds to 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I have another thought. Maybe the question is about the blue color, which could be a different complex. I'm a bit unsure whether the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or another form. But from what I remember, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, but wait, no, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would have a charge of +2. But wait, according to the earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the n=2 complex.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge calculation earlier. Let me re-examine.

Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. For n=2, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, since 2*(−1) + 2 = 0. So that's correct.

But some sources say that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex is blue. Hmm. I might be mixing things up. Let me try to recall. The Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex is actually blue, but wait, that would imply a charge of +2, which would require Co^2+ plus two SCN^- ions would give [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps it's the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex that's blue. Let me think. The common blue complex is the hexaaquachromium(III), but for cobalt, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue. But I might be getting this mixed up with other metal ions.

If the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would imply n=4? No, wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− would have four SCN^- ions, each contributing -1, and Co^2+ would be +2. So 2 + 4*(-1) = -2. So [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. But then what about the [Co(SCN)_2] complex?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formation constants are in a different order. Let me check the stability constants again.

Wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, β3 is the largest, which would suggest that the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But wait, that might not be correct. The largest β value indicates the most stable complex. So [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, which is larger than β2=40 and β4=16.

But if β4=16 is the fourth complex, perhaps that's [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation. Because if I'm looking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, that is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the calculation I did before leads to approximately 16.9% which is option D.

But the options don't have any option with 16.9% except D.

Wait, but wait, another approach: considering that the problem is about the species' distribution, perhaps I should consider that the formation constants are stepwise, not cumulative. Wait, no, the problem states they're stability constants, which are cumulative.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the fraction contributed by each species. Let me compute the molar amounts again.

Total Co = sum of all [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum inside the equation.

Let me re-calculate:

1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.01) + β3*(0.001) + β4*(0.0001).

So:

β1*(0.1) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*(0.01)=40 *0.01=0.4

β3*(0.001)=63 *0.001=0.063

β4*(0.0001)=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Adding these:

0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3

1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363

1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.

Wait, no, wait, no. The original sum is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Wait, 1 plus 0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 plus 0.4 is 2.3.

2.3 plus 0.063 is 2.363.

2.363 plus 0.0016 is 2.3646.

Ah, that's correct. So x=0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004223 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 * x * (0.1)^2.

β2=40, x=0.004223, (0.1)^2=0.01.

40 * 0.004223 = 0.16892, then multiply by 0.01 gives 0.0016892 M.

So the percentage is (0.0016892 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.892%, which is approximately 16.9%, so option D.

But I'm a bit concerned because the problem is about dithiocyanato, which I thought is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, but according to the calculation, that's n=2 and charge 0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the name.

Wait, let me think again. Dithiocyanato would mean two thiocyanato groups. So whether they are in the same complex or not. But the charge would be determined by the number of SCN- and the Co. So for n=2, the charge is 0. So the formula is [Co(SCN)_2].

But the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. Another possibility is that the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which would have four SCN- ions. Let me compute the concentration of that as well.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β4 * x * (0.1)^4.

β4=16, x=0.004223, (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So 16 * 0.004223 = 0.067568, multiplied by 0.0001 gives 0.0000067568 M.

So that's about 6.7568e-6 M, which is much smaller than the [Co(SCN)_2] concentration.

So if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, the percentage would be negligible.

But the question is specifically about dithiocyanato, which I think refers to two SCN- groups. So the correct complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the answer I'm getting is option D, but looking at the options, another option is B)25.6%. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum. Let me re-calculate the sum inside the equation.

1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)

= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Adding these together:

1.0

+ 0.9 → 1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 → 2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

So x=0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * 0.004223 *0.01 = 0.0016892 M.

Percentage is (0.0016892 / 0.01) *100 = 16.892%, which is 16.9%, option D.

I think that's the correct answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the speciation of cobalt under the given conditions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are provided as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constant βn represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth cobalt thiocyanato complex:  
   \[
   \text{Co}^{2+} + n \text{SCN}^- \leftrightarrow [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n}, \quad K = \beta_n
   \]  
   Using these constants, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ] = x\) and \([ \text{SCN}^- ] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\):  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2-n} = \beta_n x (0.1)^n
   \]

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:  
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}]
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each species:  
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = x + \beta_1 x (0.1) + \beta_2 x (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 x (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 x (0.1)^4
   \]  
   Substituting \(c_{\text{total}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}\) and the given β values:  
   \[
   x \left[ 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.01) + 63(0.001) + 16(0.0001) \right] = 0.01
   \]  
   Compute the terms inside the brackets:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]  
   Solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   x = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004223 \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]^0\) is given by:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2
   \]  
   Substituting \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(x = 0.004223 \, \text{M}\), and \((0.1)^2 = 0.01\):  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 = 40 \cdot 0.004223 \cdot 0.01 \approx 0.0016892 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**:  
   The percentage of \([ \text{Co(SCN)}_2 ]^0\) among all cobalt species is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0}{c_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.0
