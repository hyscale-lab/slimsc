Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of an enolate on a beta, gamma-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Wait, no, wait—Michael addition is when a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, right?

The question has three parts. Let me take them one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH. So, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In such conditions, I think the base deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a strong nucleophile when deprotonated.

The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor. Wait, the structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent being p-tolyl. So, the acrylate is the acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me visualize that. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the middle carbon. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me think. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-CH3. So, the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- (ester). So, the substituent is on the central carbon.

Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me correct. The correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the numbering is probably different. Acrylates have the structure CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate chain. But wait, acrylate is only three carbons (CH2=CHCOO-). So, position 3 is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, maybe I should think about it as a substituent on the acrylate chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2, which is the alpha to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a p-tolyl group on C2. So, the molecule is (E)-configured, but I'm not sure how that affects the addition.

So, in the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position (C3) of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The beta position is the CH2 group. So, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate, which is a diester) would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 in CH2=C), leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, when the enolate attacks, the structure would add the malonate group to the CH2. Then, the product would have the malonate as a substituent on the CH2. After the addition, the product would have the two ester groups from the malonate attached to the acrylate structure.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. So, when it attacks, the enolate would be the base, which attacks the beta carbon. So, the structure becomes CH2-C(-O-OCH3)(-O-OCH3) added to the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps the product is the addition of the enolate to the acrylate, leading to a new carbon chain. Let me think. The malonate enolate would attack the acrylate's beta carbon, which is the CH2. So, the structure would become CH2-C(malonate)-C(p-tolyl)=COOCH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the product would have the malonate attached to the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the product as a new tricarboxylate. Since dimethyl malonate contributes two ester groups, and the acrylate contributes another, the product would have three ester groups.

Looking at the options, option A says A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that's a molecule where propane has three ester groups (trimethyl ester), with substituents on carbons 1 and 3. Wait, the structure would be OMe on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to name it. Trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Propane has three carbons. 1 and 3 positions have two methyl ester groups each. Wait, no—trimethyl would mean three methyl ester groups. Wait, propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have COOCH3 groups on carbons 1 and 3. Carbon 2 has the p-tolyl group. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C1)
      \
C(p-tolyl)
      /
O-C-OCH3 (on C3)

Wait no, the structure would be something like:

CH2(COOCH3)2–CH(p-tolyl)–COOCH3?

Wait, maybe it's more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C1)
|
C(COOCH3)-C(p-tolyl)
|
O-C-OCH3 (on C3)

No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product after Michael addition would add the malonate group to the acrylate, leading to a new carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the p-tolyl group is on the second carbon, with two ester groups on the first and third.

So, the first reaction's product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, options A and B have this for A.

Now, the second reaction is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+. Hmmm. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would be a bicyclic structure, where the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene ring (cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond). So, the structure is a piperidine ring connected to a cyclohexene ring at position 1.

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCH2CN, but in E configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN with the nitrile group on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN, with E configuration. Wait, but for but-2-enenitrile, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The nitrile is on C4. Wait, no. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. So, structure is CH2=CH–CH2–CN. The E configuration would mean the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But in this case, it's CH2– on one side and CH2CN on the other. Wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the substituents are CH2– and CH2CN. Since they are both CH2 groups, is there any possibility for cis or trans? Maybe not, but perhaps it's E for some other reason.

In this Michael addition, the nucleophile is the enolate from 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Wait, but wait—the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene. How does that form the enolate? Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring opens under certain conditions.

Wait, but the reaction is in MeOH and H3O+. Hmm, but MeOH is a solvent. H3O+ is acidic. Wait, but the piperidine is a base, so in acidic conditions, perhaps it's protonated. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is undergoing some reaction.

Wait, maybe the 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is being treated as a donor, acting as the enolate. So, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is conjugated with the piperidine. Wait, piperidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. If it's attached to a cyclohexene, the structure would be a bridged bicyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps the piperidine is where the enolate comes from. So, under the reaction conditions, which are MeOH and H3O+ (acidic), perhaps the piperidine is protonated, making the ring more electrophilic, leading to the formation of an enolate.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine compound is the nucleophile.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile has a nitrile group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. So, the double bond is conjugated to the nitrile, making it an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl analog. So, it's a good Michael acceptor.

So, the 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would act as the enolate donor. So, the enolate would attack the beta position (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile. So, the nitrile is on C4, but the attack is on C3.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. So, the beta position is the CH2 adjacent to the double bond. So, when the nucleophile (enolate) attacks that, we get a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but the enolate is from the piperidine-cyclohexene system. So, the attack would add the cyclohexene-piperidine group to the CH2 of the but-2-enenitrile.

But wait, let's think about the structure after the addition. The but-2-enenitrile after attack would have the cyclohexene-piperidine group attached to the CH2. So, the product would be CH2(cyclohexene-piperidine)-CH2-CN, but wait, that doesn't account for the double bond.

Wait, the Michael addition would form a new bond between the enolate and the beta carbon. So, the double bond would shift, perhaps leading to a single bond between C2 and C3, and the new group attached to C3.

So, the product would have the cyclohexene-piperidine group attached to the C3 (formerly the beta) of the but-2-enenitrile. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(cyclohexenyl-piperidinyl)CN.

Wait, but more accurately, the product would be CH2-CH2-C(-O...? No, wait, the addition is nucleophilic attack. So, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon, leading to a new single bond there. So, the double bond would move to between C1 and C2, making it but-1-ene. But wait, the original structure is E, but after addition, the double bond would shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, looking at the options. Option B says B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, that would be CH2-CH2-C-O-C6H10 (but the substituent is a cyclohexyl with an oxo group). Hmm.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So, the piperidine is attached to the cyclohexene at the 1-position. When the enolate forms, perhaps the ring opens or the double bond is involved in a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps when the enolate attacks the butenitrile, the cyclohexene ring remains intact. So, the product would have the cyclohexenyl group attached to the CH2 group of the butenitrile.

But I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the product structure. The butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. After Michael addition, the CH2 would be attached to the enolate's carbon. So, the product would be CH2-CH2-C(cyclohexenyl-piperidinyl)CN. Wait, but that would make it 3-(cyclohexenyl-piperidinyl)butanenitrile. Hmm, but the options have 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, perhaps the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexanone ring.

Wait, because when the enolate attacks, the ring might open or form a new ring. Alternatively, perhaps after the attack, the ring closes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, maybe the piperidine ring is part of a conjugate base. So, when the enolate attacks, the cyclohexene ring is involved. After the addition, perhaps the cyclohexene forms a cyclohexanone when the ring is protonated and the double bond is saturated.

Alternatively, when the enolate attacks, the cyclohexene ring might not be directly involved, but the piperidine's ring could contribute to the structure.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the options. Option B for part B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So that would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2, attached to the third carbon of butanenitrile.

So, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone ring attached to the butenitrile. That makes sense if the enolate attack led to the opening of the cyclohexene ring or some rearrangement.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So, the piperidine is connected to the cyclohexene. Perhaps when the enolate attacks, the cyclohexene ring remains intact, but the piperidine ring is part of the attacking nucleophile. So, the product would have the cyclohexene ring attached to the butenitrile's CH2 group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's move on to the third reaction and see if that helps.

Third reaction: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Let's see, cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1 and 3.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl) attached to this ring. So, the butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the third carbon is a ketone. So, it's CH2CH2CO- attached to the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. So, the structure is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but in reality, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C2, and the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one isn't possible because but has four carbons. Let me correct. The structure of but-3-en-2-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-one would be:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond is between C3 and C4, but in a four-carbon chain, that would be from C3 to C4, but butane is only four carbons long. So, but-3-en-2-one would be:

O
||
CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but that's five carbons. No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH3. No, that would be 3-en-2-one. So, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=CH-CO-CH3. Wait, that's but-3-en-2-one. So, the structure is CH₂=CH–C(O)–CH₃.

In the reaction, KOH and H2O are used. So, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. The reaction is a Michael addition? Because but-3-en-2-one is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, so it's a Michael acceptor.

So, C is the nucleophile, which attacks the beta position of the acceptor. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, let's see. The product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups (1,3-dione), and at position 2, a butyl group with a ketone on the third carbon. So, the butyl group is CH₂-CH₂-C(O)-CH3, but wait, no, because the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl). So, the butyl group is CH₂-CH₂-C(O)- attached to the ring.

Wait, but the butyl group would have four carbons, but in the product, the substituent is 3-oxobutyl: CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH3? No, no, wait. 3-oxobutyl is CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH3, but that's a four-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So, 3-oxobutyl would be (CH₂)₂COCH3? No, perhaps CO is on the third carbon.

Wait, 3-oxobutyl would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2–. But that's a four-carbon chain, but the ketone is on the first carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group where the third carbon is a ketone, so the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-C(O)- attached to the ring.

So, the nucleophile C must be attacking the beta position of but-3-en-2-one. The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with this substituent.

So, what is C? The reactant is C plus but-3-en-2-one to give the product. So, C is the nucleophile, which after the reaction becomes part of the product.

The product has a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. So, perhaps C is a compound that, when deprotonated, becomes an enolate which attacks the butenone.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the cyclohexane ring has two ketones at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 that is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

Wait, but the substituent is 3-oxobutyl, which is (CH₂)₂CO– group. So, the substituent is CH₂-CH₂-CO– attached to the ring.

So, the nucleophile must be a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a leaving group or perhaps a site for attack. Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile is an enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a ketone, so its enolate would attack the butenone.

Wait, but in the reaction, the product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent. So, perhaps the nucleophile is a compound that, upon attack, adds a group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The product has a cyclohexane ring, so the nucleophile must be providing that ring. So, perhaps C is a compound that when it attacks the butenone, forms the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione itself. But then, how does it react as a nucleophile? No, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a smaller molecule, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition where the enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone. So, the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the butenone (but-3-en-2-one), forming a new bond.

So, the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butenone via a new single bond. Let me visualize:

The butenone is CH₂=CH-C(O)-CH3. The enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the CH₂ group (beta position), so the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the CH₂, making a structure like cyclohexane-1,3-dione attached to CH₂-CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent at position 2 is a butyl group where the third carbon is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to the cyclohexane ring being connected to the butenone in such a way that the substituent forms a four-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options. Looking at option C, which says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Option D says C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone. So, the nucleophile must have a structure that, upon addition, forms that substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile is a compound that forms the cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile is a cyclohexenone, which upon attack forms a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone. So, the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butenone.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that gives a butyl group substituent. Maybe I should think about the specific options given.

Looking back at the options for part C:

Option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D says C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the third reaction's product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, in the product, the cyclohexane ring has two ketones and a substituent. So, the nucleophile must be providing the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps C is a cyclohexanone derivative that upon attack forms the larger ring.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) and the butenone. But I'm not seeing how they combine to form the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile is a smaller enolate, like from a diketone, attacking the butenone.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should proceed to the options and see which one fits.

Looking at option B, for part C, it's cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, if the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, that would mean that C is the nucleophile in the reaction. So, the reaction would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione (as enolate) attacking the butenone, leading to the product.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product comes from a different mechanism.

Wait, let me think again. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone on the third carbon. So, the structure would be:

cyclohexane-1,3-dione - CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons in total, which doesn't fit a butyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the substituent is butyl, which is four carbons. So, 3-oxobutyl would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-, but that's three carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-C(O)-, but that's three carbons. No, the substituent is butyl, so four carbons, but the ketone is on the third. Hmm, perhaps it's (CH₂)₂CO–, which is three carbons, but that's a propionyl group. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a conjugate addition where the enolate adds to the butenone, leading to a new six-membered ring.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should move to the options and see which option fits.

Looking at the options, the first part A is either option A or B (trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate) or option C and D (3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate).

If the first reaction is correct, then options A and B have A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So, perhaps that's the right product.

For the second reaction, options A and B have B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

The third reaction, looking at the product, if the product includes a cyclohexane ring with two ketones (1,3-dione) and a substituent, then the correct option would be where C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but looking at the options, only option B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, no: Option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, option C says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, option D says C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the starting material C must be something that, when reacted with butenone, gives this product.

If C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone. So, the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butenone. But I'm not sure how this leads to the substituent in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the options and see which one aligns best.

Looking at option B:

A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But the product from the third reaction is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which isn't exactly cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, if option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then the product is formed from that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the third reaction is an example of a conjugate addition where the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone, leading to a new ring structure.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should go with the options.

Given that, I'll try to match the options. For the first reaction, the product is A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (options A and B). For the second reaction, B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (options A and B). For the third reaction, C is either cyclohexane-1,3-dione (options B and C) or 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (options D).

But the product from the third reaction is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, if C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, then perhaps the reaction forms the substituent via a Michael addition. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the enolate of C adds to the butenone. So, perhaps C is a ketone that, when deprotonated, forms an enolate that attacks the butenone, leading to the product.

But I'm not sure without more information. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would lead to the product after attack. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option C's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione and B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, the product from the second reaction is option B's B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, the oxo group is a ketone, meaning the cyclohexane ring has a ketone. So, the product would be a cyclohexanone.

But the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. When the enolate attacks, perhaps the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexanone after protonation.

So, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, option A and B have this.

So, for the second reaction, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would mean the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexanone.

So, combining all this, the correct options are:

A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option B says:

A = same as above.

B = same as above.

C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, option B is:

A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Which matches with the third reaction's product being 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would require C to be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think option B is the right choice.


The Michael addition reactions involve nucleophilic attack on α-β unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Michael acceptors) by enolates or other nucleophiles. The analysis of the three reactions and the options provided is as follows:

### Reaction 1: Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-Tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt, EtOH
- **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile, forming an enolate upon deprotonation by NaOEt. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a tricarboxylate with the malonate group and the acrylate group combined.
- **Product**: The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, which matches options A and B.

### Reaction 2: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-But-2-enenitrile with MeOH, H₃O⁺
- **Reactants**: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine provides the nucleophile (enolate), and (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile-containing acceptor. After the reaction, the cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexanone ring due to protonation and stabilization.
- **Product**: The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, which matches options A and B.

### Reaction 3: C + But-3-en-2-one with KOH, H₂O → 2-(3-Oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- **Reactants**: The nucleophile (C) reacts with but-3-en-2-one, an α-β unsaturated ketone (Michael acceptor).
- **Mechanism**: The enolate of C attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, forming a new bond. The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a 3-oxobutyl substituent.
- **Product**: The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. For this reaction, **C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which matches options B and C.

### Final Answer
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction 3.
- **Option B**: Correct because it lists A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, all of which match the expected products.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it lists C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione but lists B as 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, which does not match the expected product of Reaction 2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction 3.
