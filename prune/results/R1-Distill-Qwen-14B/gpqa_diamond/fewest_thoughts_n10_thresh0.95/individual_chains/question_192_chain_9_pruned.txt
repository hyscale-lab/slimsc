Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let's see... Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor's radius is R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and there's a charge +q placed inside the cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R. Also, there's an angle θ between l and s.

I'm a bit confused, but I think I should start by recalling Gauss's Law because it's often useful for these kinds of problems. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon zero. So Φ = Q_enc / ε₀.

Wait, but how does that apply here? The conductor was initially uncharged, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor was uncharged, the charges inside would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Right, because the conductor is a conductor, the charges will redistribute.

So, when a charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part that's the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q. Because the total conductor charge is zero, so inner has -q, outer has +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface will distribute themselves uniformly. So the outer surface has a charge +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P should be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, right? So if the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, the sphere's outer radius is R, but P is outside, so L > R. But how do the induced charges affect this?

Wait, but the charge on the outer surface is +q. So the electric field at any point outside the conductor due to the outer charge would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is like that of a point charge at the center. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², right? Because L is the distance from the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1/(4πε₀) * q / L². That matches what I'm thinking. But wait, I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think again.

The conductor has a cavity, and the charge is placed inside the cavity. The induced charges are on the inner surface (-q) and the outer surface (+q). So the electric field outside the conductor, at point P, is due to the +q on the outer surface. So using the formula for a point charge, E = (k q)/L².

But wait, another thought. The problem says that the cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center. So the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is θ.

Wait, but in the conductor, the outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So the point P is outside, so the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, which is greater than R. So the electric field at P would be as if all the outer charge (which is +q) is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside depends only on the total outer charge.

Wait, but wait again, no. Because the conductor's inner surface is induced with -q, but the position of the +q inside the cavity might matter? No, because in a conductor, the charges in the cavity affect the inner surface, but the outer surface charge is determined by the total charge on the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity.

So the field outside is due to the +q at the center of the conductor. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's option B.

But wait, why are the other options present? Let me think. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That makes me think of the displacement from the cavity's center, but since P is outside, the conductor's outer surface would make the field as if the charge is at the conductor's center. So the displacement between P and the outer surface's center is L, not l.

Wait, no, wait. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L. So the field only depends on L, not on l, because the charge's distribution on the outer surface is uniform. So any point at distance L would have the same E, regardless of where the point is located in that sphere.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Due to the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface develops a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by the outer surface. Since the outer surface has a charge $+q$, the electric field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This follows from the principle of superposition and the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface of a conductor.

3. **Application of Coulomb's Law**: At point $P$, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E =
