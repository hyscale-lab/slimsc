Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the density matrix ρ, which is given as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, I should probably start by recalling what a density matrix looks like for a qubit.

A qubit can be represented as a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The computational basis states are |0> and |1>, right? So each of these can be written as vectors. |0> is [1; 0] and |1> is [0; 1]. 

The density matrix ρ is supposed to represent a state. Let's write out ρ based on the given expression. Expanding the terms:

ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (1/2)( [1 0; 0 0] + [0 0; 0 1] ) 

Adding these matrices together gives [1 0; 0 0] + [0 0; 0 1] = [1 0; 0 1]. Then multiplying by 1/2, we get ρ = (1/2)[1 0; 0 1], which is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a mixed state because the density matrix has diagonal elements but the off-diagonal terms are zero. Oh, right! A pure state would have the density matrix with trace squared equal to 1. The trace of ρ is 1 (since 1/2 + 1/2 =1), but the square of the trace is 1, and the trace of ρ squared is (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2. Since 1≠1/2, it's a mixed state. But wait, what exactly is this state?

In the Bloch sphere representation, qubit states are represented as points on the surface of a unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and the Bloch vector is r = [x, y, z], where x, y, z are related to the coefficients of ψ. For a mixed state, the Bloch vector has a length less than 1. 

So how do I find the Bloch vector for the given ρ? I think the general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Bloch vector components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices [σ_x, σ_y, σ_z], and r is the Bloch vector.

Let me compute each element of ρ. Our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2:

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. So if we have (I + r·σ)/2 = [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]], then r·σ must be zero matrix because (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ.

So, r·σ is a matrix where each element is zero. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So if we sum r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z, this must equal zero matrix.

Which implies that each coefficient must be zero. So:

r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y * [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]

Looking at each element:

Top left: r_z *1 =0 → r_z =0.

Top middle (assuming 2x2, it's top right in 2x2): r_x *1 + r_y*(-i) =0.

Similarly, bottom left: r_x *1 + r_y*(i) =0.

Bottom right: r_z*(-1) =0, which is same as r_z=0.

So from r_z=0, that's one component. Now, the equations for the other components:

r_x - i r_y =0

r_x + i r_y =0

Wait, let me check the equations. The (1,2) element is r_x (from σ_x) plus (-i r_y) (from σ_y) equals 0.

And the (2,1) element is r_x (from σ_x) plus (i r_y) (from σ_y) equals 0.

So,

r_x - i r_y = 0 → equation (1)

r_x + i r_y =0 → equation (2)

If I add these two equations: 2 r_x =0 → r_x=0.

Substituting r_x=0 into equation (1): 0 - i r_y =0 → r_y=0.

So all components of r are zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0).

Wait, but I thought the state (|0> + |1>)/√2 is on the equator of the Bloch sphere, but that's a pure state. Our state is a mixed state, so it's the completely mixed state, which should be at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0).

So the density matrix ρ here represents a completely mixed state. The completely mixed state's density matrix is (I/2), which is what we have here.

Now looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a qubit density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

This means the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct Bloch vector is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
