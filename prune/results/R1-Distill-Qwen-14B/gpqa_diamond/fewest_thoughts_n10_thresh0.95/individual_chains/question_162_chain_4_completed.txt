Okay, so I have this metric given and I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me look at the metric. It says ds² is equal to [32 divided by (4 - x² - y²)] times (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Because it's using dx and dy. So this is a 2D metric, probably in polar coordinates but expressed in Cartesian coordinates. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, wait, pseudospheres are surfaces in hyperbolic space, but maybe this metric is representing something else.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that. In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², where r is the radial coordinate. So the denominator becomes (4 - r²). So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). That makes it look like a 2-dimensional metric with a radial part and an angular part.

Wait, but if this is a 2D metric, then the area element would be sqrt(g) dr dθ, right? But wait, no, because the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dr² and dθ². So sqrt(g) would be the product of the square roots of the coefficients. Hmm, the coefficient for dr² is 32/(4 - r²), and for dθ² it's [32/(4 - r²)] * r². Wait, no, no, wait. Let's correct that: the metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

So the determinant of the metric tensor g is the product of the coefficients:

g = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = [32^2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2.

So the square root of that, sqrt(g), would be 32 r / (4 - r²). Because sqrt(32^2 r²) is 32 r, and denominator is (4 - r²).

Wait, wait, no. Because when you take the determinant of a diagonal matrix, it's just the product of the diagonal terms. So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32 * 32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = 32 r/(4 - r²).

So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dr dθ = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Now, the area would be the integral of this over the region where the metric is defined. So we need to find the limits for r. The denominator is (4 - r²), which must not be zero, so r² <4. So r can go from 0 to 2, because sqrt(4) is 2. So r ranges from 0 to 2.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

I can compute this integral. Let's first separate the integrals. The integral over θ is straightforward. It's 2π times the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

So compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr] / (4 - r²) = ∫ (32 (-du/2)) / u = ∫ (-16) (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, let me substitute:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits change: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So substituting, the integral from r=0 to 2 is the same as u going from 4 to 0. So we can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:

= -16 ∫_{4}^{0} (du/u) = 16 ∫_{0}^{4} (du/u) = 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

Wait wait, that doesn't make sense because at u=0, ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, but our substitution is from u=4 to u=0, which would involve integrating from 4 to 0, but the integral of 1/u is ln(u), which would be from 4 to 0:

So ∫ from 4 to 0 of (1/u) du = [ln u] from 4 to 0 = ln(0) - ln(4). But ln(0) is -infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity. So the integral is divergent, which would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, that suggests that the area is infinite. But wait, why is that happening? Let me think again. So the area element is [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ. As r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up. So the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try another approach. Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me set u =4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (32) (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/u.

Substituting, r dr = -du/2. So:

= 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln|u| + C.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

[-16 ln(4 - r²)] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2: 4 - (2)^2 =0, so ln(0) is -infty. So the upper limit is -16 * (-infty) = +infty. Lower limit at r=0: 4 -0=4, ln(4) is some finite value. So the integral becomes:

[-16 ln(0)] - [-16 ln(4)] = [infinite] + [finite], which is infinite.

So the area is 2π times this, which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So what's this about? A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Hmm, but in 2D, I thought the metric is for a space with curvature. Wait, perhaps the given metric describes a space with negative curvature, and when you compute the area, it's infinite, which would make sense because pseudospheres (tractricoids) are non-compact and have infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is defined on a sphere, but in this case, the denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, which would be similar to the behavior near the edge of a disk model of hyperbolic space. But then, the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the answer options include option D as +infinite. So that would be the case.

Another approach: the metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry. In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate (distance from the origin). Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which can be written as 4(1 - (r²/4)).

So our metric: 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - (r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So it's similar but scaled.

Wait, perhaps the radius of the Poincaré disk in this case is related to the 4 in the denominator. The standard Poincaré disk has a curvature that depends on the radius. The metric for a hyperbolic plane with curvature k is ds² = (4/k)/(1 - (r²/k R²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space is infinite because it's a complete surface of infinite extent.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, the radius of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is a bit different; it's defined in terms of the curvature. The radius R is related to the curvature κ as R = 1/√κ. So if the radius is 2, then κ=1/4.

But regardless, the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space would be finite or infinite? Wait, a pseudosphere is like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But the tractricoid is a finite surface. Wait, no, the tractricoid is a finite surface, a surface of revolution with finite area and finite volume (but it's a 2D surface, so volume isn't applicable). Wait, no, the tractricoid is a surface of infinite extent? Or is it compact?

Wait, no, the tractricoid is a finite surface. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The tractrix is a curve of infinite length, but when you make a surface of revolution, like the pseudosphere, it's actually a surface of finite area. Wait, no, no, wait. The tractrix itself is a curve that approaches an asymptote, but the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of revolution that has finite area. Because the surface area integral over the tractrix's generating curve from 0 to infinity would converge. Hmm, but how does that relate to the given metric?

Wait, but in our case, the metric given is in 2D, perhaps representing a hyperbolic space, and the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the metric of the hyperbolic plane and the metric of the pseudosphere itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided is that of a 2D hyperbolic space, and the area of a circle (or a "pseudosphere" which in 2D would be a circle) of radius r=2 would have an area computed using the metric.

Wait, but in 2D, the area of a circle (or in hyperbolic terms, a "disk") of radius r is (2π) sinh(r), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the area in hyperbolic geometry is 2π (cosh(r) -1 ), but I'm not entirely certain. But that's probably not relevant here since the metric given is different from the standard hyperbolic metric.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ. When I integrate this from r=0 to r=2, the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. So the answer would be option D, which is +infty.

So the options are:

A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C) 4π(x² - y²)
D) +infty

So the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2D metric expressed in Cartesian coordinates. Switching to polar coordinates, where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, \(g\), which is:

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right) \left(\frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\right) = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The square root of \(g\) is:

\[
\sqrt{g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - r^2\) implies that \(r^2 < 4\), so \(r\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\). The area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). In this context, the metric describes a hyperbolic-like space, and the pseudosphere corresponds to the region \(r \leq 2\). However, the area of this region is infinite due to the divergence of the integral near \(r = 2\). Thus, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.

Answer: D
