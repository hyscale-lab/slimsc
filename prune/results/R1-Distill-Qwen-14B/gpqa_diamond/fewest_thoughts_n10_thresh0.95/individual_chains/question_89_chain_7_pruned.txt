Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectral analysis. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. Finally, I need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR, excluding those that exchange.

Alright, let's break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and in such cases, dibromide might undergo elimination or substitution. Since it's heated, perhaps elimination is more likely. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions—so maybe the Brs are on opposite faces or something. But when KOH is used, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. So the product would be an alkene. Wait, but let's think: with KOH and a dihalide, especially vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, so maybe it's not elimination. Hmm, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Because adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a diamond lattice. So maybe the Brs are on adjacent carbons, making it a vicinal dihalide. So elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, but when KOH is used with a dihalide, it's typically a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So product 1 is probably 1,3-didehydroadamantane or something like that. Wait, but wait, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around the carbonyl region. Wait, that's interesting. Because elimination usually forms an alkene, but 1720 is more indicative of a carbonyl group. Oh wait, perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene but an epoxide? No, epoxide formation would require a different setup, like with peracid maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH could cause an SN2 substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Another possibility is that each Br atom is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, not an OH stretch. So maybe it's not a diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Wait, but for that, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that forms alkenes. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because an epoxide's carbonyl (C-O) is around 1200-1300 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or Aldol condensation, but that doesn't fit with KOH and dibromide.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet, perhaps. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) as a multiplet, and 1.94 (2H). Wait, the integration suggests 2H, 10H, and 2H. So the molecule has 14 H in total? Let's see: 2+10+2=14 H. Adamantane has 10 H in its structure. So product 1 has 14 H? Hmm, perhaps not, but maybe the structure adds some groups.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol? But the IR would have O-H stretches around 3300 cm-1, but the IR given is 1720. So that's not right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination to form an alkene, but then why the IR peak at 1720? Wait, wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, KOH in such cases can also cause a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial dihalide is treated with KOH and forms a carboxylic acid. But that would require hydrolysis, which is more likely under acidic conditions. Wait, but in this case, KOH is basic. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a ketone. Wait, if elimination occurs, but the structure forms a ring, perhaps leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, because the IR peak is 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back. The first step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the starting material is a di-Br, which upon treatment with KOH gives a diketone? How? Because each Br could be replaced by an O- group, but that would require oxidation. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a double bond, but then why the carbonyl? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each carbon connected to three others, and a four-membered ring structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on opposite positions of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, leading to a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But then again, where's the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Maybe it's an ester or ketone. So perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require something else, like aqueous work-up.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but to form an allene or something else. Or perhaps each Br is removed, and the two adjacent CH2 groups are converted to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the Brs is replaced by an OH, but that would need more specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the product is a Dieckmann cyclization product. But that requires esters and a base, which may not be the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should move forward and assume that product 1 has a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. Then, the second step is treating with Al(OiPr)3.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst. Common reactions include Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or something similar.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid. So maybe product 1 is an ester? For example, if the dibromide undergoes substitution to form an ester.

Wait, let me think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 with a carbonyl. Maybe the reaction is a double nucleophilic substitution, where each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diol. But that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the initial reaction is an elimination to form an epoxide. No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe the product is an amine. Wait, KOH is a base, but that doesn't directly lead to amines from dihalides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then some kind of oxidation. But with KOH, I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider alternative products. Product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 (10H), and a triplet at 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 singlet is possibly a -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide or a diether. But the IR has a carbonyl peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone adjacent to some CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: the NMR has 2H at 4.79. That's a singlet, so no neighboring H. Perhaps it's a methylene (CH2) group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2O in an epoxide. But then, the IR's 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, 4.79 could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone, maybe it's a CH2CO group. Wait, but in that case, the splitting would depend on neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But then the NMR would show more upfield peaks.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid group.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm-1. So 1720 is more towards a ketone or ester. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH gives a ketone. How? Perhaps it's a double elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide undergoes a substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would give a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the product of the first reaction as adamantanone. Adamantane has 10 carbons, so if one of the CH2 groups is oxidized to a carbonyl, it becomes a ketone. But where? Let me think: the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe the elimination of two HBr molecules forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? If two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, you could form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a ring-opening and forms
