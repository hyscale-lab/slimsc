Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to stability constants and complex speciation, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex... I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes. I remember that Co(SCN)n^m+ has different colors depending on n. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^– is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2– is maybe another color. But the question is about the blue one, which is the dithiocyanato complex, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be the n=2 complex. So the problem is asking for the percentage of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

Stability constants, β, represent how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The general formula for the nth complex is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co][SCN^-]^n.

Since there are four possible complexes (n=1 to 4), we need to find the fraction of each and sum them up to get the total, then find the fraction that is the n=2 complex.

The approach I think is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. The formation starts with the first complex, then the second, and so on, with each step having its own stability constant.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. I think that each β is the cumulative constant for forming the complex up to that n. Or maybe each β is for adding one SCN^- at a time. Let me clarify: βn is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ion. Or is it the overall formation constant for the nth complex?

I'm a bit confused, but I think βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN^- ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, β1=9; [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β2=40; [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63; and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β4=16.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the definitions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps βn is the stepwise formation constant, meaning the constant for adding the nth ligand. For example, β1 is the constant for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

In that case, the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for n=3, it's β1*β2*β3, and for n=4, β1*β2*β3*β4.

But wait, the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So if they are stepwise, the overall constants would be:

β_total(n) = product of β1 to βn.

So for n=1, β_total(1) = 9.

n=2: 9 * 40 = 360.

n=3: 9*40*63 = let's compute that. 9*40 is 360, 360 *63=22680.

n=4: 22680 * 16 = 362880. Wait, but that seems high, especially since β4 is 16, which is much lower than the others, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the given β values are cumulative or stepwise. Another possibility is that the β values are the overall constants for each complex. For example, β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So in that case, each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

But that doesn't align with the usual practice. Typically, βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So I think I need to proceed with the assumption that βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

So the overall formation constants for each complex are:

β1 = 9 (for n=1)
β_total(2) = β1 * β2 = 9 *40= 360
β_total(3) = 360 *63=22680
β_total(4)=22680 *16=362880

Wait, but that would mean that higher n complexes are way more stable, but β4 is lower than β3, which could mean that the fourth ligand is harder to add than the third. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but perhaps it's correct. Maybe the stability increases up to a point and then decreases, but I'm not certain.

But regardless, I'll proceed with this approach.

The next step is to calculate the fraction of each complex in solution. The fractions depend on the equilibrium between the different complexes and the free ions.

The general approach is to express each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co^2+ and SCN^- concentrations, using the stability constants.

Let me denote the concentration of Co^2+ as [Co^2+], and the concentration of SCN^- as [SCN^-].

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the complexes plus the free Co^2+:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^– + [Co(SCN)_4]^2– = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But wait, in this problem, the initial Co concentration is 1e-2 M, but all the Co is in solution as various species. So the sum of all Co species equals 1e-2 M.

The idea is to calculate the concentration of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But since the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, we can assume that the ligand is in excess, and the free [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M. So [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

Now, let's model each complex's concentration.

The concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_total(n) × [Co^2+] × [SCN^-]^n

But wait, for each n, the charge must balance. However, since the solution is neutral overall, we might have to consider that, but perhaps it's easier to model it using the stability constants as stepwise, and the expression for each complex is built upon the previous one.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of fractions.

Let’s define the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co^2+.

Let’s denote:

f0 = [Co^2+] / [Co^2+]_total
f1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / [Co^2+]_total
f2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / [Co^2+]_total
f3 = [Co(SCN)_3]^– / [Co^2+]_total
f4 = [Co(SCN)_4]^2– / [Co^2+]_total

Here, [Co^2+]_total is the sum of all fractions multiplied by the total Co concentration.

Wait, but another approach is to let [Co^2+] = x. Then, each complex's concentration is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_total(n) * x * (0.1)^n

But wait, for each complex, the expression would be:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_total(n) × [Co^2+] × [SCN^-]^n

So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * (0.1)

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β_total(2) * x * (0.1)^2

Similarly for n=3 and 4.

But wait, this would mean that the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1*β2*x*(0.1)^2.

Wait, but β_total(2) is β1*β2, so yes.

Now, the total concentration of all Co species is:

x (free Co^2+) + β1 x (0.1) + β_total(2) x (0.1)^2 + β_total(3) x (0.1)^3 + β_total(4) x (0.1)^4 = 1e-2

We can factor out x:

x [1 + β1 (0.1) + β_total(2) (0.1)^2 + β_total(3) (0.1)^3 + β_total(4) (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2

So, x = 1e-2 / [1 + β1*(0.1) + β_total(2)*(0.1)^2 + β_total(3)*(0.1)^3 + β_total(4)*(0.1)^4 ]

Wait, but let me calculate each term.

First, compute each term in the denominator:

Term 0 (n=0, free Co^2+): 1

Term 1 (n=1): β1 * (0.1) =9 * 0.1 =0.9

Term 2 (n=2): β_total(2) = 9*40=360; 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6

Term3 (n=3): β_total(3)=360 *63=22680; 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4 (n=4): β_total(4)=22680 *16=362880; 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So sum terms:

1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, but x is [Co^2+], the free ion concentration.

Now, the fraction of each complex is:

f0 = x / (1e-2) = (1.551e-4) / (1e-2) )= 0.01551 or 1.551%.

f1 = [CoSCN]^+ / 1e-2 = (β1 * x *0.1) /1e-2

Wait, no. Let me think again. The concentration of [CoSCN]^+ is β1 * x * (0.1).

So the fraction f1 is [CoSCN]^+ / total Co = (β1 x 0.1) / (1e-2) )

Which is β1 x 0.1 / (1e-2) = 9 * x *0.1 / (1e-2)

But x is 1.551e-4, so:

9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1 / 1e-2 = (9 * 1.551e-5) / 1e-2 = (1.3959e-4) / 1e-2 = 1.3959e-2, or 1.3959%.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should compute each fraction as (β_total(n) * (0.1)^n * x ) / (sum terms).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The fraction of each species is:

f0 = x / (x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2– )

But that's the same as x / (1e-2), because the sum of all species is 1e-2.

But to get each fraction, it's easier to compute each term as (β_total(n) * (0.1)^n * x ) / (sum of all terms in denominator), which is 64.468 x.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each [Co(SCN)_n] as β_total(n) * x * (0.1)^n.

Then, the fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n] / (1e-2).

So:

f0 = [Co^2+] / 1e-2 = x /1e-2 = (1e-2 /64.468) /1e-2 = 1/64.468 ≈ 0.0155 or 1.55%

f1 = [CoSCN]^+ /1e-2 = (β1 * x *0.1) /1e-2 = (9 * x *0.1 ) /1e-2

Substituting x=1e-2/64.468:

(9 * (1e-2/64.468) *0.1) /1e-2

= (9 * 1e-3 /64.468 ) / 1e-2 = (9e-3 /64.468) / 1e-2 = (9e-3 /64.468) *1e2 = (9e-3 *1e2) /64.468 = 9 /64.468 ≈ 0.14 or 14%.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me see:

Wait, x = 1e-2 /64.468.

So f1 = (β1 * x *0.1) /1e-2 = β1 * x *0.1 /1e-2 = β1 * (1e-2/64.468) * 0.1 /1e-2 = β1 * (0.1) /64.468.

So β1=9, so f1=9 *0.1 /64.468 = 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.01396, or 1.396%.

Wait, that's about 1.4% for [CoSCN]^+.

Similarly, f2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 /1e-2 = (β_total(2) * x * (0.1)^2 ) /1e-2.

β_total(2)=360.

So f2=360 * x *0.01 /1e-2.

Which is 360 * x * 0.01 /1e-2.

x is 1e-2 /64.468.

So f2=360 * (1e-2/64.468) * 0.01 / 1e-2.

Simplify:

360 * 1e-2 *0.01 / (64.468 * 1e-2 )

The 1e-2 cancels, so 360 *0.01 /64.468 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556, or 5.556%.

Wait, that's about 5.56%.

Similarly, f3 = [CoSCN3]/1e-2 = β_total(3) *x * (0.1)^3 /1e-2.

β_total(3)=22680.

So f3=22680 * x *0.001 /1e-2.

x=1e-2/64.468.

So:

22680 * (1e-2/64.468) * 0.001 /1e-2.

Simplify:

22680 * 1e-2 * 0.001 / (64.468 *1e-2 )

Again, 1e-2 cancels in numerator and denominator.

So 22680 *0.001 /64.468 = 22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3519, or 35.19%.

Wait, that's about 35.2%.

f4 = [CoSCN4]/1e-2= β_total(4) *x * (0.1)^4 /1e-2.

β_total(4)=362880.

So f4=362880 *x *0.0001 /1e-2.

x=1e-2/64.468.

So:

362880 * (1e-2/64.468) *0.0001 /1e-2.

Simplify:

362880 * 1e-2 *0.0001 / (64.468 * 1e-2 )

Again, 1e-2 cancels.

362880 * 0.0001 /64.468 = 36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629, or 56.29%.

Wait, but let me add up all f0 to f4:

f0 ≈1.55%

f1≈1.4% → but wait, earlier calculation for f1 gave about 1.4%, but when I recalculated using the f_n approach, it was 1.396%. Let's go with that as 1.4%.

Wait, but wait, when I calculated f1 using the denominator approach, I get 0.9/(64.468) which is approximately 0.01396, which is 1.396%.

Similarly, f2 was 3.6/64.468≈5.556%, f3 is 22.68/64.468≈35.19%, f4 is 36.288/64.468≈56.29%.

Wait, but wait, adding these up:

1.55 (f0) +1.396 (f1) +5.556 (f2) +35.19 (f3) +56.29 (f4) = Let's add step by step.

1.55 +1.396=2.946

+5.556 → 8.502

+35.19 →43.692

+56.29 →99.982.

Wait, but that's about 99.98%, which is close to 100, but not exactly. Hmm, maybe due to rounding errors. So the sum is about 100%, which is correct.

So the fractions are approximately:

f0: 1.55%

f1: 1.396%

f2: 5.556%

f3:35.19%

f4:56.29%

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so that's f2, which is 5.556%.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them is 5.55%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Where did I go wrong?

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the stepwise vs. overall stability constants. Maybe the given β values are the overall β for each complex.

Wait, perhaps the given βs are the overall β for each complex, not the stepwise. That would change everything.

Let me try that approach.

In that case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is βn, not the product of all stepwise βs up to n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, for each n, the concentration is βn * [Co^2+} * (0.1)^n.

Then, the total Co is:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+} (0.1) + β2 [Co^2+} (0.1)^2 + β3 [Co^2+} (0.1)^3 + β4 [Co^2+} (0.1)^4 =1e-2.

Factor out [Co^2+}:

[Co^2+} [1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] =1e-2.

So, [Co^2+}= 1e-2 / [1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01)+63*(0.001)+16*(0.0001) ]

Let me compute the denominator:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Compute step by step:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646.

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Thus, [Co^2+}=1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.228e-3 M.

Wait, that's a much higher [Co^2+} than before, which makes sense because the denominator is much smaller when using the overall βs.

Now, each fraction is:

f0 = [Co^2+} / 1e-2 = (4.228e-3) / (1e-2) = 0.4228 →42.28%.

f1 = [CoSCN]^+/1e-2 = (β1 [Co^2+} *0.1 ) /1e-2.

β1=9, so 9 *4.228e-3 *0.1 = 9 *4.228e-4 = 3.8052e-3.

Divide by 1e-2: 3.8052e-3 /1e-2 =0.38052 →38.05%.

f2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 /1e-2 = (40 *4.228e-3 *0.01 ) /1e-2.

40 *4.228e-3 = 0.16912.

0.16912 *0.01 = 0.0016912.

Divide by 1e-2: 0.0016912 /1e-2 =0.16912 →16.91%.

f3= (63 *4.228e-3 *0.001 ) /1e-2.

63 *4.228e-3 = 0.266364.

0.266364 *0.001 = 0.000266364.

Divide by 1e-2 →0.000266364 /1e-2 =0.0266364 →2.66%.

f4= (16 *4.228e-3 *0.0001 ) /1e-2.

16 *4.228e-3 = 0.067648.

0.067648 *0.0001 = 6.7648e-6.

Divide by 1e-2 →6.7648e-6 /1e-2 =6.7648e-4 →0.0676%.

Wait, but let's add up all the fractions:

42.28% +38.05% =80.33%

+16.91% →97.24%

+2.66%→99.90%

+0.0676%→99.97% approx.

So the sum is roughly 99.97%, which is close to 100%, considering rounding.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's f2, which is approximately 16.91%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

But wait, earlier with the first approach, the sum of the fractions was 99.98%, and [Co(SCN)_2] was around 5.55%, but that approach assumed the β were stepwise. But with this second approach, where β are overall, the [Co(SCN)_2] is around 16.9%.

Which approach is correct? Hmm.

I think the confusion comes from whether the given β are stepwise or overall. Since the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16," it's more likely that these are the overall stability constants for each complex, not stepwise.

Because, for example, the first complex [CoSCN]^+ would have β1=9, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have β2=40, etc. So each βn is the overall stability constant for that specific complex.

In that case, the second approach is correct, and the percentage of the blue complex is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the answer I got in the second approach for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.91%, which matches option D.

So the correct answer should be D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, **[Co(SCN)_2]^0**, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the speciation of cobalt using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Concentrations**:  
  - Total cobalt concentration: \( [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)  
  - Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)  
- **Stability constants**:  
  - \( \beta_1 = 9 \) (for \([CoSCN]^+\))  
  - \( \beta_2 = 40 \) (for \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\))  
  - \( \beta_3 = 63 \) (for \([Co(SCN)_3]^- \))  
  - \( \beta_4 = 16 \) (for \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\))  

The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) are interpreted as the **overall formation constants** for each complex, meaning they represent the equilibrium for the formation of the \( n \)-th complex directly from \( \text{Co}^{2+} \) and \( \text{SCN}^- \).

### Approach:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The concentration of each cobalt complex is proportional to its stability constant and the available ligand concentration. The fractions of the free cobalt ion and each complex are calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}}
   \]  
   where \( [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \) is the free cobalt ion concentration.

2. **Total Denominator**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each species, the denominator becomes:  
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 \cdot 0.1 + \beta_2 \cdot (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 \cdot (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 \cdot (0.1)^4
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 + 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 + 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Free Cobalt Ion Concentration**:  
   Using \( [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \), the free cobalt ion concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Fractions of Each Species**:  
   - Free cobalt (\( f_0 \)):  
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{[\text{Co}]^{\text{free}}}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} = \frac{4.228 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \approx 0.4228 \, (42.28\%)
     \]  
   - \([CoSCN]^+\) (\( f_1 \)):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 \cdot [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \cdot 0.1}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} = \frac{9 \cdot 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.1}{10^{-2}} \approx 0.3805 \, (38.05\%)
     \]

     \]

5. **Verification**:  
   The sum of all fractions is approximately \( 42.28\% + 38.05\% + 16.91\% + 2.66\% + 0.0676\% \approx 99.97\% \), which is consistent with the total cobalt concentration.

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\), is **16.9%**, which corresponds to **Option D**.
