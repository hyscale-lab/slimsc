--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because OChem can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane ring structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of this adamantane skeleton.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with bases, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Hmm, so maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation but perhaps in a different way. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate elimination? Let me think. Alternatively, since the positions are 1 and 3, perhaps the base can abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe a ketone? But how does that form from a dihalide?

Ah, wait. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone. Oh, wait, another possibility: when two adjacent dihalides are present, heating with a base could lead to elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if the two bromines are in a position that allows for the formation of a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a double elimination. Let me think: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, each Br could leave as Br^- and form a double bond, but wait, that might not directly form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Wait, no, Hofmann is for amines. Maybe it's more like the formation of an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that.

Wait, maybe the product is adamantanone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. If two adjacent Br atoms are removed, and perhaps an oxygen is inserted. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh! Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond, but if the structure allows for a conjugated diene or something that can further react to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the product has a 1H NMR. Let's look at the given data. The NMR peaks are: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a bit lower than a typical ketone (~1715 maybe?), but possible. Alternatively, it could be an ester or something else.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That could be an -OCH2O- group or maybe an -OCH2- group. But wait, 4.79 is probably a triplet, but the description says 4.79(2H), which is a singlet? Or maybe a doublet? No, the first part says 4.79(2H). The splitting isn't given, so perhaps it's a singlet.

Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group. Wait, if the product is a diketone, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about reaction mechanisms. When dihalides react with strong bases, they can eliminate to form alkenes. But in this case, perhaps a double elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl. Let me think: if two bromide groups are present on adjacent carbons, the base can abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces two eliminations, leading to a carbonyl group via some mechanism.

Wait, another idea: the reaction could be a one-step process where two bromide groups are eliminated with the formation of a carbonyl. Let me think of the mechanism. Suppose the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each bromide, leading to the simultaneous elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. No, that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to imagine the structure. Adamantane has a very rigid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons in a way that allows for elimination to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, when two adjacent Brs are present, the base could cause both to eliminate, forming a ketone. That makes sense. So, product 1 would be a ketone, specifically adamantanone, perhaps.

Wait, if so, the product would be 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think about the NMR. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Wait, if the product is a ketone, why are there other protons? Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone, but an epoxide or an ether?

Wait, maybe I should consider the product structure more carefully. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. However, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, not an -OH stretch, which would be around 3300 cm-1. So, the product has a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene that forms a carbonyl upon ozonolysis? No, that can't be because the product is formed before ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, but if elimination leads to a double bond, and then perhaps some rearrangement or oxidation occurs. But with KOH, it's more likely an elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is not a ketone but an ester. But how? Unless the KOH is acting in a way to form an ester, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Let me think about the reaction again. When a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone via a double elimination. For example, in the case of vicinal dihalides, sometimes two E2 eliminations can happen to form a carbonyl group. But wait, vicinal dihalides would be 1,2-dihalides. Here, the dihalide is 1,3, which is not vicinal. So perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for the two Br atoms to be on adjacent positions in a way that allows for a similar elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a carbonyl. So, for each Br, a H is abstracted, and the Br leaves, leading to a double bond between the two carbons. But wait, each elimination would form a double bond, so two Brs would lead to two double bonds? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in a way that when both are eliminated, a carbonyl is formed. Hmm, so maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons. But how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the two Br atoms are on the same carbon. No, because it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they're on different carbons.

Wait, another approach: the product's NMR. Let's break down the NMR data.

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield region, possibly an -OCH2- group. Since the IR has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester or ketone with an adjacent OCH2 group.

The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests some equivalent protons, perhaps in a cyclohexane ring. Adamantane has a lot of CH2 groups in rings, so maybe these are the ring protons.

1.94 ppm (2H) could be another set of CH2, maybe adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. If the product is a diol, the NMR would show OH groups, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, let's imagine the structure.

Wait, let's imagine that the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Then, the carbonyl would be at position 1, and the surrounding CH2 groups would be as per the structure. But the NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H). That doesn't fit with a ketone. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250 cm^-1, not 1720.

Another thought: could it be a geminal diol? No, because that would have OH groups, which would appear in the NMR as broad peaks, which aren't mentioned here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl with an adjacent ethylene group. Oh, wait, let's think about what happens when dihalides react with bases. If it's a 1,3-dibromo compound, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from one Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond, and then the other Br may do the same, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of a conjugated diene. No, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of possible structures. If the product has a carbonyl group, maybe the two bromine atoms are eliminated, and the two carbons that were attached to Br are now double-bonded and have an oxygen in between.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a ketone. For example, if the structure is like (CH2Br)2CO, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: the product's 1H NMR has a 2H singlet at 4.79 ppm. That could be an OCH2O group, like in a cyclic ether, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a β-keto ester or something similar. Wait, but I don't see any ester groups in the NMR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, a cyclohexanone derivative. But again, the NMR doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a ketone group. Let's say the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When eliminated, they form a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: the product could be an ester. But without an oxygen source, it's unclear. Maybe if the base somehow forms an alkoxide, which could then react.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to the formation of an alcohol and then oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, which then dehydrates to form a carbonyl. Wait, but geminal diols are more about forming a carbonyl, but in that case, the product would be the carbonyl, not the diol. So perhaps the first step forms a diol, but that's followed by something else. But the IR shows a carbonyl in product 1, so the diol would have to dehydrate, but that usually requires acid, not base.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should move to the next part and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl compound, which when treated with a Lewis acid could undergo some kind of cyclization or ring expansion.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some rearrangement. Another possibility is that product 1 is an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone is treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it's part of a Friedel-Crafts reaction, but adamantane is a saturated compound, so FC alkylation wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an enol ether or something that can undergo some kind of alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative. Wait, but I don't see any ethyl groups in the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step produces a diol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes dehydration to form an alkene. But then product 2 would have double bonds.

But maybe I should try to process the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone tends to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

Then, product 3's NMR is asked about, focusing on the most deshielded hydrogen. The options are about coupling patterns.

So, if product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, then it would likely have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative atom, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR for product 3 would then have protons near a carbonyl, such as in a ketone or aldehyde. But in the case of ozonolysis, aldehydes would form if the double bond was terminal. Alternatively, ketones would form if the double bond was internal.

But let's think about the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow, IR shows carbonyl)
2. product 1 + excess Al isopropoxide → product 2
3. product 2 + ozone → product 3

I think I need to figure out product 1 first.

Alternative approach: the product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H), which could be a -CH2-O- group, possibly as part of an ether or ester.

Wait, 4.79 is about where you'd see an -OCH2O- group. So if it's part of an epoxide, but then why the IR carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic carbonate or something else, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a ketone with an adjacent ethylene group. Wait, but in that case, the 4.79 would be a triplet for the ethylene protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol that dehydrates to form a carbonyl, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a dihydroxy compound, but then the IR isn't matching.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something similar, but that would require an -OH group, which would show up in the NMR as a broad peak, which isn't indicated here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the structures step by step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1.

The IR of product 1 has a strong carbonyl (1720 cm^-1), which suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid.

The NMR shows:

4.79 (2H) → possibly a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

2.41-2.23 (10H) → likely several equivalent CH2 groups in a ring structure, such as cyclohexane.

1.94 (2H) → perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to a functional group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then further reaction. Oh wait, KOH can also cause elimination, but in this case, perhaps it's a conjugated diene formation.

Wait, but the product's IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe the two bromides are eliminated, forming a double bond, and then some other process forms a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination could form a cyclohexenone?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a geminal dihalide elimination, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. Wait, but substitution would lead to a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination to form a carbonyl directly. Like, each Br is replaced by an OH, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. But that would require two eliminations, which would form a double bond but not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide. No, because that would require two oxygen insertions, which is unlikely with KOH.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the structure of product 1. Let's say it's a ketone. Suppose the product is adamantanone. Then, its structure would have a carbonyl group in the adamantane framework.

But then, the NMR would show the ring protons. Let me think about adamantane's structure. It's four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each ring has CH2 groups. If product 1 is adamantanone, then the ring protons would be in certain regions.

The NMR shows 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm. That's a lot of equivalent protons, perhaps in a single environment. So perhaps there are 10 equivalent H? Wait, each CH2 group has 2 H, so 5 CH2 groups would account for 10 H. Hmm, adamantane has several equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 2H at 4.79. If it's part of an ether group, like OCH2O, that could be a singlet if the CH2 is between two oxygen atoms and the protons are equivalent. Alternatively, in an ester group, perhaps.

But in that case, the IR would show a carbonyl from the ester. So maybe product 1 is an ester.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester with KOH? That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a β-keto ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Let me think: when two adjacent Brs are present, elimination can form a carbonyl group. So, the two Br atoms are on carbons that are both β to each other, allowing for the formation of a double bond and then a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me imagine that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Let's say it's part of a CH2O group.

The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) could be a set of CH2 groups in a rigid structure, perhaps in a cyclohexane ring.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2O group. But why would KOH produce that?

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonate? Not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic carbonate. How? 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo nucleophilic attack by OH- to form a cyclic carbonate, but I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide, but that seems unlikely with KOH.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Maybe I should move on and see if the later steps can shed some light.

Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But product 1 would need to be an aromatic compound for Friedel-Crafts, which adamantane isn't. So perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or another compound that can undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of acylium ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an ester (since it has a carbonyl and an OCH2 group). So, treating an ester with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of cyclization, like a lactone formation. But the structure would need to have an ester and a hydroxyl group for that, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol with a ketone group. But then, treating with Al isopropoxide might not do much.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ether with a ketone group. Then, Al isopropoxide could facilitate some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that would require an -OH group, which I'm not seeing in the NMR.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about product 2.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 likely contains a double bond, and when ozonolysis is performed, it breaks into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So, perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange) would be in a position where it's coupled to two or more other hydrogens.

Wait, when ozonolysis is done, it typically breaks a double bond into two carbonyl groups, so the resulting product would have carbonyl groups. If the original double bond was between two CH2 groups, the ozonolysis would cleave into two aldehydes. Or, if the double bond was between CH and CH2 groups, the products would be a ketone and an aldehyde.

But wait, if the double bond is symmetrical, like in a cyclopropane or something, the ozonolysis would yield two identical carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a ring, leading to a cyclic diketone after ozonolysis.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So, let me try to think about what product 2 could be.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an alkene formed by elimination after treatment with Al isopropoxide. Wait, no, because Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which could facilitate the formation of a double bond via elimination.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form a double bond.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or an alkene.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a cyclic ether with a ketone group (like a cyclic carbonate or something similar), then product 2 might be a ring-opened product, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a β-keto ester. Then, upon treatment with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it might undergo aldol condensation to form a conjugated enone, which is product 2.

If product 2 is an enone, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of an enone would produce a diketone, but depending on the structure, the cleavage would occur at the double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone (a conjugated dienone) would typically cleave the double bond, but I'm not exactly sure about the regiochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Let me think about the NMR after ozonolysis. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to it.

In the case of a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would have protons that are deshielded. Now, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

If the proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, it could be a triplet. Or, if it's next to a CH group, it could be a doublet.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)2CO. So, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me imagine a simple structure after ozonolysis. Suppose the original product 2 was a substituted cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would break the ring into two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming a diketone or a dialdehyde.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a simple alkene, like R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

But in our case, product 3's NMR is being considered. The most deshielded proton, perhaps in a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, if the structure is something like CH2(CO)-CH2-O-R, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs on each CH2, making it a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is in a CH group adjacent to a CH2, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is something like CH2=CH-R, after ozonolysis, it becomes O=CH-CHO-R or similar. Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, more accurately, ozonolysis of an internal double bond R1R2C=CR3R4 would form two carbonyl compounds: R1R2CO and R3R4CO.

If the original double bond is between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would yield two aldehydes: OHC-CH2-O-R and similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces a diketone, where each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group.

Let me think about the possible structure.

Suppose product 2 has a structure like CH2-CH2 as part of a ring. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, so the resulting product would have CH2 groups next to carbonyls.

So, the adjacent CH2 groups would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2-CO, then the CH2 group would have two protons each coupled to two others, making them triplets.

Wait, but the question asks about the most deshielded hydrogen. That would likely be the one closest to the carbonyl group.

In a typical structure like CH2(CO)-X, the CH2 protons would be next to the carbonyl and couple with their neighboring protons.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each proton would be split by two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each proton would be coupled to two others, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is in a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH is next to a CH2 group.

For example, consider a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-R.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, so if the original structure was CH2=CH-..., then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the structure could be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O= or similar, depending on the exact cleavage.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the possible splitting.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, then each H in the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same group, making them a quartet (if coupled with two neighboring Hs). But wait, that's for a CH2CH2 situation, like ethyl groups.

Wait, no. For a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, each H would be split by two Hs on the same group and one H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet of doublets or something more complex.

Wait, but the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each H would be a quartet. Or perhaps each H in the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to think about the overall process.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (likely a ketone, maybe adamantanone)
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (perhaps an alkene formed via elimination)
3. product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyl groups)

So, product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

If the original double bond in product 2 was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups. So, the product would have two CHO groups. The adjacent CH2 groups would each have two Hs, which would be split by neighboring Hs.

For example, if the structure after ozonolysis is OHC-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 group would have two Hs, each coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but in that structure, each CH2 is between two aldehyde groups. No, that's not possible because ozonolysis of a CH2=CH2 would give two formate groups, but that's a simple case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces a diketone. Let's say the original alkene in product 2 was part of a cyclopropane ring. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming a diketone.

In that case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two Hs, which would couple with each other, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the middle CH2 group would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Each H would be coupled with four Hs, leading to a pentet.

Wait, but that's getting a bit too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 next to the CO would have two Hs, each coupled with the two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be in that CH2 group, appearing as a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is adjacent to a CH2 group and another group with two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options don't have a triplet of triplets. Wait, no, option B is triplet of triplets.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two different sets of neighboring Hs, it could lead to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. However, I think the most likely scenario is that the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the options don't have a quartet. So, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH group, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is a triplet because each H is coupled with two others on the same CH2 and possibly one on an adjacent group, but that's getting complicated.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. If the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each H would couple with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Another possibility is that the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2, leading to more splitting. For example, if the structure is CH(CO)-CH2-CH3, then the CH would have coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

But in that case, it's a doublet of triplets if there's another coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H would couple with two Hs from the same CH2 and one H from the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, each H would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Thus, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, corresponding to option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a ketone.  
   - The ¹H NMR data for product 1 includes:  
     - 4.79 ppm (2H), likely a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).  
     - 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), likely equivalent CH₂ groups in a rigid adamantane framework.  
     - 1.94 ppm (2H), possibly a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.  
   - Based on this data, product 1 is likely adamantanone, a ketone formed via double dehydrohalogenation.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al isopropoxide**  
   - Product 1 (adamantanone) is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) through elimination, as Lewis acids can promote such reactions.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis at -78°C cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This CH₂ group is coupled to two equivalent protons on the same CH₂, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.  

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
