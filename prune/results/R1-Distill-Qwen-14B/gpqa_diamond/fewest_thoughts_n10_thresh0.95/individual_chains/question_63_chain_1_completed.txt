Okay, let me try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. So, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Hmm.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is probably the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But wait, when they talk about moving to the next state, I think they mean the next higher state, maybe a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question specifies that the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in the lowest possible vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But what's the next possible state in terms of energy?

I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But the next state could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Hmm, but the problem says the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think that implies the next state is the first excited state, which would be the first vibrational state (v=1), but wait, for a diatomic, the vibrational energy states are quantized, and the rotational are quantized as well.

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be approximated by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is E_rotational = B J (J + 1), where J is the rotational quantum number and B is the rotational constant.

In the fundamental state, v is 0 and J is 0. So E_fundamental = (0 + 1/2) ħω + B * 0*(0+1) = (1/2) ħω. The next possible state would be when either v increases to 1 (vibrational excitation) or J increases to 1 (rotational excitation). Since the question is about absorbing a photon, which has energy equal to the energy difference between the states.

Wait, but the photon's energy would match the difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is (v=0, J=0), and the final could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which suggests the photon's energy should be the minimum possible to cause a transition. Or maybe it's the first allowed transition.

Wait, but since the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next possible higher state would have either an increase in vibrational or rotational energy. Which one requires a lower energy photon? Because the vibrational energy depends on ω, which is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Let me calculate the energies. The vibrational energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vibrational = (1 + 1/2) ħω - (0 + 1/2) ħω = ħω.

The rotational energy for J=1 is B*(1)(2) = 2B. For J=0, it's 0. So the difference for rotational transition would be 2B - 0 = 2B. But what is B?

The rotational constant B is given by (ħ²)/(2I R²), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass. So first, I need to find μ.

The masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg. Then I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now B is ħ²/(2 I R²)? Wait, no. B is actually (ħ²)/(2 I R²) but wait, I think the formula is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but wait no, another approach. Let me think: the rotational energy levels are E = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And B is given by (ħ²)/(2 I c), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, B is defined as (ħ²)/(2 I c), but wait, no, perhaps B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but I might be mixing up different expressions. Alternatively, the rotational constant B is (h)/(8 π² c I), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach.

Wait, I think the rotational constant B can be expressed as B = (ħ²)/(2 I), but that can't be right because I is in kg m², and ħ has units J s. Let me think about the formula. The rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) J (J+1), which is the same as E_rot = B J (J+1), so B must be equal to (ħ²)/(2I). So B = (ħ²)/(2I).

Wait, actually, I think that's the case. So let me compute B.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * I )

We have I = 1.207e-46 kg m². So plug in the numbers:

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, and 1.05^2 is about 1.1025, so approx 1.112e-68 J² s²).

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that seems very small. Let me double-check the formula. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the formula for B.

Wait, another source says that B is given by (h²)/(8π² I c), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the rotational constant in spectroscopy. I think the rotational energy levels are given by E = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units (J), and B is calculated as (ħ²)/(2 I). So I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, let me compute B again. So B equals (h/(2π))^2/(2 I), because ħ is h/(2π). So ħ² is (h²)/(4 π²), so B = [ (h²)/(4 π²) ] / (2 I ) = h²/(8 π² I).

Ah, so the correct formula is B = h²/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. I used ħ²/(2I), but the correct formula is h²/(8 π² I) = ( (2 π ħ )^2 )/(8 π² I ) )  = (4 π² ħ² )/(8 π² I) ) = ( ħ² )/(2 I ), which brings me back to the same expression. So I think my initial calculation was correct.

Wait, but I'm getting B as 4.6e-23 J. Let me compute that again.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h^2 is (6.626e-34)^2 = (approx) 4.39e-67 J² s².

Then numerator is h^2 ≈ 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² I. I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

So denominator is 78.957 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 78.957 * 1.207 ≈ approx 95.4 → 95.4e-46 = 9.54e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 ≈ approximately 4.599e-23 J. So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ħ ω. Let's compute that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

The rotational energy difference for J=1 is 2B - 0 = 2B = 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller than ΔE_vib (4.218e-20 J is much larger than 9.2e-23 J). Wait, no: 4.2e-20 is larger than 9.2e-23? Wait, let's see: 4e-20 is 400e-22, and 9.2e-23 is 9.2e-23. Oh, so 4e-20 is bigger than 9e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon with the least energy needed would be the one causing a rotational transition, but wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the (v=0, J=0) state. The next possible higher state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The energy for (v=1, J=0): E = E_vibrational (v=1) + E_rotational (J=0) = (1 + 1/2) ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω. The energy for (v=0, J=1) is E = (1/2) ħω + 2B.

Which of these two is lower? Let's compute both.

E_vibrational (v=1) = (3/2) ħω ≈ (3/2)*1.05457e-34 *4e14 → (3/2)*4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

E_rotational (J=1) = 2B ≈ 2 *4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

So E_rotational is much lower. So if the molecule transitions to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is 9.2e-23 J, which is much lower than the vibrational transition. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy higher than the current state.

Wait, but the current state is (v=0, J=0), so the next possible state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has a lower energy.

Wait, but the energy of (v=0, J=1) is 9.2e-23 J, and (v=1, J=0) is 6.327e-20 J. So (v=0, J=1) is lower. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1). So the photon must provide the energy difference between (v=0, J=0) and (v=0, J=1), which is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the model allows for J to increase without v changing. I think that in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, and transitions can occur between rotational states without changing the vibrational state, but I'm not entirely certain about the selection rules. Wait, in the rigid rotor-vibration coupling model, the selection rules for rotational transitions are ΔJ = ±1, but for the vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. Oh, but in the case of a photon causing a transition, the photon's energy would have to match the energy difference between two states, which could be either rotational or vibrational.

But in this case, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that causes it to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the one with the smallest energy increase. That's the rotational transition, since 9.2e-23 J is much less than 6.3e-20 J.

So the energy of the photon should match the rotational transition energy, 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Then, the momentum p of the photon can be found using the relation E = p c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, photons have energy E = p c, where p is the momentum. So p = E / c.

So, plugging in the numbers, E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.067e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.067e-31 kg·m/s. But the options are given in N·s. Oh, because 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s. So 3.067e-31 N·s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1.1e-27, which is way bigger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, no, wait. The energy for the rotational transition is 2B, which I calculated as 9.2e-23 J. That would give p = 9.2e-23 / (3e8) ≈ 3.06e-31 N·s. But that's not any of the options. The options are in the 1e-27 to 2e-27 range.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let's recalculate B.

B = h²/(8 π² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * I.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / 22 ≈ 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2076e-46 ≈ 8 *9.8696 is about 78.957. 78.957 * 1.2076e-46 ≈ let me compute that: 78.957 * 1.2076 ≈ 95.4. So 95.4e-46 = 9.54e-45.

Now, B = (4.39e-67) / (9.54e-45) ≈ 4.599e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.198e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.198e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.198e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.066e-31 N s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 N s, which is 4 orders of magnitude higher. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should have calculated the vibrational energy instead. Because if the photon's energy is the vibrational transition, which is ħ ω.

Compute that:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

ω = 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p_photon = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 N s.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s. That's very close.

Wait, but earlier I thought the next state with the lowest energy would be the rotational transition (2B), but that gave a p of 3e-31 N s, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps the question intended for the transition to involve a vibrational change, but that seems contradictory. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking which transition is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't transition to a higher rotational state without a vibrational transition. Or perhaps the selection rules don't allow certain transitions. But I'm not sure about the specific selection rules for the rotation-vibration model. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition as the next state.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state is the one with the smallest energy higher than the current state. The current state is (v=0, J=0). The next possible states are (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1). The energies are:

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) ħω + 0 = (3/2)* ħω = 1.5 * 4.218e-20 J? Wait, no: ħω is 4.218e-20 J for v=1 compared to v=0? Wait, no, the vibrational energy for v=0 is (1/2) ħω, v=1 is (3/2) ħω, so the difference is ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

The rotational energy for J=1 is 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J.

But according to the options, that's not present. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition not just to the next state in either rotational or vibrational, but the next state in terms of combined quantum numbers.

Wait, the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are actually a combination of both. The energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. For the fundamental state, it's E_0 = (1/2) ħω + (1/2) (ħ²)/(2I) * 0 (since J=0). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by:

E = (v + 1/2) ħω + B J (J + 1),

where B is the rotational constant. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever has the lower energy.

Compute their energies:

For v=1, J=0: E = (1 + 1/2) ħω + 0 = 3/2 ħω ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

For v=0, J=1: E = (0 + 1/2) ħω + B*(1)(2) = (1/2) ħω + 2B ≈ 2.109e-20 J + 9.2e-23 J ≈ 2.118e-20 J.

Wait, that's lower than the vibrational transition. So the next state would be (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of energy 2B = 9.2e-23 J. So the momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.067e-31 Ns.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, which is (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon of energy ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because perhaps in the model, the rotational states are quantized and the vibrational energy is higher, so the next available state is the vibrational one, but that depends on the selection rules. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition that involves both a vibrational and rotational change, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the B calculation. Let me recheck.

I think I messed up B. Let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ R² = ( (20 * 2)/(22) ) * 1.66e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, wait, let me correct the calculation of μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So h²/(8 π² I) = (4.39e-67) / (8 * π² * 1.2076e-46) )

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

78.957 * 1.2076e-46 ≈ 78.957 * 1.2076 = approx 95.38 → 95.38e-46 = 9.538e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.538e-45 ≈ 4.599e-23 J, which is what I had before.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but the photon's momentum for this would be 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which would have an energy of ħω, so p_photon = ħω / c.

Compute that:

ħω = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) )= 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the next state, but I'm not entirely sure why the rotational transition isn't considered. Maybe in the context of the problem, the rotational transitions are not allowed, or the question is considering only the vibrational transition. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is considered as a rigid rotor and the vibrational transition is the only possible one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and not involving the vibrational energy, but that seems unlikely because the question mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps the term "fundamental state" refers to the state where both vibrational and rotational are at their lowest. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or higher rotational state. The energy required for the next state is the minimum of the two possible transitions.

But between 4.2e-20 J and 9.2e-23 J, 9.2e-23 J is smaller. So the photon should have energy 9.2e-23 J, but the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

So 1.4e-28 is option D, which comes from the vibrational transition.

Ah, perhaps the question is not considering rotational transitions and only vibrational. Or perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, which is the first possible higher state, regardless of rotational.

Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy", which would imply the transition with the least energy. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, why isn't that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem makes an approximation, such as treating the molecule as a rigid rotor and ignoring vibrational energy. But that doesn't fit the question's statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, I'm using B = h^2/(8 π^2 I). Alternatively, perhaps B is defined as (h^2)/(8 π^2 I c), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the units. B has units of energy (Joules). h^2/(8 π^2 I) → (J² s²) / (kg m²) → (kg² m^4/s²) ) / (kg m^2) ) → kg m²/s² → J. So yes, the units are correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Let me think of another approach. The rotational energy levels are given by E = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. Wait, no, that's when B is expressed in terms of spectroscopic terms. Alternatively, perhaps B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of frequency. Let me try another approach.

The rotational energy can also be expressed as E_rot = (ħ²)/(2 I) J (J+1).

So, for J=1, E_rot = ħ²/(2 I) * 2.

Which is E_rot = (ħ² * 2 ) / (2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So, for J=1, E_rot = ħ²/(I).

Compute that:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

I = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the photon's energy would be 9.21e-23 J, but that's not any of the options. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: maybe the question is referring to the rigid rotor model, not the rotation-vibration model. In the rigid rotor model, the molecule can't vibrate, so the only transitions are rotational. So the next state would be J=1, requiring E=2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, but again, that doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula for the rotational energy. Let me try to compute B as (ħ²)/(2 I).

Wait, if B = ħ²/(2 I), then B would be (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2076e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) = approx 4.6e-23 J, same as before.

Wait, but that doesn't change the outcome. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering the vibrational transition, which gives option D as the answer. Since option D matches the calculation for the vibrational photon energy.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the rotational and vibrational transitions.

   \]

2. **Bond length**:  
   \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   The moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational constant**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):  
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}}.
   \]  
   Compute \( h^2 \):  
   \[
   h^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2.
   \]  
   Compute \( 8 \pi^2 I \):  
   \[
   8 \pi^2 \approx 78.957, \quad 78.957 \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \approx 9.54 \times 10^{-45}.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   B \approx \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.54 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 4.607 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy difference for rotational transition**:  
   The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.607 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.214 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Energy difference for vibrational transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = (v + \frac{1}{2}) \hbar \omega \).  
   The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) and \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Photon momentum calculation**:  
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  

   - For the rotational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.214 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
     \]  
     This value does not match any of the given options.

   - For the vibrational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
     \]  
     This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the photon momentum required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. While the rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)), the options suggest the problem is considering the vibrational transition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
