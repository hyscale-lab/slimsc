Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I think I can figure this out by breaking it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I need to think about what happens when you dilute acetic acid with water. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so diluting it should increase its dissociation, making it a bit more ionized. But wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will be halved. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. The volume is in cm³, which is 20 mL, so 0.02 liters. Wait, wait, no. Oh, wait, no. Molarity is in mol/dm³, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 dm³. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 dm³) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 dm³. So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 dm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Adding same volume (20 cm³) of water, so total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That makes sense.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present.

So let me find the equivalence point first. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/dm³) = 0.01 dm³ = 10 cm³. So when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, that's the equivalence point.

But the problem is also asking about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, no. When you titrate, the amount of NaOH added is proportional to the progress of the reaction. So 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

Now, I need to calculate the pH at both these points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has reacted with NaOH. So the remaining moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of CH3COO^- produced are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the solution also includes the NaOH added. So the total volume at 25% titration is initial volume (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 dm³.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733 (since log(1.85e-5) is about -4.733, so pKa is 4.733).

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. That's approximately 4.26. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations. The ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3. So log(1/3) is indeed -0.477. So the pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So about 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, the first pH in option A is 4.26, which would fit. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. We also need to compute the equivalence point pH.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will be basic.

Wait, sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+) is the salt. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated. Moles of acetate at equivalence point: 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ (equivalence point volume) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 dm³.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced.

So,

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH near 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. After adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol of NaOH, yes. So all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate.

So moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation without the approximation.

Let me write Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me multiply both sides by (0.02 - x):

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

= 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula.

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

5.405e-10 squared is approx (5.405)^2 = 29.21, so 29.21e-20.

4ac is 4 *1 *1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11.

But 29.21e-20 is 2.921e-19, which is larger than 4.324e-11? No, 4.324e-11 is 4.324e-11 is 4.324 ×1e-11, which is 43.24 × 1e-12, while 2.921e-19 is way smaller. So the larger term is 4ac.

Wait, let me compute it precisely.

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared:

5.405e-10 = 5.405 ×1e-10.

(5.405)^2 = approx 29.214 → so (5.405e-10)^2 = 29.214e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

4ac is 4 * 1 * 1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So D = 2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11.

But 4.324e-11 is 43.24e-12, and 2.9214e-19 is much smaller. So D ≈4.324e-11.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because D is 2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11 + 2.9214e-19 ≈4.324e-11. So sqrt(D) is sqrt(4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324) × 1e-5.5.

Wait, sqrt(4.324) is approx 2.08. So sqrt(D) ≈2.08 × 1e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So 2.08 *3.16e-6 ≈6.58e-6.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 ±6.58e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root, so:

x ≈ ( -5.405e-10 +6.58e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.579e-6 ) / 2 ≈3.289e-6.

So x ≈3.289e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈5.48.

pH =14 -5.48=8.52.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approximation. So the pH at equivalence point is about 8.52.

But wait, the options say:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52.

So the first part is 4.26, the second is 8.52. Which matches my calculations. So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence point 8.52.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the equivalence point pH for a weak acid titrated with strong base is around 8.5 or so. Which is correct. For acetic acid, which has a pKa around 4.76, the equivalence point pH should be higher than 7. So 8.52 makes sense.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 25% titration calculation. Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log (n_A-/n_HA).

At 25% titration, I have 25% of the acid converted to A-. So n_A- is 0.25 * n_HA_initial, and n_HA is 0.75 * n_HA_initial.

So log(0.25 / 0.75) = log(1/3) = -0.477. So pH = pKa -0.477 = 4.733 -0.477 =4.256, which is about 4.26.

So that's correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 4.26;8.52.

Yes, that's our conclusion.

Wait, but the options also have option D:4.57;6.92 which is way off. So the correct answer is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.02 dm³) of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{dm}^3 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 dm³) of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 dm³), so the new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{dm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This converts 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate ions, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{dm}^3.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{dm}^3.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) ions at equilibrium. Using the approximation \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \), we solve:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is \( [\text{OH}^-] = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \), so the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, recalculating with the quadratic formula gives a slightly lower pH of approximately **8.52**.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** 4.26; 8.52  
- **B)** 3.17; 6.73  
- **C)** 4.73; 7.00  
- **D)** 4.57; 6.92  

The correct answer is **A**.
