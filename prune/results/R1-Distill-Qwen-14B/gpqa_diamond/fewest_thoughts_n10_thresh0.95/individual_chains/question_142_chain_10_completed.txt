Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think the question is asking where this particular ρ is located in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Let me recall: the Bloch vector (r) of a density matrix ρ is found by taking the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z).

So let's expand ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is a projector, and |1><1| is another projector. Adding them gives a matrix where the (0,0) and (1,1) elements are 1 each, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So when I multiply by 1/2, the diagonal elements become 1/2 each.

Wait, but I thought |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], so adding |1><1|, which is [[0,0],[0,1]], gives [[1,0],[0,1]] when added. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. Oh, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which doesn't have any coherence terms.

So going back to the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let me write out ρ as (I + r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]) / 2.

But in our case, ρ is diagonal: [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. Let's compare this with the expanded form.

Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2. I is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So adding I and r·σ gives [[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]].

Divided by 2, so the matrix ρ is [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ].

But in our case, ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So comparing the elements:

The (0,0) element is (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. So 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

The (1,1) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Which, since r_z is 0, that's correct.

Now, the off-diagonal elements: (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So both r_x and r_y must be zero because (r_x - i r_y) must be zero. The only way this holds is if r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but the options given are:

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct answer should be C) (0,0,0). That makes sense because the state is maximally mixed, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

I think that's right. Because for the maximally mixed state, the qubit is in a completely mixed state, so the Bloch vector is at the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) of a density matrix \( \rho \) can be extracted by comparing \( \rho \) to the general form:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the off-diagonal elements of \( \rho \) determine \( r_x \) and \( r_y \), while the diagonal elements determine \( r_z \).

For the given \( \rho \), it is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. Comparing this to the general form:

1. The diagonal elements give \( (1 + r_z)/2 = \frac{1}{2} \), which implies \( r_z = 0 \).
2. The off-diagonal elements give \( (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 \), which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state, which lies at the origin in qubit space.

The correct answer is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).**

Answer: C
