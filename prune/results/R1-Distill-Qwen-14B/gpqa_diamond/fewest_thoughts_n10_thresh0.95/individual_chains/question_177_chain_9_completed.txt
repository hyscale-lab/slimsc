Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right?

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, when it comes to luminosity, I think mass doesn't directly factor in. Oh wait, unless we're considering something like the mass-luminosity relation, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so probably we'll use the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's about the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's law, which states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max * T = constant (Wien's displacement law). So T1 = T2.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature? That's an important point. So now, the luminosity formula, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both are black bodies, that should apply.

So L1 = 4πR1²σT1⁴, and L2 = 4πR2²σT2⁴. But since T1 = T2, the T terms will be the same for both. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²)/(R2²). Because all the other terms (like 4πσ) are the same and cancel out.

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Oh wait, but wait a minute. The options are given, and option A is ~2.25, but another option is ~2.32. Hmm, why the discrepancy? Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem also mentions the radial velocities of the stars. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Wait, but earlier we were told that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh! Because of the Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is different.

Wait, so when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths have been adjusted due to their velocities.

Wait, let me think. The actual emitted wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, but when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the star with a higher velocity would have a different observed wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the stars' emitted wavelengths must have been adjusted by their velocities so that the observed λ_max are same.

Hmm, so for each star, the emitted λ_emitted is equal to λ_observed * (1 + radial velocity / c), depending on whether it's moving away or towards us.

Wait, but wait: the radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, because the radial velocity is positive. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would be longer (redshifted), while Star_1 has no shift.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Therefore, the emitted wavelengths must differ. Because when you have a redshift, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So for Star_2's observed λ_max to be the same as Star_1's, which is at λ_max, Star_2 must have emitted a shorter wavelength.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me denote:

For Star_1: Observed λ_max1 = λ_emit1 * (1 + v_r1 / c). But v_r1 is 0, so λ_max1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2: Observed λ_max2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2 / c). v_r2 is 700 km/s, so positive, so (1 + 700/c). 

But the problem says λ_max1 = λ_max2. So:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700/c )

Wait, no, wait. The observed λ_max is same for both. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 * (1 + v_r1/c) = λ_emit1 * 1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c) = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700/c).

Set equal:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700/c )

But λ_emit is determined by Wien's law: λ_emit = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

λ_emit1 = b / T1

λ_emit2 = b / T2

So, substituting into the previous equation:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + 700/c )

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + 700/c )

Rearranged:

T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/c )

Hmm, so T1 is less than T2 because denominator is greater than 1.

Wait, but wait, because Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So to make the observed wavelengths the same, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must have been shorter. Which means T2 is higher because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute (1 + 700/c ), where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is roughly 0.002333... So 1 + 0.002333 is approximately 1.002333.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 ≈ 0.99767 * T2.

Wait, but earlier when I thought T1 = T2, that was without considering the Doppler shift. So actually, T1 is slightly less than T2. So that changes the earlier calculation.

So, going back to the luminosity ratio. L =4πR²σT⁴.

So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T1)^4

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ (T2)^4

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Simplify:

(1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4

But T1 = T2 / (1.002333), so T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me compute 0.99767^4:

First, 0.99767 ≈ 1 - 0.00233.

We can approximate using the binomial expansion. (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² - ... for small x.

Here, x=0.00233, n=4.

(0.99767)^4 ≈ 1 -4*(0.00233) + (4*3/2)*(0.00233)^2 - (4*3*2/6)*(0.00233)^3 + ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: 1
Second term: -4*0.00233 = -0.00932
Third term: 6*(0.00233)^2 = 6*(0.00000543) ≈ 0.00003258
Fourth term: 4*(0.00233)^3 ≈ 4*(1.28e-8) ≈ 5.13e-8 (very small)
Fifth term: negligible.

So adding up:

1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068

Plus 0.00003258 → 0.99071258

Ignoring the fourth term, it's about 0.9907.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99767^2 first:

0.99767^2 = approx (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 = 0.99534 - 0.00000543 ≈ 0.99533457.

Then square that again:

(0.99533457)^2 ≈ Let me compute 0.99533^2.

Let me compute 99533 * 99533, but that's tedious. Alternatively, compute (1 - 0.00467)^2. Because 0.99533 is about 1 - 0.00467.

So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

x = 0.00467.

So 1 - 2*0.00467 + (0.00467)^2 = 1 - 0.00934 + 0.0000218 → 0.9906818.

So 0.99767^4 ≈ 0.99068.

So back to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.99068) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99068.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But since 0.99068 is a bit more than 0.99, let me compute more accurately.

2.25 * 0.99068 = ?

Break it down:

2 * 0.99068 = 1.98136

0.25 * 0.99068 = 0.24767

Add them: 1.98136 + 0.24767 = 2.22903.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without considering Doppler shift, the ratio was 2.25 (option A). But including the Doppler effect, which made the temperature ratio slightly less than 1, we get a lower ratio, about 2.23.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies and that their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T\), we conclude that the stars' temperatures must be adjusted for their radial velocities to ensure the observed wavelengths match.

### Step 1: Adjusting Temperatures for Doppler Shift
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), while Star_1 has \(v_r = 0 \, \text{km/s}\). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, we equate their emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), we find:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + v_r/c}
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), we calculate:

\[
1 + v_r/c = 1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 \approx \frac{T_2}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767 \cdot T_2
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{4\pi R_1^2 \sigma T_1^4}{4\pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

From the problem, \(R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2\), so:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Using \(T_1 \approx 0.99767 \cdot T_2\), we calculate:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the binomial expansion for small \(x = 0.00233\), we approximate:

\[
(1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x + 6x^2 - 4x^3 + x^4
\]

Substituting \(x = 0.00233\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) + 6(0.00233)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]
