Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Let's break down the problem.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, any star with V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning V magnitude ≤16 for detection.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Hmm. Oh, right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=17 is fainter than one with V=16. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17, while HIRES can see up to V=16. So a star needs to have V ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, but to be seen by both, it must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, brighter means lower magnitude. So if a star is brighter than V=17, meaning V<17, then ESPRESSO can observe it. And for HIRES, stars brighter than V=16 can be observed. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V magnitude ≤16. So, V ≤16.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So I think that means V <17. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So, V <17 is brighter than 17. So stars with V magnitude less than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning V <16.

Wait, no. Wait, the term is "brighter than 17 mag" — does that mean apparent magnitude is less than 17? Because in magnitudes, lower is brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so both can see it. But a star with V=17 is fainter than 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it. So for a star to be seen by both, it must have V ≤16.

Wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can
