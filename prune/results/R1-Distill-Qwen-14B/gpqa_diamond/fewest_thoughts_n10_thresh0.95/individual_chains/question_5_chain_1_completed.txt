Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provide the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator along direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, let me think about how operators and eigenvectors work in quantum mechanics. The operator in question here must be the component of the angular momentum operator along the direction n. Because the eigenvalue is ħ/2, that suggests it's a spin-1/2 system, like an electron or a muon. So muon's spin is 1/2, so the eigenvalues for the spin component along any direction are ±ħ/2.

Oh, right, so the operator P is actually the spin operator, probably S, but they're denoting it as P here. So the problem is about finding the eigenvector of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Now, the direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector has components (nx, 0, nz). So, the operator P should be the spin component along this direction. The operator for spin along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the spin vector operator and the direction vector. So, P = n · S = nx Sx + nz Sz. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or 180 maybe? Or wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is zero. Because x-z plane is θ measured from the z-axis, and φ is 0. So, the direction can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, no, because usually spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis. So, if I have a vector in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P would be the spin component along this direction. So P = n · S = sinθ Sx + cosθ Sz.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator is given by the components Px, Py, Pz. So, each component is a matrix. So, P is a vector operator, and the actual operator along direction n would be a linear combination of Px, Py, Pz.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator P is given as having components Px, Py, Pz. So, the operator along n is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, the operator becomes P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So, the eigenvalue equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Hmm, but wait, usually the spin operator S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalue is ħ/2, so the operator must be along direction n, and the state |ψ> is an eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The problem is to find the eigenvector. So, perhaps I can construct the matrix for P and then find its eigenvector.

First, let me write down the given components:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, let's denote each component without the ħ/2 factor for simplicity. Let me define:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P_x = (ħ/2) σx, etc.

But the operator along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, P = (n_x σx + n_z σz) * (ħ/2).

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So,

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = [ ( (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> ) ] = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but wait, the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz), and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2). So,

(ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz) has eigenvalues 1. So, we're looking for eigenvectors of the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz, where M |ψ> = |ψ>.

Alternatively, the equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So, the eigenvector must satisfy (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

So, let's write out M:

M = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Which is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

Because adding the two matrices:

- The (1,1) element is 0 from σx and n_z from σz, so n_z.
- (1,2) is n_x *1 from σx.
- (2,1) is n_x *1 from σx.
- (2,2) is -n_z from σz.

So, M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Then, M - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

We can set up the equation (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

Let the eigenvector be |ψ> = [a, b]^T.

So,

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

So, two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can solve for a and b in terms of each other. Let's take equation 1:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But since we have two equations, let's see if they are consistent. Let me substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Substituting into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Let me compute each term:

First term: n_x * (-n_x)/(n_z -1) * b = (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) b

Second term: (-n_z -1) b

So,

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate the denominator:

[ -n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ] b = 0

Wait, because [ (-n_x^2) + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ) ] * (n_z -1) ?

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute:

Wait, equation 2 after substitution:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → [ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

So,

[ (-n_x^2) + ( -n_z -1 ) (n_z -1) ] / (n_z -1) ) * b = 0

Wait, no, actually:

Wait the equation is:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0.

So, to combine the terms, find a common denominator.

Multiply the second term by (n_z -1)/(n_z -1):

[ (-n_x^2) + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ] / (n_z -1) ) = 0

So numerator must be zero:

-n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Let me compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):

= (-n_z)(n_z) + (-n_z)(-1) + (-1)(n_z) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z^2 + n_z -n_z +1
= -n_z^2 + 0 +1
= 1 - n_z^2

So, the numerator equation is:

- n_x^2 + (1 - n_z^2) ) = 0 → 1 - (n_x^2 + n_z^2) ) = 0 → But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So 1 -1 =0, so the equation is satisfied. Therefore, the two equations are consistent and we have a nontrivial solution.

So, from equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But let's think about this. We can write a in terms of b.

Let me denote the parameter as a ratio. Let me choose b as a parameter, say, b = 1.

Then, a = -n_x / (n_z -1 )

But wait, let's see if this makes sense. Let's express this ratio in terms of θ, as n is in the x-z plane.

Since n is in the x-z plane, and it's a unit vector, let me parametrize n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then in x-z, the x component is sinθ, z is cosθ.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting into a:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2 )

Numerator: -sinθ = -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )

So,

a = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )) ) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] b

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels:

= [ (sinθ/2 cosθ/2) ) / ( sin²θ/2 ) ) ] b = [ cosθ/2 / sinθ/2 ] b = cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So, the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

But we can choose b=1 for simplicity, so the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

Wait, but let's check the normalization. The eigenvector must be normalized.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cotθ/2|^2 + 1^2.

But cotθ/2 is cosθ/2 / sinθ/2.

So, |cotθ/2|^2 = cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)

So, the norm squared is [ cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2) ) + 1 ] = [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin²θ/2 ) ] = 1/sin²θ/2.

So, normalization factor is sinθ/2.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cotθ/2, 1 ] multiplied by sinθ/2.

So,

a = cotθ/2 * sinθ/2 = [ cosθ/2 / sinθ/2 ] * sinθ/2 = cosθ/2

b = 1 * sinθ/2 = sinθ/2

Wait, that simplifies nicely. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ]

Wait, but wait, I have to account for the phase. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D has some hbar terms and square roots.

Wait, but the options given don't have θ in them except for options B, C, and D. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ )

B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, from our calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C matches this. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, wait, let me check again. Because in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So that would match option C.

But wait another thing. The original operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, when theta is the angle from the z-axis, maybe the muon's spin state is along n, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But let me think about possible global phase factors. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector can be multiplied by any complex phase. In our calculation, the components were real, but in some cases, there could be an i involved.

Wait, let me think about it. The eigenstate [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is for spin-up along the x-z direction, but let me consider the rotation.

Wait, another approach: think about the eigenstates of S·n. The eigenstates are |+> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] and |-> = e^{i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, which would imply that phi is zero. Because phi is the angle around the z-axis, right? So, if n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{-i phi/2} is 1. So, the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So that looks like option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have. So, would the answer be option C?

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because S·n is the operator, right? And in the case where n is along the z-axis (theta=0), the eigenvectors should be |up> and |down>. Let's test this case.

If theta=0, then n is along the z-axis. So the eigenstate should be [0,1], because spin-up along z is [0,1], and spin-down is [1,0].

Wait, in our result, when theta=0, cos(theta/2) = cos(0) =1, sin(theta/2)=0. So, the state would be [1, 0], which is spin-up along x. Hmm, that's not correct. Because when n is along z, the eigenstate should be |up_z> = [0,1].

Wait, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because according to our previous calculation, when theta is 0, the state is [1,0], which is along x.

But that's incorrect because when the operator is along z, the eigenstates are the standard |up> and |down> in z.

So, where did I go wrong?

Ah! Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization of n.

Wait, when theta is the angle from the z-axis, the x component is sin(theta) * cos(phi), and the z component is cos(theta). But since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So, the direction n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

Wait, but in that case, when theta is zero, n is along z: (0,0,1). So, our operator is along z, right? So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are the standard |up_z> and |down_z>.

But according to our previous result, when theta=0, the state is [ cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0 ] → [1,0], which is the |up_x> state, which is correct for theta=90 degrees, not theta=0.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps I messed up the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization should be in terms of the angle from the x-axis? Because perhaps I got the angle the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps when theta is the angle from the z-axis, the eigenstate for spin-up along n is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ] multiplied by some phase.

Wait, let me re-examine the eigenstate calculation.

Let me go back to the original equations. So, M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], and M |ψ> = |ψ>.

We found that the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But when theta=0, n is along z, so n_z=1, n_x=0.

So, M becomes [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, no, because M is n_z σz + n_x σx. So when n_z =1, n_x=0, M = σz.

So, the eigenvalue equation becomes (σz - I)|ψ> =0.

σz - I is [[0,0], [0,-2]]

So, the equation is 0*a + 0*b =0,

0*a -2 b =0 → b=0.

So, a can be arbitrary, so the eigenvector is [a, 0], which is proportional to [1,0]. But according to our earlier expression, when theta=0, cos(theta/2)=1, sin(theta/2)=0, so [1,0], which is correct. But earlier I thought that when n is along z, the spin-up state is [0,1], which is not the case here.

Wait, wait a second. No, when n is along z, the eigenstates are |up> = [0,1] and |down> = [1,0]. Because S_z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, so the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to |up> which is [0,1].

But according to our calculation, when n is along z (theta=0), the eigenvector is [1,0], which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. Because the operator is S·n, and n is along z. So, [1,0] is spin down along z.

Wait, so that's correct. Because the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2, the state [1,0] is spin down, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. So there's a mistake here.

So, our calculation gives the state [1,0], but that's for eigenvalue -ħ/2. But the question asks for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, perhaps I should have considered (M + I)|ψ> = 0.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +1 when multiplied by (ħ/2), so the equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz)|ψ> = (1)|ψ>.

Wait, no, wait: the equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ> → (n_x σx + n_z σz - I)|ψ> = 0.

So, the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz - I.

Which is:

[[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

Wait, but earlier, when n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), M becomes [[0,0],[0,-2]], leading to the equation 0*a -2b =0 → b=0. So, the eigenvector is [a,0], which corresponds to eigenvalue +1, which would be +ħ/2 when multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so [1,0] is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue +1, which would correspond to eigenvalue ħ/2 when multiplied by (ħ/2).

So that's correct. Because when n is along z, the state [1,0] is the |down> state, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. Wait, no. Wait, the operator is n·S, which when n is along z, the operator is S_z. So S_z |up> = +ħ/2 |up>, and S_z |down> = -ħ/2 |down>.

So, the eigenvector [1,0] is |down>, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. But in our equation, when M is applied, it's M = S·n / (ħ/2), so M |down> = ( -1 ) |down>, so M |down> = |down> → eigenvalue is -1, which when multiplied by (ħ/2) gives -ħ/2. But the problem states the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we need the eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 in M.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think again:

The operator in question is (n_x S_x + n_z S_z ) = n · S.

We're looking for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is: n · S |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

The matrix for n · S is (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz )

So, the equation becomes (n_x σx + n_z σz ) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Which is, as before, (n_x σx + n_z σz - I ) |ψ> = 0.

So, the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz - I.

When n is along z, M is [[0,0],[0,-2]], so the only solution is [1,0], which is |down> state. Which has eigenvalue -1 for M, and eigenvalue -ħ/2 for the operator.

But the problem asks for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, this suggests that perhaps the calculation is for the eigenvalue -1, but that's not what we want.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck.

Wait, when n is along z, the operator is S_z. The eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |up> = [0,1].

Let me plug into the equation M |up> = ?

M = [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

n_z=1, n_x=0 → M = [[0,0], [0,-2]]

So, M |up> = [0, -2*1] = [0, -2], which is -2 |up> → eigenvalue -2. So, this gives (n · S) |up> = (ħ/2) * (M) |up> → (ħ/2)*(-2) |up> = -ħ |up> → which contradicts the expected eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz, not subtracted I.

Wait, in this case, the equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>, because the operator is (n · S) = (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz ). So, (n · S) |ψ> = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So, (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix M is (n_x σx + n_z σz ), and the equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, M - I = [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ].

So, the eigenvalue is +1, leading to the eigenvector [ a, b ].

Wait, now when n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), M is [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σz.

M |up> = [0, -1] [0,1] = [0, -1], which is -|up>, so M |up> = -|up>, so M |up> = (-1)|up>, which implies that (n · S) |up> = (-1)(ħ/2)|up> → eigenvalue is -ħ/2. But the problem asks for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, when n is along z, the state with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |down> = [1,0].

Plugging into M, M |down> = [[1,0],[0,-1]] [1,0] = [1,0] → M |down> = |down>, so eigenvalue 1. So, (n · S) |down> = (ħ/2)|down>, so eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Ah, okay, so the correct state for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the state [1,0] when n is along z.

Similarly, when n is along x (theta=90 degrees), n_x=1, n_z=0, M is [[ -1, 1], [1, 1 ].

Wait, no, M would be [[ 0, 1 ], [1, 0 ]], because n_z=0, n_x=1.

So M = σx.

The eigenstates of σx are [1,1]/√2 and [1,-1]/√2. So, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So, the state [1,1]/√2 is the eigenstate with eigenvalue +1, which would correspond to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for n · S.

But according to our previous result, when theta=90 degrees, the state is [cos(45), sin(45)] = [√2/2, √2/2], which is [1,1]/√2. So that's correct.

So, when theta=90 degrees, the state is (1,1)/√2, which is the eigenstate of σx with eigenvalue +1.

But when n is along z (theta=0), the state is [1,0], which is the |down> state, but for the operator S_z, the |down> state has eigenvalue -ħ/2. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, for n along z, the state [1,0] is an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 for M, leading to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator.

Wait, but in reality, S_z |down> = -ħ/2 |down>, which would mean that (n · S) |down> = -ħ/2 |down>, which is the opposite of what we have.

Hmm, this is confusing. So perhaps I have a sign error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz, without subtracting I.

When n is along z, M = σz.

σz |down> = [[1,0],[0,-1]] [1,0]^T = [1,0] → 1*1 +0*0 = 1.

Wait, no, wait: σz |down> is [[1,0],[0,-1]]* [1,0]^T = [1, 0], which is |down>, so eigenvalue is +1. So (n · S) |down> = (ħ/2) * (+1) |down> → eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But in reality, S_z |down> = (-ħ/2)|down>.

So this suggests a discrepancy. So perhaps the parametrization is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction of the vector n is being considered as opposite. Because when n is along z, the state [1,0] is |down> and has eigenvalue -ħ/2. But in our earlier calculation, the state [1,0] is the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2, which would imply that the direction is opposite.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the eigenvalue equation as (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (+1) |ψ>, leading to M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, when n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), M is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So,

M |ψ> = |ψ> → [1,0; 0,-1] |a; b> = [a; -b ] = [a; b ]

Which gives equations:

a = a → always true.

-b = b → b=0.

So, the state is [a, 0], which is |down> state. And this state has eigenvalue +1, implying that (n · S) |down> = (ħ/2) (n · S) |down> = (ħ/2)(+1) |down> → which would imply that S_z |down> = +ħ/2 |down>, which is incorrect. Because S_z |down> = -ħ/2 |down>.

So, that suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to find the eigenstate with eigenvalue -1 for M, which would then correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for the operator.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the eigenvalue equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have set M |ψ> = -|ψ>, leading to eigenvalue -1 for M, which when multiplied by (ħ/2) gives eigenvalue -ħ/2, which isn't what we want.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach. Let me think about the general case.

The eigenvector of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is given by the state |+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But since our direction n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But let me check this. For n along z (theta=0), this gives [1,0], which is the |down> state, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2, not +ħ/2. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the phase is e^{i phi/2}. Let me think again. The general eigenstate for spin-1/2 along (theta, phi) is |+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But when phi=0, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, when theta=0, it's [1,0], which is |down> along z, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. So, that doesn't fit.

But the question asks for the state with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, I must have made a mistake in the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct state is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) e^{i phi} ].

Wait, perhaps I should think about the eigenstates in terms of the spherical basis. The standard eigenstates for S·n are:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

|-> = e^{i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]

So, for phi=0 (n in x-z plane), |+> is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which, for theta=0, is [1, 0], but that gives eigenvalue -ħ/2 when n is along z.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps I should have taken the other eigenvalue. Maybe I should have set up the eigenvalue equation as (n · S) |ψ> = (-ħ/2) |ψ>, but the problem states it's +ħ/2.

I must be missing something here.

Let me approach it differently. Let's consider that the operator P is the spin operator along n, and we're looking for the state with eigenvalue +1/2 in units of ħ.

So, the eigenstate is |+> which can be written as |+> = [ a, b ]^T.

The eigenvalue equation is (n_x S_x + n_z S_z) |+> = (1/2) ħ |+>

But in matrix terms, without the ħ/2 factor, this becomes (n_x σx + n_z σz) |+> = |+>

So,

n_x [ [0,1],[1,0] ] + n_z [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.

Which is the same equation as before.

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a,

n_x a - n_z b = b.

Rearranged:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0.

From the first equation, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Substitute into the second equation:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] - (n_z +1) b = 0.

Which simplifies to:

[ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) - (n_z +1) ] b = 0.

As before, this leads to the same condition, given that n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So, we proceed to find a in terms of b. Again, a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

But when n is along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), a = [0/(0)] b, which is undefined. So, perhaps we need to approach this limit separately.

When n_z=1, the operator becomes σz, so the eigenstates are |up> (eigenvalue +1) and |down> (eigenvalue -1). So, the state |down> is [1, 0], which has eigenvalue +1 for M, leading to eigenvalue +1/2 when considering units. But that's not correct because S_z |down> = -ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the operator in terms of σ and the actual eigenvalues. Let me think in terms of the matrix.

When n is along z, the matrix for n·S is (ħ/2) σz. So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenstate |up> for σz is [0,1], which gives (ħ/2)(1) = +ħ/2. So, the state [0,1] is the correct eigenstate for +ħ/2 when n is along z.

But according to our general solution, when n is along z, the state should be [1,0], which is |down> and has eigenvalue -ħ/2. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the solution approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when setting up the eigenvalue equation. Let me double-check. The operator is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but perhaps the correct equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (+1) |ψ>, leading to eigenvalue +1, which when multiplied by (ħ/2) gives +ħ/2.

So, when n is along z, n_x=0, n_z=1.

The matrix becomes [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

M |ψ> = |ψ> → [[1,0],[0,-1]] [a,b]^T = [a, -b] = [a, b]

So, this gives:

a = a → always true.

-b = b → implies b=0.

So, the state is [a, 0], which is [1,0], which is the |down> state.

But (n · S) |down> = (ħ/2) (M) |down> = (ħ/2) [1,0] → eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But in reality, S_z |down> = -ħ/2 |down>, which suggests a contradiction.

Wait, this means that our earlier calculation is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = -|ψ>, leading to eigenvalue -1, which when multiplied by (ħ/2) gives -ħ/2.

But the problem states eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so this can't be right.

Hmm. This is getting quite tangled. Maybe I should consider another approach.

The eigenstates of S·n for spin-1/2 are given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

|-> = e^{i phi/2} [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]

Since we're in the x-z plane, phi=0. So,

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

|-> = [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]

So, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to |+>, which is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But when theta=0,

|+> = [1, 0], which should correspond to the state with eigenvalue +ħ/2 when n is along z.

But wait, when n is along z, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [0,1]. So this suggests a problem with the parametrization.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the angle theta is measured from the negative z-axis. So, when theta is 0, the direction is along the negative z-axis.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's see:

If n is along the positive z-axis, theta = pi.

Then, theta/2 = pi/2, so cos(theta/2) = 0, sin(theta/2) = 1. So, |+> = [0,1], which is correct.

Similarly, when theta=pi/2 (n along x), theta/2=pi/4. So, |+> = [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] = [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct.

So, perhaps the parametrization uses theta measured from the positive z-axis towards the x-z plane, but in the opposite direction. So, the correct general form is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] where theta is the angle from the positive z-axis, but when theta is 0, n is along the negative z-axis.

Wait, that would mean that when the direction is along the positive z-axis, the angle theta is pi. So,

|+> = [ cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2) ] = [0,1], which is correct.

But in the problem statement, the direction is in the x-z plane, so theta can be from 0 to pi.

So, this suggests that the correct eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] where theta is measured from the positive z-axis.

In that case, when n is along the positive z-axis (theta=pi), the state is [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1], which is correct.

But this would imply that in our earlier calculation, the parametrization was wrong, and theta is measured from the positive z-axis.

So, in that case, the correct normalized eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which matches option C.

But the problem is that when we calculated earlier, the state [1,0] corresponds to n along the negative z-axis.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, when theta is the angle from the positive z-axis, the normalized eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, considering that, the correct answer would be option C.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our conclusion.

Wait, but what about the normalization? In our earlier calculation, the state was normalized, as the norm is sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) = 1.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But why are the other options present? For instance, option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the direction. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the direction is in the x-z plane, but not necessarily the positive x-z plane. So, when n is in the x-z plane, it can have components in x and z, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

But in our solution, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], where theta is the angle from the positive z-axis towards the x direction.

So, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another angle. Let me take theta=180 degrees (pi radians), so n is along the negative z-axis. Then, the state is [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1], which is the |up> state, which has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So that's correct.

But when n is along the positive z-axis (theta=0), the state is [1,0], which is |down>, which has eigenvalue -ħ/2. But the problem asks for eigenvalue +ħ/2, so that suggests that when n is along the positive z-axis, the correct state would be [0,1], which would correspond to theta=pi in the parametrization.

So, this supports that the correct parametrization is using theta as the angle from the positive z-axis, but the state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Thus, the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the positive z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**: The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the Pauli matrices, the operator becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
   \]

3. **Matrix Form**: Writing the operator in matrix form:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The eigenvalue equation becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Solving for Eigenvector**: Subtracting the identity matrix:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   From the first row:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
   \]
   Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:
   \[
   a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
   \]

5. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cot(\theta/2) \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Normalizing this vector:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \sin(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos(\theta/2) \\
   \sin(\theta/2)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos(\theta/2) \\
   \sin(\theta/2)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary constants and factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This form is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces incorrect normalization factors and unnecessary constants.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
