Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance d for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters. Wait, the formula I'm trying to recall is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with angles?), no, wait. Oh right! For a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral is a bit different.

Rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal (a = b = c) but the angles α, β, γ are not necessarily 90 degrees. So the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system must take into account the angles. The general formula for d is... I think it's d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) or something along those lines.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me try to get this right. The formula for d in terms of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right! The general formula when the unit cell isn't cubic is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² + ... some terms involving cosines of the angles )

But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I think the formula involves the reciprocal of the dot product of the plane vectors. Another approach might be to use the structure factor formula, but that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, but the angles between them are the same (α = β = γ = 30 degrees in this case). So maybe I can use a simplified version of the interplanar distance formula.

The formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, but what is θ here? Oh right, because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all equal. So each pair of axes (a, b), (b, c), (c, a) has the same angle, which in this case is 30 degrees.

Wait no, wait. The angles α, β, γ are the angles between the edges. So α is the angle between a and b, β between b and c, and γ between c and a. But in a rhombohedral system, α = β = γ = 30°, so each is 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2(1*1 cos α + 1*1 cos β + 1*1 cos γ) )

Since α = β = γ = 30°, each cos term is cos(30°).

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos 30° )).

Wait, wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the sum of h² + k² + l²:
1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the other terms: 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)
Since h=k=l=1, and all angles are 30°, this becomes 2*( (1*1 cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) )
That is 2*(3 * cos30°) = 6 cos30°.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30°).

What's the value of cos30°? That's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * cos30 = 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

Then, 3 +5.196 = 8.196.

So the square root of that is sqrt(8.196) ≈ let's compute that.

Wait sqrt(8) is 2.828, sqrt(9) is 3. So sqrt(8.196) is a bit more than 2.86.

Wait, let me compute 2.86 squared: 2.86 * 2.86 = 8.1796. Hmm, that's close to 8.196.

Wait, 2.86^2 = 8.1796. 8.196 is a bit higher. Let's try 2.862^2:

2.862 *2.862 = ?

Well, 2.86^2 is 8.1796.

0.002 more: So (2.86 + 0.002)^2 = 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 8.1796 + 0.01144 + 0.000004 = approx 8.191044.

But 8.196 is higher than that. So maybe 2.862^2 is 8.191, and 2.863^2 is 2.862^2 + 2*2.862*0.001 + (0.001)^2 ≈ 8.191 + 0.005724 + 0.000001 ≈ 8.196725. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.862 + 0.001*(8.196-8.191)/ (2*2.862) ), but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's just say approximately 2.862.

Wait, wait, perhaps a more precise approach. Let me compute 2.862^2 = (2.86 + 0.002)^2.

I can calculate 2.862 * 2.862:

= (2.86 * 2.86) + (2.86 * 0.002) * 2 + (0.002)^2.

Wait, 2.86 * 2.86 = 8.1796.

Then, 2.86 * 0.002 = 0.00572, multiplied by 2 gives 0.01144.

0.002^2 is 0.000004.

So total is 8.1796 + 0.01144 + 0.000004 = 8.191044.

So 2.862^2 = 8.191044. Hmm, but we have 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 6*(0.8660254) = 3 + 5.1961524 = 8.1961524.

So sqrt(8.1961524) is approximately 2.8625, maybe 2.8625.

So 1 divided by 2.8625 is approximately 0.349.

Wait, but wait, the interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstroms. So d = a / denominator = 10 / 2.8625 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms?

Wait that can't be right. Because the interplanar distance is usually shorter than the interatomic distance, but 3.49 is about a third of 10. But looking at the options, the smallest is 8.95, which is less than 10. So wait, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 h k cos γ + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos α )

But because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, and the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

But since all angles are 30 degrees, and the terms are 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos 30°, the denominator becomes:

sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, wait, 2 (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) = 6, multiplied by cos30, which is sqrt(3)/2.

So 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.8625.

Then d = 10 / 2.8625 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms.

Wait, but the options are all around 9-10 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake. Oh wait, no, wait, no, no wait. Wait, wait, what's the interatomic distance? Oh, in the question, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in crystallography, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the lattice parameter a (the unit cell edge length) with the interatomic distance.

Wait, no, wait. In a crystal, the interatomic distance is usually the distance between nearest neighboring atoms. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1 = a, because atoms are at the corners. But in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2, etc.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states: "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So if it's a simple cubic structure, a would be 10. But in a rhombohedral structure, the situation is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong to use a=10. Maybe that's the interatomic distance along one direction, but in reality, for a rhombohedral system, the unit cell's a is not necessarily the same as the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again.
