Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. Hmm, Michael addition reactions involve enolates attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, so the nucleophile, which would be the enolate, attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Let's look at each part one by one.

First reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good donor, so it's probably the nucleophile here. But wait, NaOEt is a strong base, so it deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form the enolate. The enolate would then attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait, no: the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Or wait, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- ester. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl is on C3, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 group. Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So in the case of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOR? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C-O-R, and the p-tolyl is attached to the CH2 group. So, the structure is CH2(p-tolyl)CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the Michael addition. The enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester, CH2(CO2Me)2. When it's deprotonated, the enolate is strong, and attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in the first reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the acrylate has the structure CH2
