Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. A pure state would have a density matrix where the square of the eigenvalues equals the eigenvalues, but this looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of |0> and |1> projectors each multiplied by 1/2. So this must be a completely mixed state for a qubit.

Wait, what's the structure of the density matrix for a qubit? A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is 2x2. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are elements. For a pure state, like |ψ><ψ|, the matrix would have rank 1, but this matrix looks like it's diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. So the eigenvalues are 1/2 and 1/2, which sums to 1, so it's a valid density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh, right! The Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a vector on the surface of the sphere. For a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector is represented as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So for a state ρ, the Bloch vector components are x = <σ_x>, y = <σ_y>, z = <σ_z>, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, another approach: the general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be expressed as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So when you expand that, each component of r corresponds to the expectation values.

So let's calculate. Let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write |0> as [1; 0] and |1> as [0;1]. Then |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I is the identity matrix, and (I)/2 would have diagonal elements 1/2 each, and off-diagonal zero. So yes, that's ρ. So ρ = I/2.

Now, express ρ as (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute that. The identity matrix is I, and r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So (I + r·σ)/2 becomes:

(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
           [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

But our ρ is (I)/2, which is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So comparing the two expressions, the off-diagonal terms must be zero. So:

(ρ)_{12} = (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0
(ρ)_{21} = (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0

Which implies that r_x and r_y must both be zero. Because for the off-diagonal to be zero, r_x - i r_y must be zero. That would require both components to be zero because the only way both real and imaginary parts are zero is if each part is zero. So r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Now the diagonal elements must be 1/2. So:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That's the origin, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. All possible states have equal probability, so it's as if the state is undefined—completely mixed.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, as it is a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) with equal probabilities. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, where \( x = \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), \( y = \langle \sigma_y \rangle \), and \( z = \langle \sigma_z \rangle \).

For the given density matrix, we compare it to the general form of a qubit density matrix in Bloch sphere terms:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix must be zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms yield \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This result is consistent with the state being completely mixed, as it has no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \)**  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \)**  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \)**  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \)**  

The correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
