Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right?

So the given data: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance... is that the same as the lattice parameter 'a'? Because in a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', but in other structures, it might vary. Or maybe in this case, since it's a rhombohedral crystal with all angles equal to 30 degrees, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms. I think that's how it works.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are the same length 'a', and all the angles between the edges are equal. So that's why it's called rhombohedral.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameter and some factors from the Miller indices and the angles.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit different from the cubic case. In the cubic case, it's straightforward, like d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But since this is rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic? Or is it a separate system? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Oh, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait no, I think in the classification, the cubic system includes simple cubic, BCC, FCC, and rhombohedral is a different system where a = b = c but angles are not 90 degrees. Oh, I might be mixing up some details.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal can be found using the formula derived from the lattice parameters. For a general rhombohedral system, the formula for d(hkl) is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not exactly correct. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square of the sum of the squares of the structure factors, considering the lattice angles.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula:

d(hkl) = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula that for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha = beta = gamma, the interplanar distance can be calculated using:

d² = a² [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ]^(-1)

Wait, that might be the case. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between all axes are the same, so for any pair of axes, the cosine terms will be the same. So, for (hkl) = (111), let's compute that.

Wait, so the formula would be:

d² = [ a² ( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) ]^(-1 )

So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1, and gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait, in some sources, I think the formula might have a sum of (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha). But in rhombohedral, all angles are same, so that reduces to 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma, but wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. Because each of the terms in the sum is hk cos gamma, hl cos gamma, and kl cos gamma, but wait, no, let's see.

Wait wait, in the general case, the formula for 1/d² is [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2( hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ) ] divided by a².

But in rhombohedral, all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So, the expression becomes:

1/(d²) = [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2( hk cos g + hl cos b + kl cos a ) ] / a²

But since a = b = c and cos a = cos b = cos g, this becomes:

1/(d²) = [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2( hk + hl + kl ) cos gamma ] / a²

So for (111) plane:

h = k = l = 1.

So:

sum = (1+1+1) + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30°)

sum = 3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2 )

Because cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2.

So 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3)

Compute that. Let me calculate:

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 3 + 3*(1.732) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / a².

But a is 10 Angstrom, so a² is 100.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 = 0.08196.

So d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.203.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1/d² = (3 + 3√3) / (a²) → 3(1 + √3)/(a²).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let's recheck the sum.

Wait, the sum inside the brackets is (h² +k² +l²) + 2( hk cos g + hl cos b + kl cos a )

In this case, h=k=l=1, so:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

Then, for 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma:

Each term is 1*1, so three terms, sum is 3, multiplied by 2 gives 6, multiplied by cos(30) → 6*(√3/2) = 3√3.

So sum is 3 + 3√3.

Wait, so 3 + 3√3 is approximately 3 + 5.196=8.196.

Wait, but 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3+5.196=8.196.

So the sum is 8.196.

So 1/d² = (8.196) / (10)^2 = 8.196 / 100 = 0.08196.

Therefore, d² = 1/0.08196 ≈ 12.203.

So d is sqrt(12.203) ≈ 3.491 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 8-10 Angstroms. Oh wait wait, wait a second... Wait, no, wait. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, no. Because I thought the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( ... ), but perhaps I inverted it.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = [ (a² ( h² + k² + l² ) + 2a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a²) )

Wait, that would be:

d = 1 / sqrt( [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] / a² )

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Oh! Because the denominator under the square root is the sum divided by a², so the a comes out as sqrt(a²) → a.

So, in this case:

d = a / sqrt( sum )

sum is 3 + 3√3 as before.

So sum is 3 + 3*1.732 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are in 8-10 range, so I must have something wrong.

Wait, that can't be. Because the interplanar distance can't be smaller than the interatomic distance. Wait, actually, the interplanar distance for (100) plane in a cubic system is a, and for (111) it's a/sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Angstroms for a=10. So 3.49 is even smaller, but that doesn't make sense since the options are bigger.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Maybe the formula should be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors and calculate the interplanar distance using vector methods.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, all with the same length a, and the angles between each pair are gamma (30 degrees).

The reciprocal lattice vectors are required for the Miller indices. Wait, maybe I should use the reciprocal lattice approach.

Wait, the plane (hkl) corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this reciprocal vector divided by the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell V is a^3 multiplied by sqrt(1 - 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma + cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma), but perhaps for a rhombohedral system, it's a^3 times sqrt(1 - 2 cos^3 gamma + cos^2 gamma (1 + 2 cos^2 gamma) )? Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the volume can be calculated as a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2 cos α cos β cos γ - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos² α cos² β + 2 cos² α cos² gamma + 2 cos² beta cos² gamma) )? Wait, maybe no, perhaps for rhombohedral where a = b = c, and angles all same, the volume simplifies.

Wait, perhaps the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 2 cos^3 gamma + cos^2 gamma (1 + 2 cos gamma)) ? Or is there a simpler way.

Wait, I think for a rhombohedral system, the volume is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma). Hmm, not sure, but perhaps I can look for another approach.

Another approach: The interplanar distance d(hkl) can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, because all angles are gamma. So the formula simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos gamma + 2kl cos gamma )

Which can be factored as:

d = a / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos gamma) )

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, expanding the terms:

Wait, for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos gamma )

Because 1²+1²+1²=3, and the cross terms are 2*(1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos gamma) = 6 cos gamma.

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos gamma )

Wait, cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 3 + 6 * 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Thus, d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But wait, the options are all above 8 Angstrom, so this can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong approach.

Wait, but I've heard that the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But wait, in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so: d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2[ hk cos(gamma) + hl cos(gamma) + kl cos(gamma) ] )

Which is the same as:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 cos(gamma) (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So h² +k² +l² = 3.

hk + hl + kl = 3.

So:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2 * cos(30) * 3 )

Which is:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos(30) )

As before, which gives d ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all higher than 8. So there's a contradiction here. So perhaps I misunderstood the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is different from 'a'. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Hmm, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a'. But in other structures, like BCC or FCC, 'a' is smaller than the atomic radius times 2.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps each atom is at the corner of the cube and one in the center? No, that's BCC. Or maybe it's a face-centered structure? No, rhombohedral is a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps in this question, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between nearest neighbors. So in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'. Because in a simple cube, the nearest neighbors are along the cube edges, so distance 'a'. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then 'a' is 10.

So why are the options so much larger? Perhaps I'm using the reciprocal formula incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, the plane (hkl) has a normal vector with components h, k, l in reciprocal space. The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector multiplied by the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a^2) ) )

Wait, that's the same as what I had before. So perhaps I'm not making a mistake in the formula, but I'm getting a result that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the formula. Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, no, no, that would give a smaller d. But the options are all bigger than 8, which is larger than a=10. So that can't be.

Wait, oh! Wait. Maybe the question is about the interplanar spacing in a different system, like hexagonal, but no, the system is rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recompute.

Wait, for (111):

sum = 3 + 6 * cos(30) = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms.

But that's way less than any option. The options are around 8-10. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the interatomic distance as the distance between two adjacent planes, but that's not correct. Or maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, another formula I found online is: d = a / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]^0.5

But that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different.

Wait, maybe the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk (1 + cos gamma) )

Wait, no, that's not correct, because that would only account for two of the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. Let's model the lattice vectors.

The rhombohedral unit cell has vectors a, b, c, each of length a, with angles between a and b as gamma, between a and c as gamma, and between b and c as gamma.

The (111) plane has normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance d is the distance between two adjacent planes, which is the same as the magnitude of the projection of the unit vector in the direction of (1,1,1) onto the unit cell vectors.

Alternatively, the formula for d is given by:

d = 1 / [ ( (h a) · (h a) + (k b) · (k b) + (l c) · (l c) ) + 2 (h k a · b + h l a · c + k l b · c) ) ]^(1/2)

But that seems complicated. Let me compute each term.

The vectors a, b, c each have magnitude a=10.

The dot product a·b = a b cos gamma = a^2 cos gamma.

Similarly, a·c = a^2 cos gamma, and b·c = a^2 cos gamma.

So, for the (111) plane, the numerator is:

h a + k b + l c = a + b + c.

The squared magnitude of this vector is:

|a + b + c|² = a² + b² + c² + 2(a·b + a·c + b·c)

Which is:

a² + a² + a² + 2( a² cos gamma + a² cos gamma + a² cos gamma )

= 3a² + 2*3 a² cos gamma

= 3a² (1 + 2 cos gamma )

Wait, so |a + b + c|² = 3a² (1 + 2 cos gamma )

Thus, the magnitude is |a + b + c| = a sqrt(3 (1 + 2 cos gamma) )

But the interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of this magnitude, scaled by something?

Wait, no. Because the distance between two planes can be found by projecting the unit vector in the direction of (1,1,1) onto the unit cell. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector (h a + k b + l c) divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + ... )

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d can be found by:

d = | a + b + c | / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos gamma + 2 kl cos gamma )

Wait, that would be:

d = [ a sqrt(3(1 + 2 cos gamma) ) ] / sqrt(3 + 6 cos gamma )

Wait, because the numerator is |a + b + c| = a * sqrt( 3(1 + 2 cos gamma) )

Wait, let's compute that.

So,

d = [ a * sqrt(3(1 + 2 cos gamma)) ] / sqrt(3 + 6 cos gamma )

But 3 + 6 cos gamma is 3(1 + 2 cos gamma). So sqrt(3 +6 cos gamma) = sqrt(3 (1 + 2 cos gamma) ) ).

So,

d = [ a * sqrt(3 (1 + 2 cos gamma)) ) ] / [ sqrt(3 (1 + 2 cos gamma)) ) ]

Which simplifies to a.

Wait, that's interesting. So d = a.

Wait, that can't be right because when (hkl)=(111), the interplanar distance would be a=10, which matches one of the options (option D is 10.05), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, but according to this calculation, d = a. So for (111) plane in this rhombohedral system, d = 10 Angstrom.

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in a simple cubic structure, (111) plane has d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Angstrom. So how come in this case it's a?

Hmm, perhaps this approach is wrong. Maybe I should go back to the formula.

The formula from crystallography is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a²)

But in rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, so:

1/d² = [h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos g + 2 hl cos g + 2 kl cos g ] / a²

So,

1/d² = [ (h +k + l)^2 - (hk + hl + kl) (2 - 2 cos g) ] / a²

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's plug in h=k=l=1.

Sum = 3 + 6 cos 30.

Which is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 5.196 ≈8.196.

So,

1/d² =8.196 / (10)^2 → 0.08196.

Thus, d = sqrt(1/0.08196) ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but 'a' is different.

Wait, wait. In a rhombohedral structure, if the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance) is 'd_nn', and 'a' is the lattice parameter, then for a simple cubic structure, d_nn = a.

But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance might be different.

Wait, perhaps 'a' is the interatomic distance. Or perhaps 'a' is the nearest neighbor distance.

No, the question says, interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this crystal, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstrom. So 'a' is the lattice parameter, which is the edge length of the rhombohedral unit cell.

Wait, but the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral system can be found by the minimal distance between any two lattice points. So perhaps the nearest neighbor is along the (1,1,0) direction, or another direction.

Wait, it's getting complicated. But perhaps to solve the problem, I should proceed with the formula I've used previously, even though the result doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look up the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Upon checking, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

But wait, that would be the same as I have.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos 30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula uses 2( hk cos gamma ) but in a different way. Let me think: perhaps the formula is squared sum plus 2( hk cos gamma + ... )

Wait, the correct formula, according to my notes, is:

d^2 = a^2 [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) ]^(-1)

So,

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which is what I did. So for (111), that gives 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is that the formula I'm using is correct for the hexagonal system, not rhombohedral.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a form of hexagonal? Or is it a form of cubic.

Wait, the seven crystal systems are:

1. Triclinic
2. Monoclinic
3. Orthorhombic
4. Tetragonal
5. Trigonal (same as rhombohedral)
6. Hexagonal
7. Cubic.

Wait, so rhombohedral is same as trigonal. So perhaps the formula I'm using is for hexagonal, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the hexagonal crystal formula instead.

In hexagonal systems, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (4/3) [ (h² + k² + l²) - (h + k + l)(h +k +l -3) ] / (a^2)

Wait, no, perhaps that's for the Miller indices in hexagonal systems. Alternatively, the formula for hexagonal is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the trigonal and hexagonal systems. Because rhombohedral is the same as trigonal, they share similar formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + hk + hl + kl )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

Let me compute that.

Given a=10, gamma=30 degrees.

Compute volume V:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

Compute cos(30) ≈ 0.866.

So,

1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3

Compute each term:

0.866^2 ≈0.75, 0.866^3≈0.75 *0.866≈0.6495.

So,

1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) =1 -2.25 + 1.299 = (1 -2.25)= -1.25 +1.299 ≈0.049.

So,

V ≈10^3 * sqrt(0.049)≈1000 * 0.221≈221.

But how does this help me? Because the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by d = (a) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]^0.5.

Wait, but in our case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6 * cos30 )

Which again comes to approximately 3.49 Angstrom.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that 'a' is 10.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstrom, but 'a' is different.

So, in a simple cubic, 'a' is the nearest neighbor distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would be along a different direction, perhaps.

Wait, let me think: in a rhombohedral structure with a=10, and gamma=30 degrees, what is the nearest neighbor distance?

Wait, the rhombohedral structure can be considered as a cube stretched and skewed such that all edges are the same length and all angles are equal. The nearest neighbor would be along the (1,1,1) direction perhaps?

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the nearest neighbor could be along (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc., but given the angles, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is a=10. But the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a a cos gamma ) → sqrt( 100 +100 + 200 * cos 30 )

Wait, wait, no, wait, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0) in rhombohedral coordinates is a + b.

The distance squared is |a + b|² = a² + b² + 2 a b cos gamma.

Since a = b =10, gamma=30,

Distance squared = 100 +100 + 2*10*10 * cos 30 = 200 + 200 * (sqrt(3)/2 )= 200 +100*1.732≈200+173.2=373.2

So distance ≈ sqrt(373.2)≈19.31 Angstrom.

Wait, that's way larger than 10, so the nearest neighbor is not along (1,1,0).

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along (1,1,1) direction.

Wait, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in rhombohedral coordinates is a + b + c.

The magnitude squared is |a +b +c|² = a² +b² +c² + 2( a·b + a·c + b·c )

Each a·b = a b cos gamma =10*10 * cos30 ≈ 100 * 0.866≈86.6.

So,

|a +b +c|^2 = 100 +100 +100 + 2(86.6 + 86.6 +86.6 )

=300 + 2*(259.8)=300 +519.6=819.6.

So |a +b +c|=sqrt(819.6)≈28.63 Angstrom. Which is even larger. So maybe the nearest neighbor is along (1,0,0), which is 10 Angstrom.

But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 10, which would imply that along the edges, the distance is 10 Angstrom. So 'a' is 10.

So perhaps my initial approach is correct, but the options don't match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check a different approach.

I recall that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So for (111), it's a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77.

But in a rhombohedral system, the formula accounts for the angles between the axes. So the distance should be larger than in the cubic case if the angles are smaller than 90 degrees, because the axes are closer together.

Wait, in this case, gamma is 30 degrees. So the angle between the axes is smaller than 90, meaning the vectors are closer together, so the interplanar distance should be larger than the cubic case.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 3.49, which is smaller than 5.77. So that can't be. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d(hkl) = [ (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)) + 2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]^(-1/2)

So, for (111), this becomes:

d = [ a²(3) + 2a² (3 * cos gamma) ]^(-1/2 )

= a [ 3 + 6 cos gamma ]^(-1/2 )

Which is the same as before.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 ) ≈10/(2.863)≈3.49.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps the question is not about (111) but about (100) or another plane.

Wait, no, the question is about (111). So perhaps the formula is incorrect, and I should consider that the sum is (h² +k² +l²) + 2( hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ), but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's (h² +k² +l²) + 2( hk + hl + kl ) cos gamma.

But that's what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2( hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ) )

Wait, that would make the denominator smaller, leading to a larger d. Let's try that.

For (111):

sum = 3 -6 * cos gamma.

cos30≈0.866.

sum=3 -6 *0.866=3-5.196≈-2.196.

So sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2( hk cos (180 - gamma) + ... ) )

But cos(150) is negative, which might change the sum.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

In my earlier calculation using the formula, I get 3.49, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Calculate using the volume.

The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma) )

So,

V=10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

We computed earlier that 1-3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495) = 1-2.25 +1.299 = approx 0.049.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈1000 *0.221=221.

The reciprocal of the volume is 1/221≈0.00452.

The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a^2) )

Which brings us back to the same formula as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos gamma )

Wait, but that's the same as before.

So, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vector for (111), which is (h, k, l) = (1,1,1), and then calculate its magnitude.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l), and their magnitude is sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but in reciprocal space, the magnitude is:

|G| = sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk cos(gamma) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(alpha) ) )

Which is the same as earlier. So,

|G|=sqrt(3 +6 * cos30 )≈sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

Then, d= 1/ ( |G| / a )

Wait, no. Because the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, scaled by the volume.

Wait, the formula is d = 1 / ( |G| * (V)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, I think I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = (a) / |G|,

where |G| is the magnitude of the reciprocal vector.

But since |G|=2.863,

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect for this problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / [ (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) ]

Which for (111) would be:

d=10 / (3 + 3) = 10/6≈1.666 Angstrom. Even more off.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But in that case,

sum =3 -6 cos30≈3 -5.196≈-2.196.

Negative under the square root. Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'll take a different approach. Maybe the question refers to the lattice parameter 'a' as the interplanar distance for (100) plane. Because in a cubic system, (100) plane has d=a. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, perhaps the (100) plane has d=10. But the question is about (111).

Wait, but the question says interatomic distance is 10, so perhaps 'a' is 10.

Wait, since none of the options match my calculation, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) )

Which would give:

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6 )= imaginary. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - gamma) )

Because angles in crystallography are measured between the vectors, which could be in a different direction.

Wait, gamma is 30 degrees, so 180-30=150 degrees. Cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

So,

sum =3 -6*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(8.196 )≈3.49.

Same result as before.

I'm stuck. All my approaches lead to 3.49, but the options are much larger. So perhaps the problem is in the formula, or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 ( hk + hl + kl ) (1 - cos gamma )

Wait, let me try that.

sum =3 + 2*3*(1 - cos30 )

=3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3+6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

d=10 / sqrt(3.804 )≈10/1.95≈5.12 Angstrom.

Still no match with the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) (1 - cos gamma ) ) / a².

So,

sum =3 +6*(1 - 0.866)=3+0.804=3.804.

1/d²=3.804/100=0.03804.

d= sqrt(1/0.03804 )≈sqrt(26.28)≈5.128 Angstrom.

Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps it's time to look for another approach. Let me think about the lattice parameters and the interplanar distance formula in terms of the basis vectors.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is the reciprocal of the length of the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l) multiplied by the volume of the unit cell.

The reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l) has magnitude:

|G| = sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

So, for (111):

|G|=sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )≈2.863.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

As computed earlier, V≈221.

So the interplanar distance d is:

d= (2V)^{1/3} / |G|

Wait, no, I think the formula is d = 1/( |G| * (V)^{1/3} )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. The correct formula is:

d = 1 / ( |G| )

But scaled by the volume.

Alternatively, the general formula is:

d = 1 / ( |G| ) * (V)^(1/3)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Which is what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, as it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me compute 3 +6 * cos30 again.

cos30=√3/2≈0.8660.

6 * cos30=5.196.

3 +5.196=8.196.

Square root of 8.196 is approx 2.863.

So 10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the interplanar distance is calculated using the inverse of the formula, i.e., 1/d = ... instead of d = ... So perhaps I should invert the result.

Wait, that would make d=2.863, which is even smaller. Doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos( gamma ), but with gamma being 150 degrees, not 30.

Wait, let's test that. Cos(150)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

So,

sum=3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196≈-2.196.

Negative inside the square root, which is impossible. So no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles. In some definitions, the angle gamma is the angle between a and b, but in others, it's between a and c. Or perhaps it's the angle between b and c.

Wait, in the standard definition for a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha is between b and c, beta between a and c, and gamma between a and b.

But I'm not sure if that affects the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use cos(180 - gamma), but earlier that didn't help.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to proceed with the formula I have, but since it doesn't match the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A)9.08.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos gamma) )

So,

sum=3 +6*(1 - 0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

d=10/sqrt(3.804)=10/1.95≈5.128.

No, that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos gamma) )

sum=3 -6*(0.134)=3-0.804=2.196.

d=10/sqrt(2.196)≈10/1.48≈6.757.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos gamma) )

Which would be:

sum=3 +6*(1.866)=3 +11.196=14.196.

d=10/sqrt(14.196)=10/3.77≈2.65.

No, that's worse.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I'll proceed with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula uses the square of the sum, not the square root.

Wait, no, the formula is 1/d² = (sum)/(a²).

So,

sum=8.196.

1/d²=8.196/100=0.08196.

d²=12.203 → d≈3.49.

No, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) / a².

Which would be:

sum=3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95. Let's see what sum would that require.

If d=8.95,

sum= a²/(d²) = (10^2)/(8.95^2 )=100/(80.1025)=1.248.

So,

sum=3 +6 cos(gamma) =1.248 → 6 cos(gamma)= -1.752 → cos(gamma)= -0.292.

Gamma would be about 106 degrees, which doesn't match the given 30 degrees.

So that can't be.

Alternatively, if d=9.08,

sum=100/(9.08^2 )=100/82.446≈1.213.

3 +6 cos(gamma)=1.213 →6 cos(gamma)= -1.787 → cos(gamma)= -0.297. Again, gamma would be around 107 degrees.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's 1/d² = ( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) ) / (a² (1 + cos gamma) )

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the Miller indices and the interplanar distance in terms of the basis vectors.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1) in reciprocal space.

The reciprocal lattice vector is given by:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*

Where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors can be expressed in terms of the original basis vectors.

But I'm not sure about the exact relations.

Alternatively, the magnitude of G is:

|G|² = h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha.

Which is the same as before.

So,

|G|=sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

The interplanar distance d is 2π / |G|, but that's for the reciprocal space. Wait, no, in reciprocal space, d is 1/|G| multiplied by the volume.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( sum ) )

Which is what I've been calculating.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, I'll recheck my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, 3 +6 * cos30.

Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 *0.8660=5.196.

3 +5.196=8.196.

Square root of 8.196 is approximately 2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But since the options are around 9, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt( ... )

But that would change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

Which would be:

d=10 * sqrt(3 -6 *0.866)=10*sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) → imaginary.

No.

Alternatively,

d = a * sqrt( sum )

Wait, that would give d=10 *2.863≈28.63, which is larger than any options.

No.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. The only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which for (111):

sum=3-6 *0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(8.196 )=10 *2.863≈28.63, which is not an option.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would give 10*sqrt(3)/sqrt(8.196)=10*(1.732)/2.863≈10*0.605≈6.05.

Still no match.

At this point, I must concede that I'm unable to find an approach that matches the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how that would fit.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the cosine term
\[
\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Final calculation for \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are in the range of 8.95 to 10.05 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or a misinterpretation of the problem. However, based on the standard formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, the result remains \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \).

### Conclusion
Despite multiple attempts to verify the calculations and explore alternative approaches, the result consistently yields \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), which does not align with the given options. Given the constraints of the problem, the closest plausible answer is **B) 8.95 Å**, though this does not reconcile with the derived formula.

Answer: B
