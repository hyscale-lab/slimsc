Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember each spectrograph has different brightness limits. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, brighter than, meaning less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Because anything brighter (smaller magnitude number) is detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag or lower. So, a star needs to have V mag ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and V mag ≤16 to be seen by HIRES. But since the question is asking which stars can be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because the question is about being detectable by both. So, the apparent V magnitude must be within the range that both can detect. So, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So, only stars with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both. Because if a star is 16.5 mag, HIRES won't see it, but ESPRESSO can. But for both, it has to be ≤16.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up. Let me re-read the question. It says, which stars can be detected with both. So, the star must be detectable by both instruments. So, the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES). So, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16. So, any star that has apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but another thing: some of the stars have absolute magnitudes, and others have apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for those that have absolute magnitude given, considering distance and interstellar extinction (dust reddening), which affects apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star one by
