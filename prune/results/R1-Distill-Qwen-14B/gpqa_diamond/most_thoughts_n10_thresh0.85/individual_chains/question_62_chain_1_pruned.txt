Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule. It seems like it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. Oh wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Let me parse the name again. 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same as the aldehyde group being on C-1. So, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no. Wait. The substituent is on the cyclohexane. Let me imagine the structure. So, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1. Then, attached to position 1 is a hydroxymethyl group, which is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is: cyclohexane ring, with a CH(OH)-CH2-cyclohexyl group connected to the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane. The substituent is at position 1. So, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the substituent is a methyl group (-CH2-) attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 1. That methyl group has a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group attached to it. So, the structure is:

Cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1. Wait, no. Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (CHO) at position 1. Then, substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. Wait, that can't be right because the aldehyde is at 1. So, maybe the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group, and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon. So, the same carbon (the 1-position) has both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. Wait, but that would mean the same carbon can't have both. Oh, wait, maybe it's more like the substituent is a CH2 group where one of the H's is replaced by a hydroxyl and another by
