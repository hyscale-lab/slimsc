Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says it's a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max. Oh, and they're considering relativity here, so the speed of light c must play a role.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium point (x=0) and is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m) * A, I think. But wait, no, actually, the maximum speed formula from simple harmonic motion is v = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. Oh right, ω is sqrt(k/m), so v_max is sqrt(k/m)*A. So that's the non-relativistic case.

But this is a relativistic harmonic oscillator. So I must consider special relativity effects. So the problem probably involves using the relativistic expressions for energy or momentum.

In special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, maybe the energy expressions change.

Wait, but if it's a relativistic oscillator, perhaps the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² anymore. Or maybe the force law still holds but with relativistic momentum considerations.

Alternatively, the system could be treated using relativistic energy equations. In SHM, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the force F is given by F = -k x, but in relativity, F = d(p)/dt, where p is the relativistic momentum, which is gamma m v. So maybe I should set up the equation of motion in terms of relativistic momentum.

The equation would be F = d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think about energy.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the potential and kinetic energies are treated differently.

Wait, another approach: for a harmonic oscillator, when the system is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential. At x=0, the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. So maybe in the relativistic case, the energies are modified.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2) m v_max² = (1/2)k A². So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, which is non-relativistic, but the problem is relativistic, so I guess that's not the correct answer.

So in the relativistic scenario, perhaps the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², but something else. The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0,
