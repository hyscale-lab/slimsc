Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The name is a bit complex. Let's parse it. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. Then, at position 1 (which is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a substituent—a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with a CHO, and on the same carbon as the CHO, there's a CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe the structure is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl attached to the aldehyde. Let me draw it mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane, and at position 1 (if the aldehyde is at position 1?), there's a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane ring and an OH group. Or wait, maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, but I might need to visualize this better.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is the starting material. Ethynyl is an alkyne group, so it's a cyclohexane with an ethynyl substituent. The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps oxidation is involved? But wait, how would we get from an alkyne to an aldehyde?

Let me think about the possible reactions. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. To get an aldehyde, maybe we can introduce a carbonyl group. But alkyne to aldehyde requires some steps. One method is to perform hydration of the alkyne to a ketone, then further reaction. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, right? So maybe we can add H2O with certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: using a Grignard reagent or perhaps a hydroboration? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol via some process, but that doesn't directly lead to aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a bromide. Oh wait, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. If we treat it with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that's an alkylation. Oh wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. But ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons adjacent to the triple bond. So NaNH2 could deprotonate it, making an alkyne anion, which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in an alkylation. So that would add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring. Deprotonating would give a cyclohexyl-CH-⁻-C≡CH. Then methyl chloride would add a methyl to the triple bond, but wait, doesn't that make it CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH3? Or maybe substituting the proton with methyl? Let me think: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives CH2-C≡C⁻. Adding CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-CH3 and Cl⁻. But that would make a longer alkyne? Wait, no, the alkyne would now be CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's 1-pentyne or something? Wait, no, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH, so deprotonation would give cyclohexyl-CH-C≡C⁻. Then adding methyl chloride would lead to cyclohexyl-CH(CH3)-C≡C⁻, but that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl to the triple bond, so the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that would be a substituted ethynyl group. So after alkylation, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, perhaps not. Another thought: maybe the alkylation is adding a methyl group via the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-ethyl group with triple bond) is treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl. This could be a deprotonation followed
