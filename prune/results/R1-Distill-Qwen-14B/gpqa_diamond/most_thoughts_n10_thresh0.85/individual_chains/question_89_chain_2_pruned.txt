Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane skeleton.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, it's usually an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, since it's a vicinal dihalide? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal. Oh wait, in adamantane, the positions might be such that when the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but considering the structure, maybe it's possible for elimination to form a bridge or a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to form an epoxide? No, wait, KOH in such conditions would more likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, but with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I remember that when vicinal dihalides react with KOH, they can form alkenes. But if it's not vicinal, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on positions that are not adjacent, so elimination may not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbene? No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a ring-opening if the structure is a strained ring. Wait, or perhaps the reaction is an example of dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond. But for that, the dihalide needs to be vicinal. Since the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another possibility: Could it be a Hofmann elimination? But Hofmann usually involves amines. Oh wait, maybe the base is causing elimination leading to a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with excess KOH, perhaps a double substitution occurs. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would typically undergo elimination if possible. Oh, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other bridgeheads. So maybe the two Brs are on two adjacent bridgeheads, making the molecule a vicinal dibromide in a bridge structure. That would make elimination possible, forming a bridgehead double bond. That would form an adamantene structure. Oh right, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, it undergoes elimination to form 1,3-adamantadiene, which is also called diamondene. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that usually comes from a cyclic ether. Alternatively, the product might be a ketone.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So if the initial product has a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but oxidation or maybe a substitution leading to a ketone.

Wait, but KOH is a base and not an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a double elimination forming an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides form from vicinal dihalides with something like NaOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution to form a diol, but that would have OH protons. But the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Maybe an ether? Or an epoxide. Wait, but if it's an epoxide, the protons would be around 3-4 ppm, I think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so the product must have a carbonyl group. So maybe the initial step forms a ketone. How would that happen? If the dihalide is treated with a strong base, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation followed by some other process. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that involves coupling two aryl halides with Na. Not likely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is being treated with a base in a way that leads to a geminal diol, but I don't think that's the case because that would require a dihalide on the same carbon. Wait, another angle: when vicinal dihalides react with a base, like aqueous KOH, they form alkenes. But if the dihalide is not vicinal, perhaps it doesn't eliminate, but maybe the base does something else.

Wait another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is a double substitution, but how would that form a carbonyl? Oh wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH and undergoes a double elimination, leading to a carbene intermediate, which is then trapped to form a carbonyl. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a substitution to form a diol, but then the diol is oxidized. But then, under what conditions? KOH is a base, not an oxidizer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the formation of an epoxide. Wait, no, because that would need a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch, which would be expected in an epoxide if it's opened, but the question states it's a solid product, maybe an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, could form an enol, which would tautomerize to a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-type elimination, but that involves vicinal diols. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the IR data: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So how to form a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbene, which then forms a ketone. But I'm not certain about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then some further reaction. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, not a C=C. So maybe elimination is followed by some addition or oxidation, but KOH isn't oxidizing.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the base induces the formation of a ketone via elimination. Wait, if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons and eliminate both, perhaps you form a double bond. But wait, that wouldn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: The 1H NMR of product 1 shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's around the region where CH2 groups attached to oxygen show up, like an OCH2. For example, in epoxides, the protons are around 3-4.5 ppm, but maybe in this case, it's an ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR would show an absorption around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch, but the peak at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's suppose that. Then the 1H NMR would have a peak for the carbonyl adjacent protons. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, perhaps it's an acetone group, where the CH3 groups are split into a triplet, but wait, the 4.79 ppm is more upfield for a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol converted into a ketone, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But the IR would show an ester carbonyl, but the question says the product is a light yellow solid, which could be an ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show C=C absorption. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is further reacting.

Alternatively, maybe the initial step forms an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? Unlikely, as cyclopropane would have unique NMR signals.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH, high temperature. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via a [1,3]-elimination. Wait, that might be something like a Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes
