Okay, so I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each combining some of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? So, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, right? So the operators are built from the SM fields and their covariant derivatives, respecting the SM gauge symmetry and other symmetries.

Symmetries in physics theories are crucial because the operators must respect them. So, I need to figure out which of these four symmetries all SMEFT operators must obey.

First, Lorentz symmetry (option 1). I remember that Lorentz symmetry is part of the Poincare group. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar. Because if an operator isn't a scalar, the theory would break Lorentz invariance. So yes, Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry (option 2). Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So, Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is not only Lorentz invariant but also invariant under spacetime translations. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry than Lorentz? Because Lorentz is a subgroup of Poincare. Now, SMEFT is built as an effective theory. Effective theories are typically Lorentz-invariant, but do they have to respect Poincare?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the effective theory is constructed in a Lorentz-invariant way. But what about translation invariance? Well, effective theories are usually formulated with a fixed background, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that includes all possible interactions respecting the SM gauge symmetry, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. So, I think SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, but does the Poincare symmetry apply beyond that?

Hmm, maybe Poincare symmetry isn't necessarily required. Because in SMEFT, the leading terms are the SM terms, and the higher-dimensional operators are added. But if the SM respects Poincare, then the SMEFT, which includes it, should too. Or wait, is Poincare just a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if Lorentz is respected, then Poincare is automatically respected? No, not necessarily. Because Poincare also includes things like momentum translation. Wait, but in a quantum field theory, the Poincare symmetry is more about the generators of the Poincare group, which includes the momentum and angular momentum. So, if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, does that imply Poincare invariance?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: the Poincare group is the combination of the Lorentz group and the group of translations. So, a theory that's Poincare-invariant is both Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. But in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed with higher-dimensional terms, like (1/Lambda) * (some operator). But in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the operators must be scalars, but what about translations? Well, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the terms would still be translation-invariant, because each operator is just a product of fields and derivatives, which commute with translations.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So, all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely required. So, option 2 (Poincare symmetry) is maybe automatically satisfied because the SM respects it and SMEFT is an extension. Or wait, perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a separate symmetry they must respect beyond Lorentz symmetry. Because if the operators are Lorentz scalars, then they automatically transform correctly under Poincare? Hmm, not necessarily. Poincare includes more than Lorentz. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps the operators in SMEFT are required to be Poincare scalars, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe SMEFT doesn't require Poincare symmetry because it's an effective theory at a certain scale. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck on this point. Maybe I should think about each option.

CP symmetry (option 3). I know that the SM is approximately CP symmetric, except for certain terms like the CKM matrix which can cause CP violation. But in SMEFT, operators can violate CP if the underlying physics at a higher scale does so. For example, if there are new physics particles that are not CP eigenstates, then the effective operators could break CP. So, SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. So, option 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric. In effective theories, I think the operators must also respect CPT symmetry because it's part of the basic structure of the theory. So all SMEFT operators should preserve CPT symmetry because it's a necessary condition for a consistent quantum field theory. So option 4 (CPT) is a must-respect.

So, summarizing:

1. Lorentz: yes
2. Poincare: I'm not sure. Let me think again. The SM is Poincare invariant because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and the Poincare group includes translations. So in SMEFT, the operators are built in a way that respects Lorentz, but do they also need to respect translations? Well, for the theory to be Poincare-invariant, it's necessary that the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare, which includes being a scalar under Lorentz and being translation invariant. Since the SMEFT is built as an effective theory that's Lorentz-invariant, the operators are Lorentz scalars, which automatically are also Poincare scalars? Or is there more to it?

Wait, perhaps the Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and the Lagrangian is a scalar. Because the Lagrangian is a scalar, which implies it's invariant under Lorentz transformations. But Poincare includes translations. So, for a scalar, the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations as well. Because when you translate space, you shift the fields, but the Lagrangian density (which is a scalar) doesn't change. So, yes, a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian is automatically Poincare-invariant. Because the entire Lagrangian is a Lorentz scalar, and translation invariance is a part of the Poincare group.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian is a function of spacetime, so under translations, it's invariant because the fields are translated in a way that the Lagrangian density remains the same. So, yes, if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's automatically Poincare-invariant.

Therefore, if all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, then they automatically respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is also a must-respect symmetry.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if the operator is a Lorentz scalar, it's a scalar under the Lorentz group. But Poincare is more than just Lorentz. So, for the operator to be a scalar under Poincare, it must also be invariant under translations. But since the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar, the operators themselves don't have to be invariant under translations—they are part of the terms in the Lagrangian which are. Wait, maybe I'm conflating the operator with the Lagrangian.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So, the operators (which are part of the Lagrangian) must be Lorentz scalars, but do they need to be translation scalars as well? Because under translation, the entire Lagrangian is invariant, which it is when you have a local theory. So, perhaps the operators don't have to be invariant under translations themselves; the invariance comes from the structure of how the Lagrangian is built.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check my understanding. The Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. A theory is Poincare invariant if the Lagrangian is a scalar under this group. But the SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So, it's automatically Poincare-invariant as well. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are allowed to have higher dimensions, but they're still constructed as Lorentz scalars. So, the terms in the Lagrangian are scalars, so the theory is Poincare-invariant.

So, that would mean that option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I might be mixing up what applies to the operators versus the Lagrangian.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is a subset of the symmetries that the operators must respect. Because the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a Poincare scalar. So, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar, which includes being a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar.

Therefore, the operators must be Poincare scalars as well. So, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.

So, to recap:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes (must be respected)
2. Poincare Symmetry: Yes (must be respected)
3. CP Symmetry: No (not necessarily)
4. CPT Symmetry: Yes (must be respected)

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe Poincare is automatically respected if Lorentz is. But according to this, both must be respected.

Wait, but think about the structure: the Poincare algebra includes Lorentz, but to have Poincare symmetry, you need more than just Lorentz. So, an operator that is a Lorentz scalar doesn't necessarily have to be a Poincare scalar. Or does it?

Wait, Poincare includes translations. So, for a term to be a Poincare scalar, it must transform correctly under both Lorentz transformations and translations. But when you construct an operator in SMEFT, it's built as a Lorentz scalar, but perhaps not necessarily a Poincare scalar.

Wait, but if the operator is a scalar under Lorentz, then under a translation, it's just shifted by the same amount in all points. But for the operator to be a Poincare scalar, the operator must transform in a way that leaves it invariant under the Poincare group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators don't have to be invariant under translations themselves, but the entire Lagrangian must be. So the individual terms (operators) don't need to be translation invariant; the sum of the terms in the Lagrangian is.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is a function of spacetime, so for it to be invariant under translations, the form of the Lagrangian must be the same at every point. Which it is, provided the operators are local and constructed from fields and derivatives.

But maybe the individual operators don't need to care about translations because the way they're combined into the Lagrangian takes care of translation invariance.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the answer choices.

The options are:

A) 1,2 (Lorentz and Poincare)
B) 3,4 (CP and CPT)
C) 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT)
D) 1,3,4 (Lorentz, CP, CPT)

Earlier, I thought that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), CPT (4), but I'm uncertain about Poincare (2) and CP (3).

So, let's reevaluate.

Do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think yes, because the SM is Poincare-invariant, and SMEFT extends it, so the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Because if an operator violates Poincare, then the theory would break that symmetry, which isn't acceptable. So, yes, 2 is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, SMEFT operators must be Poincare scalars. So, 2 is correct.

CP symmetry: some operators in SMEFT can violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator violates CP? Wait, no, the Weinberg operator is (sLL d R)(sLL d R), which is CP-even? Or perhaps not. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, some operators can be CP-odd. But the point is, SMEFT includes operators that can break CP if the new physics allows it. So, operators in SMEFT don't have to preserve CP; it's not a necessary symmetry. So option 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry: the SM respects CPT, and SMEFT as an effective theory must respect it as well because otherwise, the theory would not be unitary. So, all operators must respect CPT.

So, the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So, that's options 1, 2, 4. Which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that if the operators are Lorentz scalars, then they're automatically Poincare scalars. But is that correct?

Wait, no, because Poincare includes translations as well. So, the operator itself doesn't have to be invariant under translations, because the translation invariance is built into the Lagrangian. So, the operator being a Lorentz scalar doesn't imply Poincare scalar for the operator itself. However, the entire Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar because it's built from Lorentz scalars and the theory is translation-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about the operators. So, the operators are part of the Lagrangian. So, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, the operators must form Poincare scalars.

Hmm, but operators, in themselves, aren't Lorentz scalars or Poincare scalars; their combination in the Lagrangian is. Or perhaps each operator must be a Poincare scalar by itself.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the operators themselves are Poincare scalars or the entire Lagrangian is. The Poincare symmetry of the theory requires that the Lagrangian is a scalar, so each term in it must be a scalar under Poincare. So, each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

But wait, Lorentz scalars are already a subset. So, if an operator is a Lorentz scalar, it's a Poincare scalar under the subgroup. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the operators don't have to be Poincare scalars on their own, but the entire Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the symmetries mean for the form of the operators. Lorentz symmetry requires that each operator is a scalar under Lorentz transformations. For Poincare, each operator must be a scalar under the entire Poincare group, including translations. But how can an operator be a scalar under translations? Because translation invariance would imply that the operator doesn't change when you shift spacetime, which is a global property. But operators in the Lagrangian vary under translations because the Lagrangian density must remain the same. Or wait, perhaps the terms in the Lagrangian must be such that when you translate the coordinates, the form remains the same. So the way the operators are constructed must take that into account.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't one of the symmetries that the operators themselves must respect beyond Lorentz symmetry. Because the SMEFT is built in a way that the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant, but they don't have to be built to be invariant under translations on their own. The invariance under translations is handled by the structure of the theory, not by each operator individually.

Wait, but the theory's invariance under translations is crucial. So, the SMEFT must be a translation-invariant theory. Which implies that the operators, when constructed, must be such that the Lagrangian is invariant under translations. But each operator is just a local term; the translation invariance comes from the fact that the Lagrangian is the same at every point.

So, perhaps the operators themselves don't need to respect translation invariance as a symmetry; rather, the total Lagrangian does because it's built from local terms. Therefore, the operators must be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare scalars. So, in that case, option 2 (Poincare) is not a required symmetry for the operators.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the entire Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. If that's the case, then each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. So, each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Hmm, maybe I should look for authoritative sources. From what I remember, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry, but perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators don't necessarily have to be invariant under translations on their own. The theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant because the Lagrangian is a scalar, but each individual operator doesn't need to be.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the operators. Therefore, the operators must be such that when combined, the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar. So, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and under translations, the Lagrangian remains the same. But the operators themselves don't necessarily have to be invariant under translations because the sum of terms can be invariant even if individual terms aren't.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach: in the Standard Model, the operators are Poincare scalars. So, in the SMEFT, which is an extension, the operators should also be Poincare scalars. Therefore, yes, option 2 is correct.

So, putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So, the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, that's option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but what about CPT symmetry? The SM respects CPT, and so must SMEFT. So, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So, the correct symmetries are 1,2,4, which is option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The Poincaré group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, it is also Poincaré-invariant. The operators in SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, which must be a Poincaré scalar. Thus, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is approximately CP-symmetric, but SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry if the underlying new physics does so. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and the SM respects it. Since SMEFT is an effective theory extending the SM, all operators in SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry to maintain a consistent quantum field theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
