Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I remember that particles moving at relativistic speeds require using the theory of relativity, specifically the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So first, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me write that down. Gamma equals 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2). Simplify that denominator: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of 0.0784... Wait, what's the square root of 0.0784? Let me calculate that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would be 6 protons and 6 neutrons? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li normally has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 total nucleons.

So the nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent particles. Alternatively, I think the mass of Li-6 is approximately known, but I might need to look it up.
