Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of molecular symmetry. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry elements are crucial for determining a molecule's point group. C3h—wait, what's the C3h point group again? I think it's a type of trigonal planar symmetry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to recall. Oh right, C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a mirror plane, and maybe some other elements. Or wait, no, C3h is actually a subgroup. Let me think. Oh yeah, C3h has a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have three-fold rotational symmetry and at least one mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other complex ones with benzo and triphenyleno parts. Let's go through them one by one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is a central boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. So each isopropyl group is a substituent. Wait, does this molecule have any symmetry? Let me visualize it. All three substituents are the same, so there's a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. Oh, wait, but wait—each isopropyl group is symmetrical, but the molecule itself. Since all three substituents are identical, it has a three-fold rotation axis. So the molecule is symmetric under 120-degree rotations. What about mirror planes? Hmm, I'm not so sure. I think triisopropyl borate is actually in the C3v point group, but wait, or is it C3h? Or maybe something else. Wait, the point group depends on the presence of mirror planes. If the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, then it might be C3h. But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should come back to this one.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure but with a bridge. Wait, no—quinuclidine is a bicyclo structure with a seven-membered ring. I believe it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane derivative. Quinuclidine has a chair-like structure, and it's known for having a high barrier to ring inversion. But what about symmetry? I think quinuclidine has a center of inversion. Let me think: can I rotate it by 180 degrees and get the same structure? If so, that would imply a center of inversion. Alternatively, maybe a plane of symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine's structure—if I imagine it, it's a bridge with three bridges of similar length. So perhaps it's symmetric across a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it has a C2 axis. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has an S4 axis or something else. Wait, I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about its symmetry elements. Oh, wait, quinuclidine is known to have a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it belong to the Oh point group? Or maybe not. Wait, another thought: quinuclidine is a molecule with a bridgehead structure, and it has a center of inversion. So perhaps it's in the C2h or another point group. But I'm not certain if it has a C3 symmetry. Since quinuclidine's structure is more complex, maybe it doesn't have a three-fold axis.

Now, the third option is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the name. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system with several ketone groups. The numbering is 1,3,4,6,7,9 for the hexaone, so six ketone groups in specific positions. Wait, but the exact structure is a bit hard to visualize. Let's think about symmetry. If it's a benzo ring fused to a trifuran, which is a three-membered ring with oxygen atoms? Wait no, trifuran is a five-membered ring with three oxygen atoms? Or wait, no, a furan is a five-membered ring with one oxygen. Trifuran would have three oxygens? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps it's a tricyclic system. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule where a benzene ring is fused to a tricyclic system. Alternatively, I'm not exactly sure. But trying to think about symmetry: if the molecule has a three-fold axis, that would be a requirement for C3h. So maybe this benzo-trifuran system has three-fold symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees, then it might have a C3 axis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of multiple ketones could indicate symmetry. But I'm not sure.

The last option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this is similar to the previous one but with triphenylene instead of benzo. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system, I think. So this molecule has a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran system with multiple ketones. Again, the structure is complex, but the key is symmetry. If the substituents are arranged such that a three-fold rotation would leave the molecule looking the same, that's a big clue. Additionally, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane would confirm C3h.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think about each molecule's point group.

Starting with triisopropyl borate. The structure is (i-Pr)3B-O. Wait, no, triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. Boron is the central atom with three isopropyl groups. All three groups are the same, so it has a trigonal planar arrangement. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis (C3). Now, does it have any mirror planes? If I imagine looking down the C3 axis, are there any planes? Well, in the trigonal planar arrangement, there are three mirror planes that pass through each bond and the opposite vertex. So that would give it C3v symmetry. Wait, C3v includes a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes. But for C3h, the mirror plane is horizontal. So in this case, if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h. But does (i-Pr)3BO have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Boron is in the center, and each isopropyl is symmetric. So any plane that's perpendicular to the molecular plane (like a horizontal mirror) would reflect the molecule onto itself. So yes, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make it C3h, not C3v. Wait, but wait: C3v has vertical mirror planes, and C3h has a horizontal mirror plane. Oh wait, no, not exactly. Let me think about the point groups.

C3h has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a rotation of 120 degrees, and there's a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis (i.e., horizontal). So for triisopropyl borate, if the molecule is flat, with the B atom in the center and the three isopropyl groups around it, then a rotation of 120 degrees would leave it unchanged. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would reflect the molecule onto itself. So yes, this molecule should have C3h symmetry. So option C is triisopropyl borate, and if I'm right, it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Let's check quinuclidine. Quinuclidine has a structure that's bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane. The point group is Td, I think. Because the molecule is symmetric with a tetrahedral arrangement of its substituents. Alternatively, wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another molecule. No, quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic structure with a chair-like conformation. It has a center of inversion, so it's in the Ci point group. But Ci doesn't have a three-fold axis. So quinuclidine doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Now the third and fourth options are the complex fused rings.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let me think about the structure. The benzo ring is fused to a trifuran system, which I think refers to a furan ring (5-membered with one O) but perhaps arranged in a tricyclic system. The presence of the substituents (the ketones) at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Hmm. If the molecule has a three-fold symmetry, with substituents arranged every 120 degrees, then it would have a C3 axis. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement is such that a three-fold rotation would not leave the molecule unchanged. Without a clear image, it's hard to tell. But the presence of six ketone groups might suggest some symmetry. Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric across three axes, each 120 degrees apart, then it would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this is a triphenylene fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system. So perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that every 120 degrees, a rotation would leave the molecule unchanged, then it would have a C3 axis. Additionally, if there is a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a higher symmetry, like D3h or something else.

Wait, but the question is about C3h. So which of these options has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): I think it does.

Now looking at the other options, perhaps the benzo-fused one (option B) doesn't have a three-fold symmetry because the substituents are in different positions. Let's see: the substituents are at 1,3,4,6,7,9. If I number the positions as in the fused rings, maybe they are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering suggests that the substituents are at every other position, leading to some symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, but the key is that the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate definitely has a three-fold rotation axis (all three substituents are same), and a horizontal mirror plane (since the molecule is flat with the central B). So its point group is C3h.

The other options: quinuclidine (D) is Ci. The benzo-trifuran (B) and triphenylene-trifuran (A) options might have higher symmetry, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the benzo system disrupts the three-fold symmetry. For example, if the benzo ring is fused in a way that doesn't allow for 120-degree rotations, then it wouldn't have C3h.

So, based on my reasoning, the correct answer is triisopropyl borate, which is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) and at least one horizontal mirror plane (**σₕ**). Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule consists of a triphenylene fused to a trifuran system with six ketone groups. While triphenylene itself has a high degree of symmetry, the fusion with the trifuran system and the specific arrangement of the ketones likely disrupt the three-fold symmetry. Additionally, the presence of the fused rings and substituents does not clearly indicate a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system with six ketone groups. The benzo ring introduces asymmetry, and the arrangement of the ketones at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 suggests that a three-fold rotation would not leave the molecule unchanged. Furthermore, the fused benzo ring likely disrupts the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, this molecule does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate
Triisopropyl borate, with the formula (i-Pr)₃BO, has a central boron atom surrounded by three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. This structure has a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane (**σₕ**), making it belong to the **C₃h** point group. Thus, this molecule exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]heptane derivative with a chair-like structure. It has a center of inversion (**i**) but does not possess a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
The only molecule that satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry is **triisopropyl borate**.
