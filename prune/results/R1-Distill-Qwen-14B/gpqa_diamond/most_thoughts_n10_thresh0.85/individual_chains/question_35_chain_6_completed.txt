Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a specific angular momentum operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that the operator A_y (Ay) is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I should probably write down what Ay looks like.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So let's compute that.

The matrix S is:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i,  0 ]

Multiplying each element by c. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -(h/(4π))i ], [ (h/(4π))i, 0 ] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ 0, -(h i)/(4π) ]
[ (h i)/(4π), 0 ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So, let's set up the equation. The matrix (Ay - λI) is:

[ -λ , -(h i)/(4π) ]
[ (h i)/(4π) , -λ ]

The determinant would be (-λ)(-λ) - [ (h i)/(4π) ]^2. So,

λ² - [ (h i)/(4π) ]^2 = 0.

Wait, let me compute [ (h i)/(4π) ]^2. Squaring that gives (h^2 i^2)/(16 π²) = (h^2 (-1))/(16 π²). So,

The equation becomes λ² - ( -h²/(16 π²) ) = 0 → λ² + h²/(16 π²) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give λ² = - h²/(16 π²), so λ = ± i h/(4π). But wait, that's the case if I made a mistake in the determinant. Let me double-check.

Wait, determinant is (element (1,1) * element (2,2)) - (element (1,2) * element (2,1)). So,

Ay - λI is:

[ -λ, ( -h i/(4π) ) ]

[ (h i/(4π)), -λ ]

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-h i/(4π)) * (h i/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (-h^2 i^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Which simplifies to λ² - [ (h² (i^2) )/(16 π²) ) ].

Since i^2 is -1, this becomes λ² - [ (h² (-1))/(16 π²) ) ] = λ² + h²/(16 π²) = 0.

So, λ² = -h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± i h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. That's interesting. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the eigenvalues are presented with real and imaginary parts. So for the options, which ones align with this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, but my eigenvalues are pure imaginary, so real part is zero. So A isn't correct.

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real part ±1. Well, our eigenvalues are imaginary, but the values are ±i h/(4π). So if h is Planck's constant, but in terms of the units, perhaps h is in some scaled form. Wait, but I think the actual value of h is part of the eigenvalues, so the eigenvalues are multiples of h/(4π). So option B says 1/2 and 1 for real and imaginary parts, which don't match.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum, the square of the operator commutes with all components, so if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But does it commute with A_z? No, because [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x, which is non-zero. So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it can't be an eigenfunction of A_z. So in option C, the statement says that φ can be eigenfunction of A² but not Az, which is correct. So C might be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, that's a bit vague. The basis functions of Ay would probably be the standard basis vectors, like |+> and |->, but the eigenvectors might not necessarily be the same as the basis. I think this might not be correct, unless the matrix is diagonal. But since Ay is a 2x2 matrix that's not diagonal, the eigenvectors are not the basis vectors of the original space. So D might not be correct.

So, going back: the eigenvalues are ± i h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So among the options, none of the A or B options fit because they have real parts. So the correct statement must be either C or D.

Wait, but let's think about the eigenvectors. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of S_y are the spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction, which are superpositions of the standard basis vectors. So, the eigenvectors are not the same as the standard basis, which are eigenstates of S_z or S_x. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which I think is incorrect because the basis functions of Ay would be the eigenvectors, which are different from the standard basis. So D is probably incorrect.

So the only correct statement left is C. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, another thought: A is the angular momentum operator. So A² is the square, which commutes with Ay, so if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it must also be an eigenfunction of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But for Az, since [Ay,Az] is non-zero, the eigenfunctions of Ay aren't eigenfunctions of Az. So statement C is correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The matrix \( A_y \) is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -\frac{h i}{4\pi} \\
\frac{h i}{4\pi} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \) is solved. The matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) is:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & -\frac{h i}{4\pi} \\
\frac{h i}{4\pi} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(-\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right) = \lambda^2 + \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Solving \( \lambda^2 + \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \), the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = \pm \frac{i h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so any option claiming nonzero real parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, and their imaginary parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 2\pi h \).

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, and their imaginary parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the standard basis vectors, which are eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
