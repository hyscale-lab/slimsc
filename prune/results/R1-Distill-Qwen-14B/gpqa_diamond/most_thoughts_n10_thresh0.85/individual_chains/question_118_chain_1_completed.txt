Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the major outcome when 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol reacts with bromine. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when enols react with halogens like bromine, it's usually a dihalogenation reaction. Enols are compounds with an enol group, which is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond, so they can undergo some interesting reactions. I think the double bond is involved here because the enol has that conjugated structure.

Wait, the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the structure must be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond starting at position 1. Then, the hydroxyl group is attached to position 1 as well, making it an enol. And there are two methyl groups on the same carbon at position 4. So the structure is cyclopentene with substituents.

When enols react with bromine (Br2), I think the reaction is similar to the addition of bromine to double bonds, but with some specific regiochemistry. Oh right, the enol has a conjugated double bond between C1 and C2 because the cyclopentene is at position 1. Wait no, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, right? Because the numbering starts at the OH group. So the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the molecule is cyclopent-1-enol with substituents. Now, bromine adds across double bonds via an electrophilic addition mechanism. Since the enol is conjugated, the addition could happen in a specific way. Wait, but enol ethers are more reactive than simple alkenes because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen, but in this case, it's an enol (alcohol adjacent to a double bond).

Wait, no, the enol itself is more reactive than an alkene because the lone pair on the oxygen can conjugate with the double bond, making it more electron-rich. So adding bromine would proceed via an addition reaction.

In general, when a di- or tri-substituted alkene reacts with bromine, the addition is typically anti and follows the bromonium ion formation. But in the case of cyclic enols, I think the endo rule might come into play. The endo transition state is more favorable because it allows for better orbital overlap and possibly some secondary orbital interactions.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, the bromine could add across the double bond, leading to a di-substituted di-bromide. But wait, the starting material is an enol, which is a cyclic structure. So when the double bond is between C1 and C2, adding bromine would add Br atoms across those positions.

Wait, but more accurately, the enol is in a conjugated position. So when bromine adds, it would form a bromohydrin? Or wait, no, I think in this case, since we have an enol, the reaction would be more like the addition of bromine to the double bond, leading to vicinal dibromide. Because adding Br2 to an alkene usually gives a dibromide.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is an enol. The structure is cyclopentene with OH on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond, leading to 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol? But let me think of the stereochemistry.

Wait, the positions where the Br adds on the cyclopentane ring. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let me draw it in my mind: the ring is cyclopentane, with a double bond between C1 and C2. C1 has an OH group and is part of the double bond. C4 has two methyl groups. So when Br2 adds, it adds across C1 and C2. Each Br would add to opposite sides because the addition is anti.

So the product would have Br on C1 and C2. But wait, the OH is on C1. Oh wait, no. The OH is on C1, which is already part of the double bond. So when Br2 adds, the OH would be on one of the Brs? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the OH is on C1, which is where one Br would be added.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The enol has the structure where C1 is double-bonded to C2 and has an OH group. So the structure is:

C1 (OH) double bonded to C2, which is single bonded to C3, and so on around the ring. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would add across C1 and C2.

Wait, but the OH is on C1. So during the addition, the Br would add to C1 and C2. But since the molecule is cyclic, the positions are adjacent. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with the hydroxyl group on C1. But wait, if C1 already has an OH, how would another Br add there?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because in an enol, the structure is an enol, which is a conjugated diene and an alcohol. Wait no, an enol is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH group on C1.

So when Br2 adds to the double bond, it will add across C1 and C2. So each Br would add to each carbon, but considering that the ring is already substituted. So the product would be a vicinal dibromide, with Br on C1 and C2, and the OH still on C1.

Wait, but that would mean the OH is on C1 and a Br is also on C1. So the structure would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-1-hydroxy... Wait, but that's not possible because C1 can't have three substituents. Wait, the structure is a five-membered ring. Let me think about the chair or the ring structure. Maybe the OH is on C1, and when Br adds to C1 and C2, the OH would be on the same carbon as one of the Brs.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the OH and Br being on adjacent carbons. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, but the OH is on C1. But in reality, C1 can't have two substituents if it's a ring structure. Unless it's a bridge or something, but in this case, it's a simple cyclopentane.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add Br to the double bond but instead leads to some kind of substitution. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Enols reacting with Br2 usually undergo addition across the double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the enol can tautomerize to a ketone. Oh wait, right! Enols can tautomerize to ketones or aldehydes. So in this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol can tautomerize to 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Because the enol form is in equilibrium with the keto form.

So if the enol is treated with bromine, which reaction is more favorable? The addition to the double bond or the tautomerization to the ketone and then reaction?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the reaction between the enol and bromine. The enol can react either via addition to the double bond or undergo tautomerization first.

Wait, when an enol reacts with a halogen like bromine, it's more likely to form a bromohydrin if there's water, but in this case, it's just reacting with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic attack because of the conjugated double bond. So when Br2 adds, it would add to the double bond, leading to a di-substituted dibromide.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. The enol is cyclopent-1-enol, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So when Br2 adds, we get a 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol.

But looking at the options, I see options A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option B and C are bromocyclopentanones.

Wait, so if the enol adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol, then the product would be either option A or D, which are stereoisomers. The options are (1R,2S) and (1R,2R) configurations.

But wait, how does the addition of Br2 proceed in terms of stereochemistry? Bromine adds in an anti addition. So when the bromine adds, the two Br atoms will be on opposite sides of the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the ring structure. Since it's a cyclopentane, adding Brs across C1 and C2 would create a diastereomer. But the starting material is a ring, so the addition could lead to a trans configuration.

Wait, but actually, in a cyclic structure, the addition of Br2 across a double bond would lead to a diepoxide-like addition, but for Br, it's a vicinal dihalide. The stereochemistry would depend on the geometry of the double bond and the addition mechanism.

But in this case, the starting enol is a cyclopentene, which is a cyclic structure. So the double bond is in the ring, and adding Br2 would open the ring into a di-substituted dibromide, but wait cyclopentene would have the double bond within the ring, not as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the position where the Br adds. The enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would add to C1 and C2, which are adjacent in the ring. So the product would be a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option D is (1R,2R). So the question is about the configuration of the Brs.

Since the addition of Br2 is anti, the two Brs would be on opposite sides. So considering the ring structure, the configuration would depend on the starting geometry.

Wait, but the starting enol is part of a ring, so the double bond is in a ring. When adding Br2, the ring opens, but wait no, the cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with a double bond. So adding Br2 would result in a diegeminal dibromide? No, wait, it's a vicinal addition, across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the chair structure or the ring's substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add Br2 but instead leads to a different outcome.

Wait, but another possibility is that the enol tautomerizes to the ketone before reacting. If the enol converts to the ketone, then reaction with Br2 would be different.

Wait, when an enol tautomerizes to a ketone (like cyclopentanone), then adding bromine would not directly add to the ring. Wait, but bromine is an electrophilic addition agent. So adding Br2 to a ketone's carbonyl group would lead to a dibromide. But wait, no, the carbonyl is a good site for electrophilic attack, but bromine reacts via a different mechanism.

Wait, no. I think that adding Br2 to a ketone would not lead to addition but perhaps some kind of substitution or not react at all. Because ketones are generally not very reactive towards Br2 unless there's an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone upon reaction with Br2. No, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition. Wait, the enol is more conjugated, so perhaps the bromine would add in a conjugate fashion.

Wait, but in this case, the enol has a double bond, so adding Br could form a bromoalkene or a di-substituted product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrin formation, but that usually involves water or another nucleophile. Since the problem is just with Br2, maybe it's a simple addition.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the product structures.

Options:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

So options B and C are ketones, meaning the enol would have tautomerized to a ketone and then reacted.

But if the enol didn't tautomerize and instead bromine added to the double bond, the product would be a di-substituted alcohol (options A and D).

So which pathway is more likely? Does the enol add Br2 to the double bond or tautomerize first?

I think that in the presence of a dienol, adding bromine would lead to the dihalide addition rather than tautomerization, unless the conditions favor the keto form.

Wait, but the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic addition because the lone pair on the oxygen conjugates with the double bond, making it more electron-rich. So Br2 would add to the double bond, leading to a di-bromide. That would produce cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2.

So the product would be a 1,2-dibromo derivative. Looking at the options, options A and D are the diastereomers of this.

Now, the question is about the configuration. Since the addition of Br2 is anti, the two Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring. So the configuration would be trans.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the trans addition would result in a certain stereochemistry. Let's imagine the ring in a chair-like conformation, though cyclopentane isn't as chair-like as cyclohexane. But for the sake of argument, when adding Br to C1 and C2 in a trans fashion, what would the configuration be.

Assuming the starting enol is in a certain configuration, the addition of Br would lead to either erythro or threo diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the more stable diastereomer, considering ring strain.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of the structure.

The starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The OH is on C1, with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents at C4 are two methyl groups.

When Br2 adds across C1 and C2, the anti addition would lead to the two Brs being on opposite sides. Now, considering the ring, which substituents are where.

Wait, perhaps the major factor here is whether the addition leads to a trans or cis configuration. If it's anti, the Brs are trans.

But in a ring, the positions are fixed. So if the starting enol is in a certain conformation, the Brs would be added in a way that leads to either (1R,2S) or (1R,2R) configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the stereochemistry isn't the main point here, and the reaction favors the diastereomer that's more stable, perhaps due to less strain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the main product is a bromohydrin, but I think that's when water is present.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an addition but a substitution, but I don't think that's the case here.

So, to summarize: The enol reacts with Br2, adding across the double bond. The product is a vicinal dibromide, with Br on C1 and C2, and the OH remains on C1.

Looking at the options, that would be options A or D. Now, the configuration depends on the addition. Since the addition of Br2 is anti, the Brs are on opposite sides. So in the cyclopentanol, the Brs are on opposite faces.

In a five-membered ring, this creates a certain diastereomer. Now, considering the positions of the methyl groups on C4, which are in a fixed position, the addition of Brs would lead to either R and S configurations.

Wait, perhaps the major product is (1R,2S), or maybe (1R,2R) depends on the transition state.

Wait, but perhaps the endo transition state is more favorable, leading to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration isn't the key point, and the options are more about whether the product is a diol or a ketone.

Wait, but considering that the enol could tautomerize to a ketone, which would then react with Br2. But ketones don't typically add Br2 in the same way as alkenes. They might undergo some kind of substitution, but not sure.

Wait, but if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. Then, adding Br2 to a ketone doesn't usually add to the carbonyl. Because the carbonyl is more reactive, but bromine might not do that without some other condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone could undergo some kind of alpha bromination. Oh wait! That's another possibility.

I remember that enols can undergo alpha bromination when treated with Br2. The reaction is the addition of bromine to the alpha position, leading to a brominated ketone.

So if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then in the presence of Br2, the alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) would undergo bromination.

Wait, but the enol is more reactive than the ketone. So which pathway is more favorable? The addition to the double bond or the tautomerization followed by alpha bromination.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think that the alpha bromination of ketones typically requires a different set of conditions, like a Lewis acid catalyst, whereas the addition to the double bond is straightforward.

So perhaps the major product is the addition product, which is a vicinal dibromide. So the product would be either A or D.

But looking at the options, option B and C are brominated at the 2 or 4 position on the ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enol adds Br2 to form a bromide, but then tautomerizes to the ketone, leading to a brominated ketone.

Wait, but that would require the di-bromide to tautomerize, which I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial addition of Br2 leads to the formation of a bromide, and then the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, leading to the Br being at a different position.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the Br is on C2 of the ketone. Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, so Br is on C4.

If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone (cyclopentanone with methyl groups on C4), then adding Br2 could lead to bromination at the alpha position.

The alpha positions to the carbonyl are C2 and C5 (assuming the ketone is at C1). Because in the ketone form, the carbonyl is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C5.

Wait, but the starting ketone would be 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The carbonyl is at C1, and the methyl groups are on C4. So the alpha positions are C2, C3, C5, and C6? Wait, no, in a five-membered ring, the positions are C1 (carbonyl), C2, C3, C4 (with two methyl groups), and C5.

So the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. So if Br2 adds to the alpha position, it would add a Br to either C2 or C5.

So option B is 2-bromo, which is an alpha bromination. Option C is 4-bromo, which is the same carbon as the methyl groups but not an alpha carbon.

Wait, but in the ketone, the C4 has two methyl groups. So how would a Br get added there? Unless it's some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, leading to a di-substituted di-bromide. Then, the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, leading to Brs in the ring.

Wait, but adding Br2 to the double bond would give a di-substituted alcohol, which is either option A or D. But the options B and C are ketones. So perhaps the reaction leads to the ketone and a bromide.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it from another angle.

Enols are known to undergo conjugate addition reactions. So when Br2 is added, maybe the Br adds to the gamma position (conjugate addition). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrin formation. But in that case, we'd need water or another nucleophile. Since the problem only mentions Br2, that's probably not it.

Hmm. Another angle: the product options. If the product is a ketone with a Br, that suggests that the enol tautomerized to the ketone, and then a Br was added somewhere.

If the Br is on the carbonyl, that's not possible. So it's either on an alpha or beta position.

If the reaction is alpha bromination, then the Br would be on C2 or C5 of the ketone.

Looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That fits.

So the reaction process would be: enol tautomerizes to ketone, then undergoes alpha bromination with Br2.

But wait, how does alpha bromination occur? Typically, it requires a catalyst like FeBr3 or something, but maybe in the presence of Br2 and perhaps some acid, it can happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive, and the bromine adds to the double bond, leading to the di-bromide. Then, the di-bromide could tautomerize to the ketone, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but di-bromides are generally more stable than ketones, especially in the presence of Br2. So perhaps the major product is the addition product, not the ketone.

But looking at the options, the only di-bromide options are A and D. The others are ketones.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't stop at the di-bromide. Maybe the diol (the di-bromide) could undergo some elimination or other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the di-bromide is a bromohydrin, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromonium ion, which upon ring-opening, leads to the di-bromide. But the diastereomer formed would depend on the ring's substituents.

Wait, but the di-bromide would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, with the OH on one of them. So that would make the product a vicinal di-bromide with an OH.

So the options are A and D. Now, the configuration.

Assuming the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite sides. In a five-membered ring, this would lead to a certain configuration. The OH is on C1, and the Brs on C1 and C2.

Wait, but in the addition, the OH would be on C1, and Br would add to C1 and C2. But C1 can't have two substituents (the OH and a Br). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, no. The enol has an OH on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 across the double bond would add Br to C1 and C2, but the OH would still be on C1. So C1 would have Br and OH.

But in reality, that's possible because the carbon can have multiple substituents.

Wait, but in the product options, the OH is on C1, and the Brs are on C1 and C2. So in option A, it's (1R,2S). Option D is (1R,2R).

Which configuration is more likely?

The addition of Br2 is stereospecific. The Brs would add on opposite sides (anti). So in a ring, this would mean that the Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces.

In a cyclopentane ring, adding Brs anti would lead to a certain configuration. Let's imagine the ring is in a certain conformation. Let's say the OH is axial on C1. Then, adding Brs anti would place one Br on the same face as the OH and the other on the opposite face.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure how this would translate into R and S configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the more stable diastereomer, which would have the Brs in a position that minimizes ring strain.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry isn't the main point, and the major product is simply a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But the options A and D are the only ones with this structure.

So, given that, but I need to choose between A and D.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is such that the two Brs are on opposite faces, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration. Alternatively, perhaps both Brs are on the same face, leading to (1R,2R).

But without knowing the exact starting conformation, it's a bit tricky. However, in such addition reactions, the anti addition would lead to the formation of (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) as the possible stereoisomers.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: consider that the addition of Br2 to a cyclopentene would lead to a diepoxide-like structure, but for Br, it's a diegeminal dibromide, no. Wait, no, it's a vicinal dibromide.

In any case, the product would have Brs on C1 and C2, and an OH on C1. So the product is either option A or D.

But wait, looking at the substituents, the 4,4-dimethyl groups are on the same carbon as the double bond. So perhaps the addition of Br2 would lead to a specific configuration based on the substituents' positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the more stable diastereomer, which would have the Brs on the same side, leading to (1R,2R) or (1S,2S) configuration.

Wait, but without more information, it's hard to say. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a meso compound, but that would require the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, which in this case, with 4,4-dimethyl groups and a di-bromide, it's possible.

Wait, if the Brs are on opposite sides but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it could be a meso compound. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is (1R,2S), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the enol has the OH on C1 and the double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 in an anti fashion would place the Brs on opposite faces. So, considering the ring structure, the OH is on C1, and the Brs are on C1 and C2, opposite to each other.

So, for C1, the substituents are OH and Br, and for C2, it's Br.

Wait, but the substituents on C1 are OH and Br. So the configuration at C1 would depend on the positions of these groups relative to the other substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I should draw the chair or some structure, but since I can't do that, I'll have to imagine.

If the OH is axial on C1, then the Br would be added to the opposite face, which would be equatorial. But I'm not sure how that translates into R/S configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product isn't the di-bromide but the brominated ketone. Let me think again about the alpha bromination.

If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, which is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, then Br2 could add to the alpha position (C2 or C5). So the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B) or 5-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (but that's not an option).

Wait, option B is 2-bromo, which is a possible product if the Br adds to C2.

But why would the enol tautomerize? Because the reaction with Br2 may not favor the enol form. Or perhaps the enol is more reactive towards addition.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Based on the options, the likely products are either the di-bromide (A or D) or the brominated ketone (B or C).

If the reaction is a simple addition of Br2 to the double bond, the product would be A or D.

If the reaction is tautomerization followed by alpha bromination, the product would be B.

Given that, and considering that enols are more reactive towards electrophilic addition, I think the major product is the di-bromide.

So between options A and D.

Now, the configuration: if the addition is anti, the Brs are trans. In a five-membered ring, this would result in a certain stereochemistry.

But without knowing the exact conformation, I can't be certain, but I think that the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is (1R,2R), which would imply that the Brs are on the same side, which is not anti. So that would be a syn addition, which is less likely for Br2.

Wait, no, Br2 addition is typically anti. So the Brs would be on opposite sides. So the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which are enantiomers.

So option A is (1R,2S), which is one of them.

So the major product would be (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A.

But another thought: the endo rule in cyclic transition states. For cyclic alkenes, the endo transition state is more favorable, leading to the substituents being added on the same face, which would lead to cis addition. But wait, no, for bromine addition, it's anti addition regardless.

Wait, but endo refers to the transition state in Diels-Alder reactions, not in bromine addition. So perhaps that's not applicable here.

So, given that, I think the correct answer is option A.


When 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol reacts with bromine (Br₂), the reaction proceeds via electrophilic addition across the double bond. The enol structure has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2 in a cyclopentane ring. Bromine adds across the double bond in an anti addition manner, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. The hydroxyl group remains on C1, and the two bromine atoms are added to C1 and C2 in a trans configuration due to the anti addition mechanism.

The product is a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the relative positions of the substituents. Since the addition of bromine is anti, the bromine atoms are on opposite sides of the ring. This leads to the (1R,2S) configuration as the major product, which corresponds to option A.

Option B and C involve brominated ketones, which would require the enol to tautomerize to a ketone before bromination. However, the enol form is more reactive toward electrophilic addition, making the direct addition of bromine to the double bond the favored pathway. Option D, (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, represents a syn addition, which is less likely for bromine addition reactions.

Thus, the major product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A
