Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The operator is P, which is a vector operator, I think. The question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are often represented as vectors with components like Px, Py, Pz. Each component is an operator itself, a 2x2 matrix. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon here, the spin matrices are well known.

The given components are:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is a vector operator, which means that the total operator is P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, I think that means ny = 0. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. Oh wait, but the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the eigenvector will depend on the angles θ and φ, I guess.

But wait, the problem is to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n, so the operator we're considering is P·n. So the operator is P·n = nx Px + nz Pz.

The eigenvalue equation is then (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find the eigenvector for the operator (nx Px + nz Pz), with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me think about how to approach this. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of the spin operator along any direction are the spin-up and spin-down states. The spin-up state has eigenvalue +ħ/2, and the spin-down state has -ħ/2.

Wait, so the general form for an eigenvector along a direction n is given by the spin coherent state or something like that. The eigenvector can be written in terms of the angles θ and φ, where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle.

Wait, in the standard basis, for a spin-1/2 system, the spin-up state along direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is |+> = [cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2)]^T. Because the eigenvector of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction is given by that expression, right?

But in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ is zero? Or wait, no, because the x-z plane includes all directions where y-component is zero, but the direction can still have any angle θ from the z-axis, but φ (the angle in the xy-plane) is zero because it's along x-z. Wait, no, wait. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0, but any direction in x-z can be represented with angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or π, I think. So the direction vector n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ?), no, wait, the usual spherical coordinates: θ is the polar angle (from z-axis), φ is the azimuthal (around z-axis). But in x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, I think. Because x-z is the plane where y=0. So the direction can be any angle θ from z-axis and φ=0 or π.

Wait, but the problem says "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So perhaps the eigenvector depends on θ and φ, but since φ is fixed (like 0 or π), maybe the eigenvector would be written in terms of θ only?

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like the standard spin-up state in the z-direction, but without any exponential term. So that would be the case when phi is zero, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more about expressing the eigenvector in terms of the components, regardless of the angles.

Wait, let's think about it step by step. The operator P is given as a vector operator, and we need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane.

Let me denote the direction vector as n = (nx, 0, nz), because it's in x-z plane. Since it's a unit vector, we have nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P·n is:

P·n = nx Px + nz Pz.

Substituting the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n becomes (ħ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Wait, let me compute that:

Matrix for P·n is:

Top left: 0 * nx + 1 * nz = nz
Top right: 1 * nx + 0 * nz = nx
Bottom left: 1 * nx + 0 * nz = nx
Bottom right: 0 * nx + (-1)*nz = -nz

So P·n = (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, the operator is (P·n) so the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So,

(P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, so:

[[nz,
