Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-½ system.

Wait, but the state is given as proportional to that combination. So I think I should first normalize the state. Because when we say a state is proportional to something, we usually need to find the normalization constant to make it a unit vector. So let me compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write it as a vector: [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T. To normalize, I need to compute the norm squared, which is the sum of the absolute squares of each component.

So the first component is (1+i), whose absolute square is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second component is (2-i), absolute square is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i !=j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, let me write down this matrix.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-½, so two states), the matrix would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0   ]

Because when i != j, it's ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. Wait, that's an off-diagonal matrix. So what's this operator? Hmm, I think it's proportional to the Pauli X operator, but scaled.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here, the operator's elements are zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So this operator A can be written as (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because if I factor out (ħ/2), then A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

But wait, the Pauli matrices are usually represented with 1s on the off-diagonal. So that's right, A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues. Let me compute the eigenvalues. For σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±1. So for A, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But the question is about the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

First, I think I should find the eigenstates of A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

I recall that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me verify that. The eigenstates of σ_x are (up + down)/sqrt(2) and (up - down)/sqrt(2), yes.

So, to find the probability that the state |alpha> is in each of these eigenstates, we can compute the squared magnitude of the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

But wait, |alpha> is already written in terms of |up> and |down>, so perhaps it's easier to express |+x> and |-x> in the same basis and then compute the inner products.

Let me write down |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>) and |-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > would be [1/sqrt(2)] * [ (1^* + 1^*)/sqrt(7) ) ]? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>. So to compute < +x | alpha >:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

This would be 1/sqrt(2)*1/sqrt(7) [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ] evaluated as inner products.

Wait, the inner product <up|up> is 1, <up|down> is zero, etc. So expanding:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ <up|up> (1)(1+i) + <up|down> (1)(2-i) + <down|up> (1)(1+i) + <down|down> (1)(2-i) ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the inner product as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up| up > + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down| up > ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up| down > + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down| down > ]

But <up| up> is 1, <down| up> is zero, <up| down> is zero, and <down| down> is 1.

So this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 - i) * 1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The first term comes from the |up> component. The first part is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down> where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ a^* + b^* ]? Wait, no. Wait, no, because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product would be:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ a * <up| + b * <down| ] (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ??? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

< +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) ] (a |up> + b |down> )

So this is [ a <up|up> + a <down|up> + b <up|down> + b <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

Since <up|up> =1, <down|down>=1, and the cross terms are zero.

So it's [ a + b ] / sqrt(2)

Similarly, for < -x | alpha >, it would be [ a - b ] / sqrt(2), because |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's compute a and b. a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / sqrt(7). So (a + b)/sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7).

So < +x | alpha > is (3/sqrt(14)).

The probability of measuring +x is the square of the absolute value of this. So |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which adds up to 1. But let's see.

Wait, wait: 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. So that's one probability.

The other probability would be the square of | < -x | alpha > |. So let's compute that.

We have < -x | alpha > = ( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

Simplify numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i )

So (a - b)/sqrt(2) = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

The absolute square is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (7*2) ) = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that's matching option A, which has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me confirm. Hmm, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the first part of the answers would be 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, the question also asks for the average value of that operator. Oh right, the average value is the expectation value of operator A in state |alpha>.

So to find <A>, we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, then <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

So let's compute <sigma_x> = <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> .

The sigma_x operator in the computational basis (|up>, |down>) is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the expectation value is [ (a^*, b^*) ] * sigma_x * [a; b]

Which is (a^* b) + (b^* a) ), because sigma_x swaps the basis vectors.

So, let me compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Compute a^* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)
b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

Now, a^* * b = [ (1 - i)(2 -i) ] /7
= [ (2 -i - 2i + i^2) ] /7
i^2 is -1, so:
= [2 -3i -1 ] /7 = [1 -3i]/7

Similarly, b^* * a = [ (2 + i)(1 + i) ] /7
= [2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 ] /7
= [2 +3i -1]/7 = [1 +3i]/7

So sum is (1 -3i)/(7) + (1 +3i)/(7) = [2]/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7.

Therefore, <A> is (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check the calculation for <sigma_x>. Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation is a^* b + b^* a. So let me compute that again.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

a^* * b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7
= (2 -i - 2i + i^2 ) /7
= (2 -3i -1) /7
= (1 -3i)/7

b^* * a = (2 +i)(1 +i) /7
= 2*(1) + 2i +i*(1) +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= (1 +3i)/7

Adding them together:

(1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the expectation of sigma_x is 2/7, so A's expectation is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (0.64) and 5/14 (0.36), and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and calculating the average value of \( A \). The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation where \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise, corresponding to \( A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, compute the squared norm:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). These are also the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \hbar/2 \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probability of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) is:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle\uparrow| + \langle\downarrow| \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |-x\rangle \) is:
\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle\uparrow| - \langle\downarrow| \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = a^*b + b^*a,
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute \( a^* \) and \( b^* \):
\[
a^* = \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad b^* = \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
\[
a^*b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{2 - i - 2i + i^2}{7} = \frac{1 - 3i}{7}, \quad b^*a = \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2 + 3i - 1}{7} = \frac{1 + 3i}{7}.
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1 - 3i}{7} + \frac{1 + 3i}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). These results match **Option A**.
