Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is Î¸.

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged, so what happens?

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, which means the total charge on it is zero. But when we add charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's interior must adjust. I think that the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge. Because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface of the cavity must have a charge of -q. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so any charge inside the cavity would induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. So the inner surface would have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance it, since the total conductor's charge is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if the conductor was neutral, and we add +q inside, the inner surface must have -q, but the outer surface would then have +q because the conductor was neutral. Because the total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner: -q, outer: +q. So the conductor as a whole has +q.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. So when you put +q in the cavity, the conductor will have an induced charge. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have -q, because the charge +q in the cavity attracts opposite charge. But the conductor's own material's electrons would redistribute. So the inner surface has -q. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q, so the outer must be
