Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A, B, C, D, so I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with the speed of light in different media, the index of refraction comes into play. The speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, right? So in this case, the glass has an index n, so the speed should be c/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab frame?

Wait a second, this is a relativity question, maybe not. Because the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but when the medium is moving, things might change a bit. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving relative to the lab, how does that affect the speed of the light as measured in the lab? I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but is that only when the velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light? Or does it apply here even if v is much smaller than c?

The problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Oh, and the beam is moving toward the observer. So the beam is going towards the lab's observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the beam's velocity in the glass's frame is c/n. How does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, let's model this. Let me denote the lab frame as S and the glass's frame as S'. In S', the glass is at rest, and the light is moving at v_light' = c/n in the positive x direction (since the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, I need to get the directions right). No, wait, if the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well, then in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction but perhaps faster, depending on the situation.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate systems. Let's say in S (lab), the glass is moving with velocity v in the positive x direction. In S' (glass's rest frame), the light is moving at v_light' = c/n towards the negative x direction. Because in the glass, the light is moving toward the observer, which is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light' = c/n in the same direction that the glass is moving in the lab frame. So if the glass is moving in the +x direction, then in S', the light's velocity is +c/n.

But wait, when you have a medium moving, how does that affect the light's speed in the lab frame? I think the correct approach is to use the velocity transformation formulas from special relativity. So the velocity observed in lab (u) is related to the velocity in the glass's frame (u') by the Lorentz transformation.

The formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/(c²)]. But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass frame is u' = c/n. So substituting that into the equation.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Lorentz transformation for velocity when moving from S' (glass) to S (lab) is u = [u' + v]/[1 + (u' v)/(c²)]. Since the glass is moving at v in the lab's frame, but in the opposite direction perhaps? Or wait, maybe I have the direction wrong.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So if the observer is at a certain point, the glass is moving towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass (so towards the observer as well).

Wait, perhaps the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v in the +x direction, and the light in the glass's frame is moving at u' = c/n in the +x direction.

So applying the Lorentz transformation. The lab frame S sees the light moving at u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/(c²)].

Wait, but wait! Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, we add the velocities in that case. So u is [u' + v]/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

But in this case, u' is c/n. So substituting, u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v )/(c^2) ) ].

Simplify that. The denominator is 1 + (v (c/n))/(c²) = 1 + v/(n c).

So u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate the denominators.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n * n c = (c + n v) * c = c(c + n v) = c² + c n v.

Denominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v.

So u = (c² + c n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but c is 1 as per the problem statement. So substituting c = 1, u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but let me check the algebra again. Wait, I think I might have messed up a step. Let me redo the denominator.

Wait, when I have denominator 1 + (v (c/n))/c², that's 1 + (v)/(n c). So the denominator is 1 + v/(n c).

Then, when I multiply numerator and denominator by n c, the denominator becomes (1 * n c) + v. So n c + v.

The numerator is ( (c + n v)/n ) multiplied by n c, so (c + n v) * c = c² + c n v.

So u = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v).

But wait, since c is 1, that becomes (1 + n v) / (n + v). So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1, which would be the case if the speed was c in the lab frame, but that's only when the medium is at rest. But here, the medium is moving, so the speed should not be c. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. The speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, not the observer's frame. So in the lab frame, the speed of light in the glass should still be c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that's not considering the velocity of the medium.

No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light in the lab?

Wait, perhaps velocity addition is the way to go. So according to the Lorentz transformation, the speed observed in the lab is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v / c²), where u' is the speed in the glass frame. So u' = c/n.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c).

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators.

Numerator becomes (c + n v) multiplied by 1, since (c/n) * n c = c², but wait wait, let me be precise.

Wait, the numerator is (c/n + v) multiplied by (n c) when I multiply both numerator and denominator by n c.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me compute each term.

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v (c/n)) / c² ]

Which is [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * (c) / n c ?

Wait, perhaps I should factor this differently. Let me compute each part again.

Denominator after substitution:

Denominator = 1 + (v (c/n)) / c² = 1 + (v / (n c)).

So when I multiply numerator and denominator by (n c), the denominator becomes (n c) * [1 + v/(n c)] = n c + v.

The numerator becomes [ (c/n) + v ] * (n c) = [ (c + n v) / n ] * n c = (c + n v) * c.

So numerator is c(c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v.

So u = (c^2 + c n v)/(n c + v).

But since c is 1, this simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but the options have option A as (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's what I'm getting.

But wait, another thought. The speed of light in the glass is c/n regardless of the glass's motion. Because the speed of light in a medium depends only on the medium's properties, not on the motion of the medium. So in the lab frame, the speed should be c/n, which is 1/n since c=1.

But that doesn't match with the velocity addition formula. So where's the mistake here?

Hmm. Maybe I'm confusing velocity and speed. The velocity of the light is a vector, so when the medium is moving, the observed velocity of the light changes, but the speed (the magnitude) should still be c/n, because the speed of light in a medium is a property of the medium, not the observer's frame.

Wait, but in the problem, the light is moving through the glass, so the medium is moving. So the speed of the light in the glass's frame is c/n, but when the glass is moving, the observed velocity in the lab frame would change. But the speed, the magnitude, would still be c/n, so the speed is 1/n when c=1.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed would not be 1/n if the medium is moving. So I'm getting conflicting conclusions.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the speed. Because from the velocity addition formula, the observed speed isn't necessarily c/n. Wait, but in reality, doesn't the speed of light remain c in all inertial frames? Oh wait, no—because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and that's measured in the medium's frame. But in the lab frame, if the medium is moving, the speed of the light as observed would be different.

Wait, but no. Because in the lab frame, the light would be moving at a different speed when the medium is moving. So perhaps the velocity addition formula is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed in the lab frame is c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. So the speed would be 1/n, so the answer would be B) 1, but that's only if n is 1, which it's not. Wait, no, because in that case, the speed would be c/n. So if (u) is c/n, then the answer would be 1/n. But none of the options directly show 1/n. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 1, which would be the case if the speed is c, but that's only in vacuum. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the medium's velocity. If the glass is moving, perhaps the light's speed in the lab is just c/n. Because the speed of light in a medium is a property of the medium, and doesn't depend on the velocity of the medium itself. So the answer would be 1/n. But looking at the options, none of them are 1/n. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the time it takes for the light to pass through the glass from the lab's perspective. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula, leading to option A.

Wait, but let's think about the units. The options have (1 + n v)/(n + v), which has units of (dimensionless + velocity * something) over velocity * something. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether the velocity addition formula is even applicable here.

Wait, another thought: The speed of light in the lab frame when the medium is moving at velocity v. So in the medium's frame, the speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, the observed speed in the lab frame would be different. So using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c^2)).

So substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c^2 ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c)

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is (c +n v)/n * (n c)/(n c + v) )

The n cancels out:

= (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Since c =1,

= (1 + n v) * 1 / (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the speed of the light in the medium is 1/n, but according to the velocity addition formula, it's (1 + n v)/(n +v). So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the velocity addition formula applies because we're dealing with different inertial frames. So the speed in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Therefore, the answer would be option A.

But wait a second, is the speed of light in the lab frame different from its speed in the medium's frame? Because in the medium's frame, it's moving at c/n. But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, the observed speed would be higher or lower, depending on the direction.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light should always be c in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. Wait, but in the lab frame, the medium is moving. So the light's speed in the lab frame would not be c/n, but would be determined by the velocity addition formula.

So, according to the calculation, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So the correct answer would be A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), so the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is \( c/n \). Since \( c = 1 \), the speed is \( 1/n \). The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (\( u' = 1/n \)), and \( u \) is the speed of light in the laboratory frame. Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option B (\( 1 \))**: This would imply the speed of light is \( c \) in the laboratory frame, which is only true in a vacuum and not in a medium or when the medium is moving.
- **Option C (\( (1 + n v)/(n - v) \))**: The denominator is incorrect; the correct transformation involves \( n + v \), not \( n - v \).
- **Option D (\( (1 - n v)/(n + v) \))**: The numerator is incorrect; the correct numerator is \( 1 + n v \), not \( 1 - n v \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
