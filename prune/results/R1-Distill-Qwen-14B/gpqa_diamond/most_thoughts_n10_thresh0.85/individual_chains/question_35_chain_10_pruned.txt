Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Wait, the setup says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π), which is a constant. And S is a given 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down.

The matrix S is:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Ay is c times S, so let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so each element of S gets multiplied by this constant.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenvalues a are related to c times the eigenvalues of S.

What are the eigenvalues of S? For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], the eigenvalues are solutions to (a - λ)(d - λ) - bc = 0.

So for S:
The matrix is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So the characteristic equation is (0 - λ)^2 - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = ?

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the equation is λ² - 1 = 0. So λ is ±1.

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. The trace is 0, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1) )? Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's compute (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0*0 - (-i)(i) = 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) → 0 - (-i * i) → - ( -i² ) → - ( -(-1) ), because i² is -1. So that's - (1) = -1? Hmm, maybe I messed up. Alternatively, perhaps for matrix S, the determinant is (0)(0) - ( (-i) * i ) = 0 - [ (-i)*i ].

Calculating (-i)*i: -i^2 is -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1.

Wait, wait, the equation for eigenvalues is λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0. So the trace is 0, so equation is λ² + (determinant) = 0. But wait, in our case, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) = 0 - (1) = -1. So equation is λ² - (-1) = λ² +1= 0. So λ² = -1 → λ = ±i.

Wait, that's different. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me do it step by step.

The matrix S is:
Row 1: 0
