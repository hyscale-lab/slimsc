Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the task is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the normalization condition. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But wait, the wave function is given, and the measurements show that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function is zero outside this region. So I think the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That can't be right because in regions where the particle isn't found, the wave function should be zero. Or maybe the given expression is only valid where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3.

Wait, the problem says that in the part of space where the particle can exist (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is given by that expression. So outside 1 and 3, it's zero. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

But wait, the given ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So I need to compute the square of the absolute value of this function. The absolute square is ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Its complex conjugate is a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) + 0.5i.

So when I multiply them, ψ*ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts will cancel out into positive terms. Wait, let me do the multiplication:

(a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(0.5i) ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it correctly. When you multiply two complex numbers, (a - bi)(a + bi) = a² + b². Because (a - bi)(a + bi) = a^2 + a bi - a bi - (bi)^2. The middle terms cancel, and i^2 is -1, so it becomes a² + b².

In this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5. So ψ*ψ = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that seems a bit strange. Because the wave function is a sum of a real term and an imaginary term. So the modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because for a complex number, the modulus squared is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2.

So, indeed, |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ ( [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25 ) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me break that into two separate integrals:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each separately.

First integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2) because ln(4/2)=ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. Let's compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a² is about 0.7213. So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8495.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check my steps again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the wave function.

The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, I should compute (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, since the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So that part was correct.

So the integral is indeed [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25, integrated from 1 to 3.

Another thing to check is whether the wave function is correctly defined. The problem says that the wave function is given in the region where it exists, which is x between 1 and 3. So the normalization is correct.

Therefore, with a≈0.85, option B is the correct choice.


To determine the value of "a", we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), the normalization integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two results:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of "a" is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
