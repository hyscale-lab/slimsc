Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to unpack what's going on. I remember bosons are force-carrying particles, like photons or W and Z bosons. But this one is called X, so maybe it's a hypothetical particle.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I'm reading that right. Oh wait, the way it's written, it's -λ times some factors, and then X(y) is interacting with ψ_f, which I think is a fermion field. So the interaction term is between the boson X and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, the resulting particles must each have masses less than 6 GeV, right? Because in particle physics, the decay products can't be more massive than the original particle. Otherwise, it's kinematically forbidden.

So the question is asking which decay channels are allowed at the lowest order. Let me think about the possible decay modes. X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the Lagrangian has a term that couples X to fermions. So X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle, provided their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think represents fermions of a certain type. So the interaction term allows X to couple to which specific fermions? Let me look again. The term is -λff(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe the f is a flavor index? Or perhaps it's the field for fermions like leptons and quarks.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The interaction term is L = -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be something like Yukawa coupling. Oh, wait, Yukawa coupling is usually something like g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar. So here, the interaction is X ψ ψ. That suggests that X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar. So for each fermion ψ that X couples to, X can decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

So the key is to find which fermions have a mass below 6 GeV/2, because each fermion-antifermion pair has a combined mass of 2m, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than 6 GeV. Wait, but when a particle decays, the rest masses don't have to add up to less than the mass of the parent. For example, a photon is massless, but when a Z boson decays, it can decay into a pair of particles whose masses sum to less than the Z's mass. Wait, no, actually, the Z is 91 GeV, and it can decay into electron-positron pairs, whose mass is negligible. So the condition is that the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but in reality, the decay products' rest masses don't add up to more than X's mass. Because the parent is at rest, the decay products can have kinetic energy, so their combined rest mass could be less than the parent's mass. So for a decay into two particles, each particle's mass must be less than the parent's mass divided by 2? No, wait, if X is at rest and decays into two particles, each particle's rest mass must be less than half the X's mass. Because each would have at least the rest mass, and together they must add up to less than X's mass.

Wait, for example, if X is 6 GeV, each decay product's rest mass must be less than 3 GeV, because 3 + 3 =6, but if they are exactly 3 GeV each, then they can't move because they'd have zero kinetic energy. So for any decay into two particles, each must be less than 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermions and their masses. Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Leptons: electron, muon, tau, neutrinos. But neutrinos are super light, but for this purpose, let's assume they're massless.

Current known masses (approximate):

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (million eV)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~95-100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible.

Wait, so for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV is allowed.

Looking at the quarks: up, down, strange, charm are all under 3 GeV. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because each would require 4.5 GeV, but X is only 6 GeV. 4.5 *2 =9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So decay into b quarks is not allowed.

Wait, same logic for the tau lepton: tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2 *1.78 = ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Other leptons: electrons, muons are way below 3 GeV. So their pairs are allowed.

So possible fermions that X can decay into are: up, down, strange, charm quarks, tau, mu, electron, and their antiparticles.

Wait, but let's list each possible decay channel:

- b b-bar: mass sum is 4.5 *2=9 GeV >6 GeV. Not allowed.
- s s-bar: 0.1 GeV *2=0.2 GeV <<6. Allowed.
- c c-bar: 1.5 *2=3 GeV. Allowed, since
