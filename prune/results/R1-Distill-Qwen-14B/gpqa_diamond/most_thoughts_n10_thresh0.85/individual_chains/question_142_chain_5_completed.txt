Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but this one looks different.

Wait, let me break it down. The matrix ρ is the average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Each of those is a projector onto the respective basis state. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. So when I add them together, each has a 1 in their respective diagonal positions, and then I multiply by 1/2.

So let me write out what this matrix looks like. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], right? Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh, wait, that's the identity matrix scaled down by 1/2. So ρ equals (I)/2 where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this relates to how density matrices are visualized in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector representation: I remember that any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components rx, ry, rz, and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can write ρ in this form, I can find r.

So our ρ is (I)/2. Let's see: (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2 → that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I)/2 + (r·σ)/2 = (I)/2 → (r·σ)/2 = 0 → r·σ=0.

What does r·σ equal zero mean? The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are in the vector. So r · σ is rx σx + ry σy + rz σz. The trace of this would be 2rz, but for the matrix to be zero, each element must be zero.

Let me think about the matrices. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So if rx σx + ry σy + rz σz = 0 matrix, then each element must be zero.

Setting each component to zero:

For element (0,0): rz * 1 + ... wait, let me compute the matrix. rx σx is [[0, rx],[rx, 0]], ry σy is [[0, -i ry],[i ry, 0]], and rz σz is [[rz, 0],[0, -rz]]. Adding them together gives:

Top-left: rz
Top-right: rx - i ry
Bottom-left: rx + i ry
Bottom-right: -rz

For this to be zero matrix, each element must be zero.

So:

1. Top-left: rz = 0
2. Top-right: rx - i ry = 0 → rx = 0 and ry =0 because the only way a complex number is zero is both real and imaginary parts are zero. So rx = 0, ry =0.

So the only solution is r = (0,0,0). That means the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, maximally mixed. The pure states are on the surface, and the completely mixed state is the center.

Looking at the options: option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The other options: A is (1,1,0), which would have a Bloch vector pointing in some direction. B is (0,0,1), which would be the |1> state, but wait, no. Wait, the Bloch vector for |0> is (0,0,1), and for |1> it's (0,0,-1). Or wait, sometimes I get the signs mixed up. Let me think: in the Bloch sphere, the state |0> is at the north pole, which is (0,0,1), and |1> is at the south pole, (0,0,-1). So the density matrix for |0> is |0><0|, which would correspond to r=(0,0,1). Similarly, |1> is r=(0,0,-1). But our ρ is a mixed state of both. So it's somewhere in the middle, but in Bloch terms, the center is (0,0,0). Because (I/2) is the maximally mixed state, which is at the origin.

So yes, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state in quantum mechanics.

In the Bloch sphere representation, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero, meaning the state is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

The origin of the Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. Among the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state in question.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(\left|0\right\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** This corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state in question.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
