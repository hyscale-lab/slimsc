Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star's photosphere and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. The star has certain parameters when it doesn't have spots and different ones when 40% of its surface is covered by spots. The key here is to find how the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

First, I'll jot down the given data:
- Star's radius when no spots: 1.5 solar radii.
- Star's mass when no spots: 1.1 solar masses.
- Effective temperature (Teff) when no spots: 6000 K.
- When 40% surface is covered by spots, Teff drops to 5500 K.
- The observed ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two levels (level 1 and 2) decreases when spots are present.
- The transition wavelength is about 1448 Å (which is in the UV or near-UV range, I think).

Hmm. The problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio (n1/n2) changes. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. The ratio decreases, so the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the ratio given in the problem is n1/n2. So using the formula, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

But wait, the energy difference (E2 - E1) can be related to the transition wavelength. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Let me confirm: when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon of wavelength λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength given, 1448 Å. So I can compute this energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio n1/n2. So the ratio depends on the temperature. Because when the temperature decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponential term smaller, so n1/n2 would decrease. But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Let's check: when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). So T goes down.

So (E2 - E1)/(k T) would be larger for lower T. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would increase as T decreases because the exponent increases. Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Suppose the transition is from level 2 to level 1, meaning that level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)) = exp( -(hc/λ)/(k T) ). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(hc/(λ k T)) ). 

Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (hc/(λ k T)) ). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so exp increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower (5500 K), and the observed ratio decreases. Wait, that's contradictory. So according to the calculation, n1/n2 should increase when T decreases, but the problem states the ratio decreases. So perhaps I have the ratio the wrong way around?

Wait, the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, n1/n2 increases. So that suggests that perhaps the observed ratio is actually n2/n1? Because if n2/n1 decreases, then n1/n2 would increase. Hmm, maybe the way the ratio is measured is inverted. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So it's n1/n2 that's decreasing. Wait, but according to my previous reasoning, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. So that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me double-check the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the number of atoms in a higher energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). So for level 2 (higher energy), n2 = (g2/g1) * n1 * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), assuming E2 > E1. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 would increase as T decreases. But the problem says that when T is lower (spots present), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the ratio they're observing is n2/n1, which would decrease when T decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So if the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T goes down, that would imply that n1/n2 is decreasing. So how can that happen?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me write it clearly.

n_i = (g_i / Q) * exp( -E_i/(k T) )

where Q is the partition function.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, E1 is lower than E2, so E1 - E2 is negative. So exponent is positive.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) gets smaller, so the exponential term gets smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases. Because when T is higher, the exponent is smaller, so exp is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say E2 - E1 = ΔE = hc/λ.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so
