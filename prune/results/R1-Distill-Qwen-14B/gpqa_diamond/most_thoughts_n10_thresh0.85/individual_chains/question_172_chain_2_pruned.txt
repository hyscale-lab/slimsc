Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, stars and their energy levels... Right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation of atoms play a big role. The question mentions iron atoms in the photosphere of two stars, star_1 and star_2. 

So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. Wait, twice as excited... I think that relates to their excitation energy or maybe their population in a certain energy level. Oh right, in a star's photosphere under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_i) in star_1 is twice that in star_2 (n_i)_2. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Wait, perhaps it's about the excitation level. But since both are in LTE, we can assume that each star's photosphere is at its own temperature.

Wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. 

Let me think. For each star, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) depends on temperature. Since star_1 has a higher excitation (n_i for star_1 is higher), that suggests that star_1 is hotter. Because higher temperatures mean more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels.

Wait, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2.

Wait, but wait, how does that relate to the temperatures of the two stars? Let me think about the ratio for each star.

For star 1: (n_i)/(n
