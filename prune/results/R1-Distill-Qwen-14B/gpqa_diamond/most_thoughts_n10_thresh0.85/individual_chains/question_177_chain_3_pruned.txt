Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = b/T1 and λ2 = b/T2. If λ1 = λ2, then T1 must equal T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait! The radial velocities are different. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. But when we observe the star's spectrum, the Doppler effect can shift the wavelengths. If a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths get blueshifted (shorter), and if moving away, they get redshifted (longer). But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, does that mean that the observed λ_max is the same, or that the intrinsic λ_max is the same?

Hmm, I think it's the observed λ_max. So the observed λ_max1 equals observed λ_max2. Because the problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So we need to consider the Doppler shift.

Wait, so each star's emitted λ_max is determined by their temperature, but because of their velocities, the observed λ_max differs. But the problem says the observed ones are the same. So I need to calculate the intrinsic λ_max for each star, then apply the Doppler shift to see how their observed λ_max compares.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and those wavelengths are the same. So observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2.

So, for each star, the observed λ_max is given by the Doppler-shifted wavelength. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, actually when moving towards us, v is positive if moving away? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign conventions.

Wait, if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength. So the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), but z is the redshift. Wait, I think another way: when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest / (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when moving towards us). Wait, no, wait. Let me get it right.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is often used when velocities are much less than the speed of light. So v is much less than c, so we can approximate.

In the non-relativistic case, for a star moving with velocity v away from us, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). If moving towards us, it's λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c). Wait, no, that's for frequency. Let me think: frequency f_obs = f_rest * (1 + v/c), when moving away (v positive). Because when moving away, the wavelength gets longer, so frequency goes down. So λ_obs = λ_rest / (1 + v/c), approximated as λ_rest*(1 - v/c) for small v.

Wait, but in our problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? The problem says 700 km/s, but doesn't specify. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So let's figure out their intrinsic temperatures based on their observed λ_max.

Wait, maybe I should model this step by step.

Let me denote:

- λ_max1_observed = λ_max2_observed = λ_obs.

But for Star_1: v1 = 0, so λ_max1_observed = λ_max1_rest.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume that it's moving away from us (so v is positive, leading to a redshift). Then λ_max2_observed = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v/c), but wait, no, wait. Let me think again about the formula.

If a star is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive when moving away. But wait, sometimes it's written as (1 + z) where z is the redshift, and z = v/c for small v.

Alternatively, the exact Doppler shift formula (non-relativistic) for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c),

where v is positive when moving away.

So, for Star_1: v1 = 0, so λ_max1_observed = λ_max1_rest.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so λ_max2_observed = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem says that λ_max1_observed = λ_max2_observed.

So, λ_max1_rest = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but the problem states that the stars' observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, λ_max1_observed = λ_max2_observed.

So, let's denote Star_1's observed λ as λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_rest.

Star_2's observed λ is λ_max2_obs = λ
