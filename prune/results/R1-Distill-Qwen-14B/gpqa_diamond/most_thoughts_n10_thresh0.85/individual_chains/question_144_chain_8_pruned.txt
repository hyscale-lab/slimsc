Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these particle physics terms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. They've given me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters, so I need to find the right one.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Oh wait, right, the formula I think is that the mean distance (L) is equal to the velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ), so L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity and the lifetime? Let's break it down.

First, the lifetime τ. I recall that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, but wait, actually, the formula I remember is Γ = ħ c / τ, but wait, no, maybe it's Γ = ħ / τ. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, no, let's get that right. The natural linewidth comes from the uncertainty principle. The product of the energy uncertainty (Γ/2) and the time uncertainty (τ) is ħ/2. So Γ/2 * τ ≈ ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ 2ħ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Or wait, maybe it's Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Wait, I think I need to be careful with dimensions here, but perhaps I can proceed with that.

Wait, but looking it up in my notes, the correct relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the width, which is the energy, and ħ has units of energy * time, so Γ has units of energy, so ħ/Γ gives units of time. That makes sense.

So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Got it.

Next, the velocity v. How do I find that? I think I can use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The total energy E is given, which is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so it's a relativistic particle. The energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Oh wait, but I can express momentum p in terms of velocity and mass, p = γ m v. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to find the velocity from the energy.

Alternatively, the relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ is E / (m c²). Let me compute γ. Let me calculate E/(m c²). But since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, but perhaps I can compute the ratio in natural units where c=1, but I'll have to be careful with units.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity v. Let's express E in terms of m and v.

E = γ m c², and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v.

But maybe a better approach is to find the kinetic energy, but no, the given E is the total energy, production energy. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum p. Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So rearranging, (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2.

So let's compute p.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the units. Let me think in SI units.

Wait, E is given in GeV. Let me convert everything to joules. 1 GeV is approximately 1.602e-10 J. So 8 GeV is 8 * 1.602e-10 J = 1.2816e-9 J. Similarly, m_X is 1.2 GeV, so m = 1.2 * 1.602e-10 J/(c²) (since E=mc², so m=E/(c²) in appropriate units). Wait, let me think. Since E = mc², so m = E/(c²). So m_X is 1.2 GeV/c².

But maybe I can compute p in terms of E and m.

So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c². Wait, no, let me do it correctly.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c

Wait, or is it (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) / c^2? Wait, no, let's recheck the units.

Let me write it correctly. E is in joules. So E² has units of J². (pc)²: p is kg m/s, so pc has units (kg m/s)(m/s) = kg m²/s² → same as J. So (pc)^2 is J². So E² - (pc)^2 = (m c²)^2 → so yes, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c².

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because E in terms of p and m is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So solving for pc:

pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, because (pc) = sqrt(E² - (m c²)² ), so p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c² * c? Hmm, perhaps I should re-express this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute p as (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) ) / c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute it in terms of natural units, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be found without explicitly computing p, using the relation v = c * sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2 / E^2 ) ).

Yes, because gamma is E/(m c^2), so gamma = E/(m c²). Then, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = m c² / E.

So 1 - v²/c² = (m c² / E )^2.

So v^2 = c² (1 - (m c² / E )^2 )

So v = c * sqrt( 1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 )

That's a manageable formula.

So let's compute this.

But before that, let's compute the terms in terms of GeV and c.

Wait, but E and m are given in GeV, so perhaps we can compute the ratio (m c^2)/E. Since c is in m/s, but maybe it's easier to compute this ratio in terms without units, perhaps using E in GeV and m c^2 in GeV.

Because E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So (m c^2) / E = (1.2 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 1.2/8 = 0.15.

So (m c^2 / E )^2 is 0.15² = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So v = c * sqrt(0.9775) ≈ c * 0.9887.

Wait, because sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let me compute that precisely.

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Well, 0.9887 squared is approx 0.9775.

Yes, 0.9887 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.9775. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So velocity v is roughly 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, let's compute the lifetime τ.

We have τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, and ħ in what units? Let's make sure all units are consistent.

We need to compute τ in seconds.

So, Γ is 320 MeV. Let's convert that into joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 joules.

So 320 MeV is 320 million eV, which is 3.2e8 eV.

So Γ = 3.2e8 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

Hmm, let me compute:

3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 * 1.602) * 1e-11 = 5.1264 * 1e-11 J.

So Γ ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545
