Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what do I know about symmetries in physics?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let's break them down one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. That's the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions are Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT being an effective theory should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is a yes.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. If a theory has Poincare symmetry, it automatically includes Lorentz symmetry. But wait, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Well, the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT is built upon it, so I think SMEFT operators should respect Poincare as well. But wait, wait. SMEFT is constructed as a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories often have the same symmetries as the underlying theory. So the SM has Poincare, so SMEFT must respect it. So options 1 and 2 are both required. But wait, are all the SMEFT operators automatically Poincare invariant? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if the theory is built correctly, yes. So 2 is a yes as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Because the SMEFT is a low-energy theory, and sometimes when you add higher dimension operators, you have to ensure they're invariant under all the symmetries of the original theory. So yes, all operators must be Poincare invariant.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry, except for certain parts. Wait, actually, the SM has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then its effective theory shouldn't enforce it either. So SMEFT operators can violate CP, depending on the new physics. So operators aren't required to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Then, C
