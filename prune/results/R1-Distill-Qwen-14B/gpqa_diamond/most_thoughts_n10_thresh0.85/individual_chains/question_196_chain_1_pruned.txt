Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I probably can't use the classical equations directly.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max. In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed would be v = sqrt(kA^2/m), since the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v as sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C is probably not the correct answer.

Relativity comes into play because when speeds get close to the speed of light, the relativistic effects can't be ignored. So I need to think about how special relativity affects the equations of motion for this oscillator.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The correct expression for relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of the system would include both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², right? So the total energy E is the sum of the kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero. But wait, no, wait. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. When the mass passes through equilibrium (x=0), all potential is converted to kinetic. So in the classical case, that's when velocity is max.

But in the relativistic case, the energy isn't conserved in the same way because the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. Wait, or is it the total energy that's conserved? Let me think again.

Wait, the system's total energy includes the rest mass
