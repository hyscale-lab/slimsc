Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

So, the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. That's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is further away, its parallax is smaller. The formula is plx = 1/distance, but wait, in parsecs. So parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs.

So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Wait, so if I substitute that into the number of stars formula, N is proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 would be (1/r)^5.

Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Simplifying that, (1/(1/r^5)) is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That means as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. But wait, the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Oh, so it's the rate of change, like the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's asking about the dependence on r, not the rate of change. Because the options are all in terms of r raised to some power. So the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, so the answer would be option B, which is ~r^5.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Parallax plx is equal to 1/distance where distance is in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (r in parsecs). So when r increases, plx decreases.

Given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/r, gives N ∝ (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = r^5.

So N ∝ r^5. So for a given range of distance, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. So the correct option is B, which is ~r^5.

Wait, but wait another point. The question says "per unit range of distance, r." Does that mean the change in number per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr? Let me think.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the change in number per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. But the options include an r^4 option, which is option C.

Wait, now I'm confused. The wording of the question is a bit tricky. Let me re-read it.

The question is: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm. So maybe they're asking about the number per unit distance, which would involve the derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps they're asking how the number N depends on r. Because the way it's phrased could be ambiguous.

Wait, looking again: The original statement is "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/r, plx^5 = 1/r^5. So N = k * r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So the number increases with r^5. So per unit range, the number is proportional to r^5. Alternatively, if the question is about the rate at which the number changes with r, then it's about the derivative.

But the question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, perhaps it's the number per unit distance. So the number per unit distance would be N/(delta r), or perhaps the number per unit r, which would be the derivative.

Wait, actually, the way the question is worded, if the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5, and parallax is inversely proportional to r, then N is proportional to r^5. So when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you observe increases as r^5 as you go further out. So the dependence is r^5, which is option B.

But if the question is about how the number changes per unit distance, that's the derivative, which is proportional to r^4. So the change in N per unit r is dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the question is asking about N as a function of r or dN/dr as a function of r. The question says, "how does the number ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" To me, "change with" might imply the rate, i.e., derivative. So dN/dr ∝ r^4.

But I'm getting conflicting interpretations.

Let me think again: The number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Parallax plx = 1/r. So N = k * (r^5). So if you go from r to r+Δr, the number of stars increases by N(r+Δr) - N(r) = k [ (r+Δr)^5 - r^5 ].

But the question is about per unit distance, so perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance. That would be the density, which would be dN/dr.

So dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So that would be option C.

Wait, but the initial statement says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So that's the total number of stars in a region, not per unit volume. Wait, but wait, perhaps the region is a thin shell at distance r. So when you're considering stars at a particular distance, the number you see depends on the solid angle and the volume.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's model the scenario.

The number of stars observed in a region of the sky is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But how does plx relate to distance? plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx.

So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5, where d is the distance in parsecs.

But the question is about how N changes with d (distance). So if N ∝ d^5, then N increases with the fifth power of distance. So the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative, which is proportional to d^4. But the question's wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" I think they're asking for how the total number of stars varies with distance. So N ∝ r^5. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, if it's the number per unit distance, then it's dN/dr = 5r^4, so the answer would be C. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the volume element. Wait, but the volume element in spherical shells is 4π r^2 dr. So if the number of stars depends on the volume, but the question says N varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about flux or density.

Another approach: The number of stars observed in a certain direction is related to their density and distance. But the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is about the number of stars per unit area in the sky, which depends on distance. The number per unit area would be the surface density, which depends on the volume of the sphere up to distance r, and the density of stars.

Wait, assuming the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a distance r would be proportional to r^3 (since volume is r^3), but the question is about how the number per unit area (i.e., surface density) in the sky changes with distance. But perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, no, the question states that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N = k / plx^5.

So if N is the number of stars per unit area, and since plx = 1/d, then N = k d^5.

But wait, that would imply that the surface density increases as d^5, which seems a bit high. But according to the question, that's the given.

So if N = k d^5, then the number of stars per unit area is proportional to d^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars per unit area you observe increases as the fifth power.

But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the region is a thin shell at distance r, so the number of stars in that shell is proportional to r^5 multiplied by the area of the shell. The area of a shell is 4π r^2.

Wait, but the number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, so N ∝ r^5. So if the shell's area is 4π r^2, then the number of stars in the shell would be N_shell = N * 4π r^2 = (k r^5) * (4π r^2) ) = k' r^7.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the number of stars in the shell increase with r^7, which is not an option given.

Alternatively, perhaps N is the number of stars per unit area, so the total number in the shell is N * 4π r^2. If N ∝ r^5, then the total would be 4π k r^5 * r^2 = 4π k r^7, which again isn't matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let's go back. The question says that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = k r^5.

So the number of stars in that region is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the correct option is B, which is ~ r^5.

But then the question's wording adds "(per unit range of distance, r)". Wait, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 k r^4, which would mean the answer is C, ~ r^4.

But now I'm really confused about what the question is asking. Let me think about the wording again. The question is: "How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" The phrase "change with distance" could imply the functional dependence, so N is proportional to r^5. However, "per unit range" might imply that it's the number in a small range, which would be the derivative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model an example. Suppose r is the distance. If the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, then for a small change dr, the number of stars added would be dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 k r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So that would be option C.

Alternatively, if you have a range of distance dr, the number of stars in that range is proportional to r^5 * dr, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, no, if N is the number of stars in a region of the sky, perhaps the region is a thin shell at distance r, so the number of stars in that shell (per unit distance) would be dN/dr. So if N(r) = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., how many stars you encounter as you move a unit distance) increases with r^4.

But I'm not sure whether the question is asking about the total number or the density. The original statement says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps it's the total number in the region, not per unit area or per unit volume.

Wait, maybe the region is a specific area on the sky, so as you look further away, the number of stars in that area increases as r^5. So for a given area, as you look further, more stars are present, which would suggest N is proportional to r^5, so B is correct.

But I'm getting stuck. Since the options are given, I think the correct approach is to note that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5, which is option B. So the answer should be B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

Thus, the total number of stars in the region of the sky is proportional to \( r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars "changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \))". This phrasing could imply either the total number of stars as a function of \( r \) or the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to \( r \) (i.e., the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \)).

1. **If the question refers to the total number of stars as a function of \( r \):**  
   Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the number of stars increases with the fifth power of \( r \). This corresponds to option **B**.

2. **If the question refers to the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance:**  
   The derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
   \]  
   This implies that the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

However, the question explicitly states that the number of stars "varies with parallax as \( 1/\text{plx}^5 \)", which directly translates to \( N \propto r^5 \). The phrasing "per unit range of distance, \( r \)" does not explicitly require interpreting the derivative. Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation is that the total number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \), making the correct answer **B**.

Answer: B
