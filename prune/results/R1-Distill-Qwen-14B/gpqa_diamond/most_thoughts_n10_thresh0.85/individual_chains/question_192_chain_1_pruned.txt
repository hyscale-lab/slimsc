Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is a bit tricky. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; instead, its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s (the displacement between the two centers) is theta.

Hmm. I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, I think the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right, the cavity is conducting? Wait, no, the problem says it's a conductor with a cavity. So the conductor itself is a conductor, but the cavity is empty except for the charge.

Wait, more details: the conductor is uncharged initially. When you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q due to electrostatic induction. But the conductor was neutral, so the outer surface must then have a charge +q to balance it out. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q and the outer has +q.

But wait, no. Wait, no, because the conductor is a single piece. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q, right. Because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer charges: -q (inner) + outer = 0. So outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor is a single sphere? No, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity. So the conductor's material is a shell, but wait, no, a
