Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level in star 1 is higher, which probably relates to temperature. I think a higher temperature would lead to more excitation since the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can reach higher energy levels.

The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Maybe that's relevant here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 (for star_1) is 2 * n2 (for star_2). Let me think about the setup. Let's denote star_1 as having energy level E2 and star_2 as having E1. Wait, no, perhaps both stars have the same energy levels, but different temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think of each star as having its own photospheric temperature, T1 and T2. For each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to a lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the excited state as level 2 and the ground state as level 1. For star_1, the ratio n2/n1 = 2 (since twice as excited). For star_2, the ratio is n2’/n1’ = let's say x. But wait, the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So maybe if the excited state is n2, then for star_1, n2/n1 = 2, and for star_2, n2/n1 is something else. Wait, no, the question says specifically that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, no, I think I misinterpreted. The statement says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the occupation number for that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each, the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both stars (since they're the same atoms), so their ratio would be same. So the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, perhaps it's something else
