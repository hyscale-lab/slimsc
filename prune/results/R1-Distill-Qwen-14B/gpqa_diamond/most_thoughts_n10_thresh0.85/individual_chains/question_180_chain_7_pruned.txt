Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy comes into play here. Let me try to break it down.

So, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the problem says 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. Interesting.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But wait, are they arranged in some specific way? Like, are they all on the same point 2m away from P, or spread out? Because that would affect the potential energy.

Hmm, but the problem says it's an isolated system, and we're looking for the minimum energy. I think the minimal potential energy would occur when the charges are as close together as possible. Wait, but in this case, they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So maybe their positions relative to each other don't matter because they're fixed at that distance. Or perhaps, since they're all at the same point 2m away from P, they're all at the same location, leading to repulsion between themselves.

Wait
