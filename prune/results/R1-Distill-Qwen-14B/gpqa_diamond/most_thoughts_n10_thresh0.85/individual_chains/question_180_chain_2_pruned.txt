Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about electrostatic potential energy. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each charge is twice the elementary charge, right? I remember that e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So, each charge would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But wait, since all the particles are identical, maybe I'll just keep it as 2e for now and plug in the value later.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, the setup is that one charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the potential energy between charges. Since potential energy is a state function, the minimum energy would probably be when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their repulsion. But wait, in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, so their positions are fixed relative to the 13th charge.

Wait, but all charges have the same sign because each is 2e. So, they all repel each other. To find the potential energy of the system, I think we need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated, the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m away. So, the 12 charges are all at a distance r = 2m from the 13th. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because they're all at the same distance from P, but they are located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, but they are also at some varying distances from each other.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but doesn't specify how they are arranged around P. If they're all on a sphere, the distances between each
