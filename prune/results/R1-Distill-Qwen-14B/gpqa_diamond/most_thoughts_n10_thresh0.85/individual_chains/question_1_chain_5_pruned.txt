Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, the two energies won't overlap in their probability distributions.

So, the energy difference ΔE (E2-E1) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

I remember that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, then ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. That's about 6.58e-7 eV.

For E2: τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 ≈ (6.582e-16)/(1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV. So around 6.58e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for E1 and E2, respectively.

Wait, so which one is larger? E1's uncertainty is larger, 6.58e-7 eV. So the difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV for them to be clearly distinguished. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states are resolvable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 6.58e-7. So that's too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No good.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's way larger than 6.58e-7. So that would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is just about the same as E2's uncertainty. But wait, the difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty. So 1e-8 is equal to E2's uncertainty, but not larger than E1's uncertainty which is 6.58e-7. So 1e-8 is less than 6.58e-7, so the difference would be too small to resolve E1 and E2.

Wait wait, wait. The energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty, but which uncertainty? Because the states may have different uncertainties.

In reality, to resolve two states, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Oh, because each has their own uncertainty. So the combined uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Let me think. Suppose you have two states with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2. The energy difference is ΔE. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, perhaps.

So let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2:

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV
ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV

Sum = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.24e-7. So option C is more than enough.

Other options: option A is 1e-9, way too small. Option D is 1e-8, which is larger than ΔE2 but smaller than ΔE1. So 1e-8 < 6.58e-7, so the difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, so not resolvable.

So the only option that's sufficiently larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C.

Wait a second, but why can't the energy difference be just larger than the larger individual uncertainty?

Because when you measure the energy, the uncertainty comes from each state. So if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, it would make the two states' energy ranges not overlap. Because each has their own uncertainty.

Wait, but consider the case where E2 is higher than E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1, so E1 is in [E1 - ΔE1/2, E1 + ΔE1/2]. Similarly, E2 is
