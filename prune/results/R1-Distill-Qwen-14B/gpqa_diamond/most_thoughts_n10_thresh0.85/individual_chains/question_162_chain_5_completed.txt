Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that seems a bit strange. So, it's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx² and dy². So maybe it's describing a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, like a pseudosphere.

I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (but wait, pseudosphere is a different concept) might have a different formula. Wait, no, a pseudosphere isn't a sphere; it's more like a surface with infinite extent but finite area. Oh, right, like how a pseudosphere has finite area but infinite perimeter or something like that.

But wait, this question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, what's the area formula for a pseudosphere? I think the standard pseudosphere has a certain area, maybe related to pi and the radius. Oh wait, wait. I think the formula for the area of a pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid) is 4π r² times something? Or wait, no. Wait, the regular sphere has area 4π r². But pseudosphere is different. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the given metric and find the area from that. Because sometimes the question gives you the metric, you can compute the area directly.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So this is in two dimensions, with coordinates x and y. The area element in such a metric is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. But in this case, since the off-diagonal terms (g_xy) are zero (the metric is diagonal), the area element simplifies to sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. Wait, no, more accurately, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since it's diagonal, det(g) = g_xx * g_yy. So the area element dA is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy.

In this metric, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), same as g_yy. So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So sqrt of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area would be the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So, the domain of x and y is where 4 - x² - y² > 0. Because if it's zero or negative, the denominator would be zero or negative, making the metric singular or imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So, the domain is x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area integral becomes ∫∫ [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy, over x² + y² < 4.

Hmm, how do I compute this integral? Let's switch to polar coordinates since the domain is a circle. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, the θ integral is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so the integral over θ is 2π. So:

Area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me set u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r. So -du/2 = r dr.

Wait, the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²).

Substituting u = 4 - r², du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is 32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du ].

The integral of 1/u du is ln|u|. So:

32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

Wait, let's compute the limits. When u goes from 4 to 0, the integral is ln(0) - ln(4). But ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, wait, but wait: evaluating ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du is same as ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du but with a negative sign. Because when you reverse the limits, the integral changes sign.

Wait, let's think again. The integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) * [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

Which is (-32/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-16) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is -infty - a finite number, which is -infty. So the expression becomes (-16) [ -infty - ln4 ] = (-16) * (-infty) = positive infty times 16, which is positive infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere should have finite area. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's redo the integral without substitution.

The integral is ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²).

Let me make substitution u=4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-du/2) ).

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

But ∫(4 to 0) (1/u) du = - ∫(0 to4) (1/u) du = - [ ln u ] from 0 to4 = - [ ln4 - ln0 ].

But ln0 is -infty, so ln4 - (-infty) is infty. So, - [ infty ] → -infty.

Wait, but the integral ∫(4 to0) (1/u) du is the same as - ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = - [ ln4 - ln0 ].

Wait, ln0 is negative infinity, so ln4 is finite. So, ln4 - (-infty) = infty. So, the integral becomes -infty.

Wait, that can't be right. So let's compute it step by step.

The integral ∫ (from a to b) 1/u du is ln(b) - ln(a). So when a approaches zero from the positive side, ln(a) approaches negative infinity. So, ∫ (from 0 to 4) 1/u du = ln4 - ln0 = ln4 - (-infty) = ∞. So, ∫ (4 to 0) 1/u du = - ∫ (0 to4 ) 1/u du = -infty.

So putting it all together:

32 * (-1/2) * [ ∫(4 to 0) 1/u du ] = 32 * (-1/2) * (-infty) = 32 * (infty/2) ) → 16 * infty → infty.

Wait, that implies the area is infinite. But wait, the pseudosphere should have finite area. So am I making a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the metric is actually for a pseudosphere embedded in a space with a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the given metric is for a finite area because the curvature is negative, but the integral suggests it's infinite. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the metric given might represent a hyperbolic plane. Because hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but maybe this is a specific model. Wait, the metric here is conformally flat. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²/k²), or something like that. Oh, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So, the denominator is 4 - r². So if r² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. So the region is x²+y² <4. Wait, but that's a finite region. So if the coordinates are confined to a circle of radius 2, perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but the integral I computed suggested that the area is infinite. So that would mean that the area is infinite, which would make the correct answer option D) +infty.

But wait, I thought a pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing the pseudosphere (tractricoid) which is a finite area surface, and the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, the tractricoid is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it has finite area. So maybe the area should be finite, but according to the calculation, the area from the metric is infinite. That's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't for a tractricoid but for a hyperbolic plane. Because when you look at the metric, when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the curvature becomes infinite. But in reality, hyperbolic space is usually represented with an infinite area. So perhaps the given metric is a model of hyperbolic space, but in a finite coordinate patch.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a different kind of surface. So, if the integral of the area element gives infinity, then the area is infinite, which would make the answer D.

But wait, why is the area infinite? Because the denominator is 4 - r², and as r approaches 2, the area element becomes large. So the integral near r=2 would diverge, leading to an infinite area.

So maybe the correct answer is D) +infty.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, so that's the choice.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element associated with this metric. The area element in a metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of \(x\) and \(y\) is where the metric is defined, i.e., \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This is a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over this region:

\[
A = \int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integral is straightforward, yielding \(2\pi\). The remaining radial integral is:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), where \(du = -2r \, dr\). This gives \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
A = -32\pi \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
A = 32\pi \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 32\pi \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the term \(\ln 4 - \ln 0 \to \infty\). Therefore, the area diverges to infinity:

\[
A = +\infty.
\]

This result indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. Thus, the correct answer is:
