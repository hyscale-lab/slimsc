Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to figure out the reagents (A and B) from the given options. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so first, I'll break down each reaction. Let's start with the first one: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, when a ketone reacts with CN- (cyanide ion), what's the typical reaction? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile here.

In a nucleophilic addition to a ketone, the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl oxygen then gets a negative charge, which gets protonated. Then, the mechanism usually involves the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. But wait, after that, what happens? Well, in the case of adding HCN or NaCN to a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol, but wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait a minute, that product has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That's interesting. So, I'm thinking that the cyanide added to the carbonyl, but then maybe there's some kind of elimination or perhaps the hydroxyl group is being converted into something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the initial addition would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN- after the attack, but wait, the actual product has both the hydroxyl and the nitrile on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to (CH3)2C(O-)CN^(-) Na^+ . Then, during work-up, maybe this becomes a ketone cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation. So the product after adding HCN to a ketone is a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a hydroxyl and nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, in a ketone's cyanohydrin, the CN and OH are on the same carbon. Because when HCN adds to a ketone, the mechanism is that the H+ of HCN adds to the carbonyl O, making it a better leaving group, then the CN- attacks the carbonyl C, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water or another proton source would protonate the oxygen, and then the O-H would form, and the leaving group would be H2O. Wait, but in the case of NaCN, which is a source of CN- but not HCN. So maybe in this case, the reaction uses an acid catalyst?

Ah, right. The addition of HCN or CN- to a ketone often requires an acid catalyst. Because the H+ from the acid would protonate the carbonyl O, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which speeds up the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst (H3O+) to form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but let me look at the options. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm not sure when that's used. Wait, sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the benzoin condensation or in the hydroxyamination? Or wait, maybe it's used in the addition of hydrosulfites to carbonyl groups, like in the formation of alcohols.

Wait, no. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which can act as a nucleophile. So if NaHSO3 is present, perhaps in a reaction with a ketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution involving HCN.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution; they undergo addition. So I think the first reaction is an addition of CN- to the ketone, which requires an acid catalyst, H3O+. So A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, let's see which ones have A as H3O+. Options A and B have A as H3O+, whereas C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So I think A is H3O+, so options A or B. Now, the second part.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the reactants and products, the nitrile group (CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. So the reagent B must be an oxidizing agent that can oxidize a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile attached to a carbon that's next to a hydroxyl group. So, the compound is R-C(OH)-CN. So when oxidized, the CN becomes a COOH group, making R-C(OH)-COOH. Hmm, but wait, the product is R-C(OH)-COOH, meaning the nitrile is oxidized to the acid.

Wait, but oxidizing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid usually requires strong oxidizing conditions. Nitriles are typically oxidized with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizers like H2O2 under basic conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent B
