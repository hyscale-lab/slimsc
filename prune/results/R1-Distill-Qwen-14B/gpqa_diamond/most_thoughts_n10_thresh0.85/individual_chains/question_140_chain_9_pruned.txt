Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these kinds of questions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its close analog.

Hmm, I need to figure out what X is. Let's start by thinking about the reaction. When X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. Gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So possible gases could be something like CO2 (but wait, that's 12 (C) and 16 (O), but wait, same protons and neutrons... Let me see. Oh, wait, for gas W, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So each molecule of W has the same number of n and p. So possible molecules could be something where the atomic number equals the neutron count. For example, H2O has 1 proton and 1 neutron in each H, but that's not a molecule. Wait, maybe CO2? No, because C has 6 protons and O has 8. Wait, maybe it's something like O2? No, O has 8 protons each, 8 neutrons each? Wait, no, that's for O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 neutrons per O atom, but in the molecule, each O has 8. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. Or is it per atom? Or total? The wording says the molecule contains same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, molecules are made of atoms. So for the entire molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's something like H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons in H2O would be 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8. So total neutrons would be 0 +8=8. No, that's not equal. So not H2O.

Wait, maybe CO2? C is 6 protons, O is 8 each. So molecule has 6 + 16=22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 16=22 neutrons. Oh! Because 6 (from C) + 16 (each O has 8, two O's make 16) =22. So total protons 22, total neutrons 22. That fits. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. So W is CO2?

But wait, another possibility: Could it be CH4? Let's check. CH4 has C (6p) and H (1p each, 4 H's). Total protons:6 +4=10. Neutrons: C is 6, H has 0. So total neutrons: 6. 10 ≠6, so no.

What about N2? Each N has 7p. So molecule has 14p. Neutrons: each N has 7n, so 14. So 14=14. Oh, that would also fit. So W could be N2. But when you think about the reaction, is N2 a likely product?

Alternatively, maybe W is CO, which has 1 C and 1 O. Protons:6+8=14. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 (assuming O-16). So 6+8=14. So 14 each. So CO would fit as well.

Wait, but looking at the precipitate G which, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so a solid that melts near 4 C. What's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Wait, another thought: if G is a precipitate, maybe it's a hydroxide? Or a carbonate?

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) to form precipitate G and release gas W. If W is CO2, then perhaps Y is an acid and X is a carbonate? Or X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. Let me think.

Wait, but X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is something like Sodium (Na) having a heavier isotope, like Na-23, but wait, Na is usually Na-23, which is stable. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the question says that a keto acid reacts with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group, like acetone, but maybe it's reacting with something like a base.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has two O atoms. So the product could be something like the keto acid being deprotonated or perhaps forming an ester or something. But if two O's, perhaps an acetylation? Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the reaction where X reacts with Y. Y is liquid. Possible liquids: water, perhaps an acid like H2SO4, HCl, etc. If X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with HCl (liquid Y) would produce CO2 (W), NaCl, and water. But then precipitate G, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH (a solid), reacting with HCl (liquid Y) would produce NaCl (soluble) and water. But that would just be dissolution, maybe no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double displacement. Let's think, perhaps Y is an acid, X is a sulfide. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, another point: when G is heated, it releases B. Which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think about what solid melts at around that temperature. For example, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is about 4°C. So B is probably water? Or another substance. Wait, another thought: Maybe B is sodium hydroxide, which has a melting point around 318°C, which is higher. Wait, maybe
