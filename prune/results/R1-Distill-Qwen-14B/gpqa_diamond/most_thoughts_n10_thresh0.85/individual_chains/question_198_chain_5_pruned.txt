Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think Co(SCN)_2 is the blue one. So we're looking for the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 complexes.

Stability constants are for the formation of complexes. The general formula for a metal-ligand complex is M + nL ↔ MLn, and the stability constant beta is [MLn]/([M][L]^n). So higher beta means more stable complex.

Our job is to find out the distribution of the different Co(SCN) species. The possible complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. Each has a different stability constant.

But wait, the given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So wait, that's β1 for the first complex (monomeric?), then β2 for the second, up to β4 for the fourth. Or maybe the order is different? Oh, I think the stability constants are in order of the complex: β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, β4 for Co(SCN)_4.

But wait, the beta values may be for each step. Like, β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 is the formation of the second from the first, etc. Or wait, no, in some cases, the stability constant for the overall complex is the product of the stepwise constants. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m is given as βn. So each βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

Hmm, but I think more accurately, for the
