Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The setup is a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are provided as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. 

Wait, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it indicates a greater tendency to form. So the order of stability for these complexes would be: β3 is the highest, then β2, then β4, and β1 is the least. Hmm, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about the order. Let me think: β3 is 63, β2 is 40, β4 is 16, β1 is 9. So yeah, the most stable is the third complex, then second, then fourth, then first.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands. So I'm guessing that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second complex. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+), and [Co(SCN)_4]^(4-), right? So the blue one is the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). So the question is asking for the percentage of this species compared to all possible Co species.

So to find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up, then find what fraction is the second one.

But how do I calculate the fraction of each complex? I remember that the fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand. The general approach is to use the stepwise formation constants and calculate the distribution of the species.

Wait, I think the formula involves the fraction of each species. The fraction of each complex depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

Alternatively, I've heard of the method where you calculate the concentration of each complex relative to the total. Let me think. The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n * [Co] * [SCN^-]^n) / (denominator)

where the denominator is the sum over all species of (β_k * [Co] * [SCN^-]^k) for k = 0 to 4.

Wait, no, the denominator should be the sum of all the terms for each complex. So for each complex k, the term is β_k * [Co]^(1) * [SCN^-]^k, because each complex is [Co(SCN)_k]^(1−k), I think. Wait, no, the metal is Co^2+ and each SCN^- is -1. So the charge would be 2+ + k*(-1) = 2−k+. So the complexes would have charges accordingly. But maybe that's not directly relevant for this calculation.

Wait, another approach. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the possible complexes. So [Co]total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) + [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+) + [Co(SCN)_4]^(4-). But each of these is related to the free Co^2+ and the ligand SCN^-.

The stability constant for each complex is defined as β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^(n+1)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct. For the nth complex, which is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, the stability constant is:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So β_n = [complex] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So the concentration of each complex can be written as [complex] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But the total concentration of Co is [Co^2+] + sum of all [complexes]. So:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4.

So, [Co_total] = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Let me denote [Co^2+] as C. So,

C_total = C [1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4 ]

where s is [SCN^-].

We can solve for C:

C = C_total / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4 )

Once we have C, the concentration of each complex is β_n * C * s^n.

So for each n, [complex_n] = β_n * C * s^n.

Then, the fraction of each complex is [complex_n] / [Co_total], which is (β_n C s^n ) / (C_total )

But since C_total = [Co_total] = C*(sum terms), the fraction becomes (β_n s^n ) / (sum terms )

So the fraction f_n = (β_n s^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k s^k )

But wait, when n=0, β0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] = β0 [Co^2+][SCN]^0 ), so the denominator is sum_{k=0}^4 β_k s^k with β0=1.

Wait, the denominator is sum_{k=0}^4 β_k s^k.

So for each n, f_n = (β_n s^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k s^k )

So for the problem, the percentages are calculated based on these fractions.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the second complex, which is n=2, so [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+).

So first, let's compute s, which is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator:

sum = β0 s^0 + β1 s^1 + β2 s^2 + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4

But wait, β0 is 1 because β0 = [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN]^0) = 1.

So sum = 1 + β1*s + β2*s² + β3*s^3 + β4*s^4.

Let's compute each term step by step.

Given s = 0.1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute:

Term0 = β0 s^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

Term1 = β1 s = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term2 = β2 s² =40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

Term3 = β3 s^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001= 0.063.

Term4 = β4 s^4=16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all terms:

sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me add them up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 + 0.4 =2.3

2.3 + 0.063=2.363

2.363 + 0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator sum is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for the second complex (n=2) is:

f_2 = (β2 s²) / sum = (40 * 0.01)/2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Hmm, 0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 is approximately 2.3646, and 0.4 is 0.4.

Let me compute this: 0.4 ÷ 2.3646 ≈ ?

I can do it step by step.

2.3646 × 0.169 = approximately 0.4?

Wait, let me compute 2.3646 × 0.169.

2 * 0.169=0.338.

0.3646 *0.169: 0.3*0.169=0.0507, 0.0646 *0.169≈0.01096, so total ≈0.06166.

So total approx 0.338 + 0.06166 = 0.39966. That's close to 0.4.

So 0.169 gives approximately 0.39966, which is very close to 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. The dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), which is the second complex, n=2. So the fraction is 16.9%, which would correspond to option D.

But let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

So let me compute each term again:

Term0: 1.

Term1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, f2 = (40 * 0.01)/2.3646 = 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options have option D as 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because I thought the most stable complex is the third one. But in this calculation, the highest fraction seems to be for n=2.

Wait, let's think about the fractions for each species:

Let me compute each f_n:

f0 = β0 s^0 / sum = (1 *1)/2.3646 ≈0.423 → 42.3% as free Co^2+.

f1 = (9 *0.1)/2.3646=0.9/2.3646≈0.381 → 38.1% as [CoSCN]^+.

f2 = 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 → 16.9% as [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+).

f3=63*(0.1)^3= 0.063 /2.3646≈0.0266 → ~2.66%.

f4=16*(0.1)^4=0.0016 /2.3646≈0.000677 → ~0.0677%.

So the dominant species is free Co^2+ (42.3%), then [CoSCN]^+ (38.1%), then [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) (16.9%), and the rest are negligible.

So the percentage for dithiocyanato is about 16.9%, so option D.

Wait, but the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". I'm a bit unsure if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or another one. Because sometimes different Co complexes can be blue. But according to the problem statement, the blue is the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex.

So, yes, the answer is 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^(2+)) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and concentrations provided. The stability constant for each complex is defined as:

\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:

\[
[\text{Co}_{\text{total}}] = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Let \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = C \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = s = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The total cobalt concentration can be expressed as:

\[
[\text{Co}_{\text{total}}] = C \left( 1 + \beta_1 s + \beta_2 s^2 + \beta_3 s^3 + \beta_4 s^4 \right)
\]

The fraction of each species is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n s^n}{1 + \beta_1 s + \beta_2 s^2 + \beta_3 s^3 + \beta_4 s^4}
\]

For the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^(2+)), \( n = 2 \). Substituting the given stability constants (\( \beta_1 = 9, \beta_2 = 40, \beta_3 = 63, \beta_4 = 16 \)) and \( s = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), we calculate each term in the denominator:

\[
\text{Term}_0 = 1, \quad \text{Term}_1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad \text{Term}_2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \quad \text{Term}_3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \quad \text{Term}_4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016
\]

The sum of these terms is:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 s^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \approx 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
