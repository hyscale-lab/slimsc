Alright, so I have this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. I remember that for a particle to decay into other particles, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, the rest mass of X is 6 GeV, which means any decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Actually, each decay product must have a mass less than half of X's mass because in the rest frame, each particle would need energy including its rest mass. Oh, right, because if X is at rest, the two decay products must each have energy. So, for a decay into two particles, each must have a rest mass less than or equal to (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a rest mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Now, let's think about the fermions available. The fermions in the Standard Model are leptons and quarks. For each fermion f, the decay would be X → f f̄.

So, possible fermions f could be quarks or leptons. But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is with ψ_f, which suggests that X couples to fermions f. The coupling here would probably determine which fermions X can decay into. But the question doesn't specify any coupling suppression, so I think we can assume that X can decay into any fermion it can couple to, as long as the mass allows it.

So, let's list all possible fermions f and their masses:

Leptons:
- e⁻: ~0.511 MeV (so 0.000511 GeV)
- μ⁻: ~105.7 MeV (0.1057 GeV)
- τ⁻: ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but each quark comes in pairs, so X would decay into quark-antiquark pairs. But wait, the up and down quarks have very small masses. So for each fermion pair, the combined mass would be twice the mass of the fermion. So for example, e+ e- would have a combined mass of about 1.022 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. Similarly for mu, tau, and quarks.

But when considering decay into quarks, the mass of the quark itself is the rest mass. But in reality, in particle physics, the rest mass of the hadrons (like pions) is much higher. Wait, but in this case, X is a boson decaying into fermions. So the decay would be into a quark and antiquark, but those are not bound into hadrons. Wait, no, because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with the fermion fields, so the decay would produce the fermion-antifermion pair directly, not hadrons. But wait, in reality, a boson can't decay into free quarks because they are confined. Oh wait, but in the context of this problem, maybe they're considering that X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs, even though in reality that's not possible because they can't exist freely. Hmm, maybe the question is more of a theoretical one, ignoring confinement.

Assuming that the decay into quarks is allowed for the sake of this question, then which quarks can X decay into?

Each quark has a mass. So for X→ f f̄, the sum of their masses must be ≤ m_X. But wait, in the center of mass frame, the energy available is m_X. Each particle must have energy ≥ their rest mass. But when a particle decays into two particles, each must have energy at least their rest mass, so the sum of their rest masses must be ≤ m_X. Because in the rest frame, each particle would have energy E = (m_X^2 + m_f^2 + m_f^2 )/(2 m_X ), something like that. Wait, no, let me think. For two-body decay, each particle's energy is (m_X^2 + m_f^2) / (2 m_X).

But each particle's rest mass must be ≤ m_X / 2. Because if m_f > m_X /2, then even if the other particle is massless, the first particle's rest mass would require m_X > 2 m_f. So for each fermion f, 2 m_f ≤ m_X.

So for each fermion, m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

Given m_X =6 GeV, so m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Leptons:
- e: 0.511 MeV → yes
- μ: 105.7 MeV → yes
- τ: 1.78 GeV → yes (since 1.78 < 3)
- Any others? No, the other leptons are neutrinos, which are massless (or have negligible mass, so we can ignore).

Quarks:

- u: ~2.2 MeV → yes
- d: ~4.7 MeV → yes
- s: ~100 MeV → yes (0.1 GeV <3 GeV)
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes (1.5 <3)
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3, so no
- t: way too heavy, so no.

So, the fermions that X can decay into (in pairs) are:

Leptons: e, μ, τ
Quarks: u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the top quark is way too heavy, so no. Bottom is also too heavy (4.5 GeV >3 GeV), so can't decay into b or t.

So possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-
X → μ+ μ-
X → τ+ τ-
X → u ū
X → d d̄
X → s s̄
X → c c̄

Wait, but the options don't have all these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, why is b included here? Because the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So can't decay into b.

So option A includes b which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

That makes sense. Because c is 1.5 GeV, which is ≤3.

Option B includes all the allowed fermions except for top and bottom. So that should be correct.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ-, etc.

But t is 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV, so can't be. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b̄..., which is wrong for the same reason as A.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The interaction term is written as L = -λf ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y).

Wait, so ψf is a fermion field. The term would imply that X couples to the fermion f. So, the possible fermions f are those that are present in the Lagrangian. But the question says "the interaction between bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so I suppose X can interact with all fermions, but only when their mass allows the decay.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with the fermion field ψf. So, each fermion f in the theory would have a term like this, so X can decay into any fermion f for which the mass allows. So the possible decays are all the allowed fermions, as I thought.

So from the options, only option B includes all the allowed leptons and quarks except the ones with m_f >3 GeV.

Wait, let me check option B again.

Option B says: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermion pairs have m_f ≤3 GeV. So X can decay into any of them.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the rest mass of the fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), or equivalently, \( m_f \leq \frac{m_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the energy of each decay product is sufficient in the rest frame of \( X \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
1. **Leptons**:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( b \bar{b} \): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed.
   - \( t \bar{t} \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
