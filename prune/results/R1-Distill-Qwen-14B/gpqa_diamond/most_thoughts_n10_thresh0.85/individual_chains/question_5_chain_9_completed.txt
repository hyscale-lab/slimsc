Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the operator is P, which is a vector operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often correspond to components of angular momentum or similar observables. The direction in question is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it's a two-dimensional direction but not the y-axis. That probably means the eigenvector is an eigenstate of P along direction n.

The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So I'm looking for an eigenvector with this eigenvalue. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2), the eigenvector should be a two-component spinor.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P. Let me list them out again:

- Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
- Py is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.
- Pz is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

So the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be something like P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator P would be along that direction. So the operator we're interested in is P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator P along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me denote n_x as cos(theta) and n_z as sin(theta), but wait, since it's in the x-z plane, perhaps theta is the angle made with the x-axis? Or maybe it's the polar angle in spherical coordinates. Hmm, but direction in x-z plane is like a direction in the x-z plane, so the angle is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So yes, n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta), and since it's in x-z plane, phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero.

Wait no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So if the particle is moving in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle phi is 0 (or 180, etc.), but theta would be between 0 and 180 degrees. But perhaps this doesn't matter here because the problem is general.

But for our purposes, n is a unit vector, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P_n = (n_x) P_x + (n_z) P_z.

Given that P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices, substituting them in would give:

P_n = (n_x) (ħ/2) σ_x + (n_z) (ħ/2) σ_z.

So P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, wait, the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So the equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting P_n into the equation:

(ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so we get:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Let me denote the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) as a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute that.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

n_x σ_x = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding these together gives the matrix:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So our matrix equation is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me write this out as equations. Let |ψ> = [a; b], then:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Rewriting the first equation:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Wait, the first equation is n_z a + n_x b = a, which can be rewritten as (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

The second equation is n_x a - n_z b = b, which becomes n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0.

Hmm, so we have a system of two equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1 ) b = 0

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients matrix must be zero. Let me write the coefficients:

[ (n_z - 1)   n_x ]
[ n_x          (-n_z -1) ]

The determinant is (n_z - 1)(-n_z -1) - n_x^2 = 0.

Let me compute this:

= ( -n_z^2 - n_z + n_z + 1 ) - n_x^2 = (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = -(n_z^2 + n_x^2) +1.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, substituting:

= -(1) +1 =0.

So the determinant is zero, which is consistent, because we're looking for eigenvalues.

But actually, we can perhaps find a non-trivial solution by solving the equations. Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

We can solve for b in terms of a:

n_x b = -(n_z -1) a → b = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.

But wait, n_x can't be zero? Because if n_x is zero, then the direction is along z, and the operator is just P_z. Let me consider that case separately, but for now, assuming n_x is not zero.

So substituting into the second equation:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

But from the first equation, b = (1 -n_z)/n_x * a.

Substituting:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) [ (1 -n_z)/n_x a ] = 0.

Factor out a and n_x:

a [ n_x + ( (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) ) / n_x ] =0.

Since a is not zero (non-trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

Compute the numerator:

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) =0.

Expand (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z):

= (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)

= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 +n_z

= n_z^2 -1.

So the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1 ) =0 → n_x^2 +n_z^2 -1=0.

But n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, so 1-1=0 → 0=0.

So the equation is satisfied for any a, as expected. Therefore, the two equations are dependent, and the solution is determined by the first equation: b = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] a.

So the eigenvector can be written as a [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ].

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.

We have:

From equation 1: (n_z-1) a +n_x b =0 → n_x b = (1 -n_z) a → b = [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] a.

So the vector is [a; b] = a [1, (1 -n_z)/n_x ].

But a can be any scalar, so we can set a=1 for simplicity, giving [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ].

But wait, let's test this.

Suppose n is along x: n_z=0, n_x=1.

Then, the vector becomes [1; (1-0)/1 ] = [1;1]. Let's see if that's an eigenvector for P_x.

P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x → [[0,1],[1,0]].

So P_x [1;1] = [1;1], which is correct, as Pauli X |+x> = |+x>, with eigenvalue +1 (when scaled by ħ/2).

Another test: if n is along z, then n_x=0. Wait, but earlier I assumed n_x is not zero. If n_x is zero, then how does that work?

Wait, if n_x is zero (n is along z), then the operator P_n = P_z. The eigenvalue equation for P_z is P_z |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So P_z has eigenstates |+z> = [1;0] and |-z> = [0;1], with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So in this case, n_x=0, and the direction is along z. Then, our earlier approach would have n_x=0, which would cause division by zero in the solution. So perhaps I should handle this as a special case.

But for the general case, let's proceed.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ].

But we need to normalize it.

Compute the normalization factor. The vector is [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ].

The norm squared is 1^2 + [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ]^2 = 1 + (1 -n_z)^2 / n_x^2.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2.

So let me compute:

1 + (1 -n_z)^2/(1 -n_z^2) = [ (1 -n_z^2) + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2) ) ] / (1 -n_z^2 )

Simplify numerator: 1 -n_z^2 + 1 -2n_z +n_z^2 = 2 (1) - 2n_z → 2(1 -n_z).

Denominator: (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z).

So the norm squared is [2(1 -n_z)] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z).

Wait, let me recalculate:

Another approach: Let me compute denominator as 1 -n_z^2 = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z).

The numerator is 1*(1 -n_z^2) + (1 -n_z)^2.

= (1 -n_z^2) + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2)

= 1 -n_z^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2

= 2 - 2n_z.

So the norm squared is (2 -2n_z) / (1 -n_z^2).

Factor numerator: 2(1 -n_z).

Denominator: (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z).

So [2(1-n_z)] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z) → because (1-n_z) cancels.

So the norm is sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ] multiplied by sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), because 1/(sqrt(2/(1+n_z))) )= sqrt( (1+n_z)/2 ).

Wait, wait, because the norm squared is 2/(1 +n_z), so the norm is sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)), so to normalize, we multiply by 1/sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[1 * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), ( (1 -n_z)/n_x ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ]

Simplify:

First component: sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Second component: (1 -n_z) * sqrt( (1 +n_z) ) / (n_x * sqrt(2) ) )

Wait, but n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ), since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1.

So n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) )

So substituting:

Second component becomes [ (1-n_z) * sqrt(1 +n_z) ) ] / [ sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ) * sqrt(2) ) ]

Wait, let me write the denominator as sqrt( (1-n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ) which is sqrt(1 -n_z^2) = n_x.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Second component:

(1 -n_z) * sqrt(1 +n_z) ) / ( n_x * sqrt(2) ) )

n_x = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

So denominator: sqrt( (1-n_z)(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt(2).

So the second component is:

(1 -n_z) * sqrt(1 +n_z) ) / [ sqrt( (1-n_z)(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt(2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

sqrt( (1 +n_z) ) is sqrt(1 +n_z), and denominator has sqrt( (1 +n_z) ), so they cancel as follows:

(1 -n_z) * sqrt(1 +n_z) / [ sqrt(1 -n_z) * sqrt(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt(2) ) ].

Wait, maybe I can represent it as:

(1 -n_z) / sqrt( (1 -n_z) (1 +n_z) ) ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to square the components and see:

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider expressing the components in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: since n is in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle theta, where theta is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta).

Then, substituting into the eigenvector components:

First component: sqrt( (1 + sin(theta)) / 2 )

Second component: [ (1 - sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ) ] * sqrt( (1 + sin(theta)) / 2 )

Wait, let's compute this.

First component: sqrt( (1 + sin(theta))/2 )

Second component:

( (1 - sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ) * sqrt( (1 + sin(theta))/2 )

Simplify the second component:

= [ (1 - sin(theta)) / cos(theta) ) ] * sqrt( (1 + sin(theta))/2 )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ (1 - sin(theta)) * sqrt( (1 + sin(theta))/2 ) ] / cos(theta)

Hmm, perhaps we can rationalize this.

Let me compute (1 - sin(theta)) (1 + sin(theta)) = 1 - sin^2(theta) = cos^2(theta).

So, (1 - sin(theta)) = cos(theta) * sqrt( (1 - sin(theta)) / (1 + sin(theta)) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to square the second component and see.

Alternatively, I can write sqrt( (1 + sin(theta))/2 ) as cos(theta/2 - pi/4 ), but perhaps that's too much.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider expressing the eigenvector in terms of spin coherent states or using the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the eigenvector we're seeking is along a direction (n_x, 0, n_z) in the x-z plane, so the spin state is pointing in that direction. The general form of such a spinor is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the polar angle and phi is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane and we're considering positive x direction (since n is in x-z, phi=0).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector for spin in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z) is given by:

|ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

where theta is the polar angle (from the z-axis) and phi is the azimuthal angle (from the x-axis in the x-y plane). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0.

So the state becomes:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but in that case, how does this fit with our earlier expressions?

Wait, because our n is in the x-z plane, so perhaps the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi). But since phi is zero (because it's in the x-z plane), n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, that can't be right. Because when theta is 0, the direction is along +z, so n_x=0, n_z=1. When theta is pi/2, direction is along +x, n_x=1, n_z=0.

So with this parametrization, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, let me confirm:

If theta is the polar angle (from z), then in spherical coordinates,

x = r sin(theta) cos(phi),
y = r sin(theta) sin(phi),
z = r cos(theta).

So for r=1, phi=0, x = sin(theta), z= cos(theta).

So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, but earlier we thought of n_x as cos(theta) and n_z as sin(theta), but that's probably incorrect. Because when you point along x, theta is 90 degrees (pi/2) from z, so cos(theta) would be zero, which matches n_z=0, and n_x = sin(theta)=1.

So with this, n is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So in our case, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the eigenvector components were [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), (1 -n_z)/(n_x) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ]

But since n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta), then substituting:

First component: sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ), since 1 + cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2).

Second component: [ (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta) ) ] * sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 )

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 ), and 1 + cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2 ), so:

= [ (2 sin^2(theta/2)) / sin(theta) ) ] * sqrt( (2 cos^2(theta/2 )) / 2 )

Wait, sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 ) is sqrt(2 cos^2(theta/2)/2 ) = cos(theta/2).

So the second component becomes:

[ (2 sin^2(theta/2 )) / sin(theta) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

= [ (2 sin^2(theta/2 )) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2 sin^2(theta/2 )) ] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) ] * cos(theta/2 )

= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )

= sin(theta/2 )

So the second component is sin(theta/2), which matches the standard spinor expression.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, in our earlier parametrization, n_z is cos(theta), so the angle theta in the spinor is the same as the polar angle in the spherical coordinate system.

But in our problem, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, and the eigenvector for the operator P_n is [ cos(theta_S/2), sin(theta_S/2) ], where theta_S is the polar angle of the direction n.

Wait, but in our problem, n is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the spinor would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking back at our earlier calculation, the first component was sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), which with n_z=cos(theta) is sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) )/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ), which is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But the question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options given are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → but in x-z plane, phi=0, so e^{i 0}=1.

Option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos and sin terms.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something. Because the operator is P, not S (the spin operator). Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute, the problem statement says that the operator is P, but for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So perhaps P is proportional to the spin operator S.

Wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of spin are S_x, S_y, S_z. For a spin-1/2 particle, these are represented by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the operator P given in the problem is P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for P_y and P_z. So it's as if P is the spin operator. So the eigenstates are the same as the spin eigenstates.

So, the eigenvector we're calculating is for the spin operator along direction n. Hence, the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the question says "the normalized eigenvector", so the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me see:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → units don't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So this is probably incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → that's a spherical harmonic, but for a spin-1/2, the state is different.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ) → again, units issue, and seems like it's scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but why?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the operator P is not the spin operator but another operator. Because the problem states that the operator is P, but in the question, it's given as a vector operator. But in the case of spin, the spin operator S has components S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

So perhaps the operator P is another vector operator, such as the position operator or something else. But in the problem, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as (ħ/2) times Pauli matrices, which suggests that P is a spin operator. So the eigenvector would be the same as the spin state, which is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Therefore, the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix scaled by $\hbar/2$),
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix scaled by $\hbar/2$),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix scaled by $\hbar/2$).

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the expressions for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we have:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

From the first row, $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$, which gives:

\[
b = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} a.
\]

Substituting this into the second row confirms consistency. The eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, compute the normalization factor:

\[
\| \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \end{bmatrix} \|^2 = 1 + \left(\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{1 + \cos\theta}.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $\cos\theta = 1 - 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the general form of the spinor for a spin-1/2 particle aligned along a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is not dimensionally consistent for eigenvectors.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to spherical harmonics, not spinors.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary scaling factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
