Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

First, the problem says the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So it's a ^6Li nucleus.

The question is about the energy of the RHIC so that the speed v of the nucleus is 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at that speed. Oh wait, RHIC collides heavy ions, so the energy here refers to the total energy each ion has.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Right.

So the steps are: find the rest mass of the ^6Li nucleus, then compute gamma at v=0.96c, multiply by m cÂ² to get E.

Wait, but what's the rest mass of ^6Li? Well, the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its components. Each proton is about 1.007276
