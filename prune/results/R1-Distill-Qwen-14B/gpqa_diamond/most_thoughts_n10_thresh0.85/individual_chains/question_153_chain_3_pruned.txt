Okay, so I have this problem about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which is then resonance-stabilized.

Let me look at the first reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I think sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it might deprotonate something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. The structure of dimethyl malonate is like (CH3COO)2CH-. So the enolate would form at the alpha position, right? Because malonate has two carbonyl groups adjacent. So the enolate would be on the central carbon.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, with a p-tolyl group. Wait, no. I think the correct structure is more like CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the double bond. Wait, actually, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? No, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-position would be the CH2 end. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this.

So (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with
