Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, so two stars, same masses as the Sun, and each has a planet. Both planets are similar to Neptune in mass. They have circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the spectral line shifts detected.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the velocity of the star, which relates to the mass and orbit of the planet.

So, the shifts are given: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, the question says the shift of the same spectral line. Oh, so the same wavelength line, but in different stars. So the shift is due to the star's velocity moving toward or away from us.

Wait, no, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is the Doppler shift. The formula for the velocity is v = (λ observed - λ emitted)/λ emitted * c, but in units where c is 1, it's just the fractional change in wavelength.

Wait, more accurately, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v sin i) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the radial velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula relates K to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination.

Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the same inclination could be assumed? Or perhaps it's not given, but maybe we can assume both are edge-on (i=90 degrees, sin i=1). Since the question says both were found, perhaps they are edge-on, but I'm not sure if that's a necessary assumption here.

The key point is that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the star's mass, but wait, stars are much more massive than planets, so M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star
