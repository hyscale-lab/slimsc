Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Their orbits are circular. Also, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula I think is P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) )^2, or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think about the transit probability formula. Oh right, the transit probability is roughly given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a/(R_s + a))^2 ), but wait, no. Maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh, right, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for a transit is approximated by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, I think the actual formula is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (1 + (M_s / m_p)^(1/3)) ). No, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on. The probability is 1/(1 + (a/(R) ) ), but that doesnâ€™t sound right either. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, or something else. No, wait. The geometric probability P_geo is approximately (R / a), where R is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). But wait, that can't be right because if a is much larger than R, the probability would be very small. Oh wait, no, actually, the probability is (
