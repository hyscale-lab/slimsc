Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars ~ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So parallax in arcseconds is 1 over the distance in parsecs.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I probably need to express the number of stars as a function of distance. Let me think about that.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, that means 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5? Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, the number increases rapidly.

But wait, the question isn't just asking for N as a function of d. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r. Hmm, maybe it's asking about the rate of change, like the differential. So perhaps it's about how many more stars you get when you move a little bit further out.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell at radius r, which would depend on the volume or something. Oh wait, no, because in astronomy, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on both the volume (which depends on r^2 or r^3, depending on the dimensionality) and the density of stars.

Wait, that's another point. The given relation is about the number of stars varying with parallax. So I think it's implying that for a given parallax, the number of stars you observe is proportional to 1/plx^5. So as parallax decreases (since parallax is inversely proportional to distance), the number increases as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes large.

Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars per unit distance? Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of stars per unit volume, and how that volume changes with distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the density of stars along the line of sight. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d): plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx.

2. The number of stars (N) varies with plx as N ∝ 1/plx^5. So substituting d in terms of plx, N ∝ d^5.

Wait, wait. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per
