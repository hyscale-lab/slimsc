Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. I think that's when the conjugate addition happens.

The question has three parts, each asking about a Michael addition. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. It's a good nucleophile because the enolate form is resonance stabilized. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituents are in the E configuration. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the double bond. Wait, E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, since acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The substituent on carbon 3 is the p-tolyl group (since it's 3-). So the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but in E configuration. Wait, E means the higher priority groups are opposite each other. The substituents on the double bond would be CH2- and COOCH3 on one end, and p-tolyl on the other. So I think the E configuration would have the p-tolyl on one side and the COOCH3 on the other.

But wait, when the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the acrylate, which is the carbon adjacent to the carb
