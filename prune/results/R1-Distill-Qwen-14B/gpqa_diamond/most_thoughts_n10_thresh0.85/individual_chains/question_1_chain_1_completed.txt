Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

Wait, let me get back to the energy-time uncertainty relation. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Here, Δt is the time over which the energy is measured. If the lifetime of the state is the time Δt, then the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). 

So for each state, we can compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1: Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. Reduced Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ħ is approximately 1e-34 J·s. Let's compute ΔE1 first.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) = (1e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 5e-26 J.

But wait, we need that in eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 (eV) = 5e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (5 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ ~3e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2) = (1e-34) / (2e-8) ) = (1e-34) / (2e-8) = 5e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (5/1.602) * 1e-8 eV ≈ ~3e-9 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 3e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3e-9 eV.

But wait, wait. Wait, the calculation:

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.25e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ approx 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 /1.602e-19 = (5.25/1.602) * 1e-8 eV ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainty for state 1 is about 3.28e-7 eV, and for state 2, about 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be bigger than both of these uncertainties. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the maximum of the two, or the sum?

Wait, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements. If you have two states with energies E1 and E2, each with their own uncertainties, to resolve them, the difference ΔE = E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the intervals might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So, the minimum ΔE required is when ΔE ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is about 3.28e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.28e-8 eV. So adding them gives approximately 3.61e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than around 3.6e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C would be sufficient.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → about 1e-8 eV. That's bigger than 3.28e-8 (ΔE2) but smaller than ΔE1 (3e-7). So the energy difference would be bigger than ΔE2 but smaller than ΔE1. Hmm, but wait, that's not enough, because the difference is bigger than one uncertainty but not the other.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again. The energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the uncertainty in either state, it's hard to tell them apart.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's say E1 is known within ΔE1, and E2 is known within ΔE2. For E1 and E2 to be distinguishable, their intervals must not overlap. So the condition is that the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the difference is less than the sum, the two intervals might overlap, making it impossible to tell which state you're in.

So in this case, ΔE needs to be greater than 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. Which is way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, option C would work.

But wait, the other options: option D is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is way less than 3.6e-7 eV. So it's not enough.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to think about the natural linewidth. The energy uncertainty is given by the lifetime, and the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty for the two states to not overlap.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference ΔE must be such that the time for the states to evolve into distinguishable states is longer than the measurement time.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that you can't have both a precise energy (long lifetime) and a short lifetime (which gives a broad energy distribution).

So for a given energy difference ΔE, the time it takes for the state to evolve into a distinguishable state is related to ΔE. The condition for distinguishability would involve the energy difference being such that the interference between the states is resolved.

Hmm, perhaps another way: The time it takes to observe a phase difference of 2π between the two states is given by Δt ≈ ħ/(ΔE). So for the phase difference to be observable, this time must be less than the lifetime of the states.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think back to the original question. We need to find the energy difference such that the two states can be clearly resolved. The options are four different energy differences.

I think the key here is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that their energies don't overlap.

Wait, but in the energy spectrum, if two states have overlapping energy uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me find a formula that relates the energy difference for distinguishability.

I remember that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ħ/τ, where τ is the average lifetime. But perhaps in this case, since each state has its own τ, maybe the minimum ΔE is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The energy-time uncertainty principle says ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 = (1e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = (1e-34) / (1e-8) ) = 1e-26 J → 6e-8 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of these two: 6e-7 + 6e-8 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be around 1e-6 eV or higher to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6, so it's way above the needed value. So that works.

The other options are A) 1e-9 (too small), B) 1e-11 (too small), D) 1e-8 (which is 10 times smaller than 1e-7, but wait, 1e-8 is 0.01e-7. Our required minimum is about 6.6e-7, so D is 1e-8, which is 0.01e-7 → much smaller than required. So option C is the only one that's bigger than the required ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the energy difference doesn't need to be as large as the sum of uncertainties? Maybe it's just that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each state. So for example, if ΔE is greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, that might be sufficient.

In our case, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is greater than 6e-7 eV, then it's distinguishable. But option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger, so it's acceptable. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 6e-7, so it's not.

But wait, let me think about how energy levels are measured. The energy levels have a certain width (due to their lifetimes). If two levels are too close in energy, their lines would overlap, making them indistinguishable. So the separation should be larger than the sum of the half-widths (the uncertainties). So yes, the correct condition is that ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, the sum is about 6.6e-7 eV, as earlier.

So the energy difference must be more than 6.6e-7 eV. The only option that's bigger is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 6.6e-7 eV. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again. Let me compute ħ/(2τ) accurately.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. So:

ΔE1 (eV) = 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ (5.272859 / 1.602176634) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) ) = 5.272859e-27 J.

ΔE2 (eV) = 5.272859e-27 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 eV, so yes, option C would be sufficient.

The other options are way below that.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. Rearranging, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C**.
