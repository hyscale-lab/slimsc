Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these topics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I need to remember what regularization means. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which isn't physically meaningful. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the infinities manageable so you can subtract them (renormalization), leading to finite, physical results.

So, which theories require regularization? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Strings are tiny, and superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I remember that string theories aim to be a theory of quantum gravity, so they deal with high energies. But wait, string theories might not require the same kind of divergences as in QFT because they're background-dependent. Or do they? Wait, I'm not so sure. String theory does involve quantizing strings, and I think some regularization might be needed, but maybe in a different way than in QFT. Alternatively, maybe it's more about handling high energy in a different framework. I'm not certain about this one.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. I know that QCD has issues with things like confinement and the running coupling. But in terms of regularization, I remember that QCD calculations, especially in perturbation theory, require techniques like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. Because of the non-abelian nature and things like infrared divergences, regularization is necessary. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is the theory of electromagnetism, incorporating quantum mechanics. QED is an abelian gauge theory. When I think about regularization in QED, I remember that it's necessary because of the occurrence of divergences in loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy and vertex corrections lead to infinities that need to be handled via renormalization. So C definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. In classical electrodynamics, you don't have the same divergences as in the quantum theory. For example, things like the infinite charge density at a point charge (like the electron) don't really require regularization because you don't do loop integrals or deal with virtual particles. So in the classical theory, you don't need to regularize because there's no quantum divergence. So D might be the correct answer here.

Wait, but wait. The question is about high energies. Do any classical theories get into trouble with high energies? Well, classical electromagnetism breaks down at high energies because it doesn't account for quantum effects. But the question is about whether regularization is needed. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories wouldn't require it. So for classical ED, no regularization is needed because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the same divergences that regularization addresses.

So putting it all together: which theories require regularization? QED, QCD, and possibly superstring theory. Superstring theory is a quantum theory, so it may require some form of regularization, perhaps in loop calculations. But wait, I'm not sure if string theories avoid some divergences because of their structure. Alternatively, maybe in string theory, the divergences are tamed in a different way, like through the string tension or other parameters, so regularization isn't needed as in QFT.

Wait, in string theory, when you calculate amplitudes, do you encounter the same kinds of divergences as in QFT? I think in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of the string coupling and the number of strings, but the loop expansions (like genus expansion) might have different properties. For example, in
