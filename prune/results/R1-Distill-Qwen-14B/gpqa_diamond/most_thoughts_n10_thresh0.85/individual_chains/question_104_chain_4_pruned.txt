Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.

The problem states that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have planets detected. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are probably comparable. The key here is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relies on the Doppler effect. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's orbit, causing the spectral lines to shift. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. So, K is related to the shift in wavelength.

I remember the formula for the Doppler shift: the velocity K is proportional to the wavelength shift (delta lambda) over the rest wavelength (lambda_0). So, K = (delta lambda / lambda_0) * c, where c is the speed of light. But since the rest wavelength (lambda_0) is the same for both stars because they're similar (same spectral lines), the ratio of their velocities would be the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts.

Wait, but the problem gives the shifts in milliangstroms. So, Planet #1 has a shift of 5, and Planet #2 is 7. So, their velocity semi-amplitudes are in the ratio of 5:7? So, K1/K2 = 5/7.

But how does K relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method formula relates K to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the semi-major axis. Let me recall the formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) * (other constants? Wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the simplified version when M_p << M_star, which is
