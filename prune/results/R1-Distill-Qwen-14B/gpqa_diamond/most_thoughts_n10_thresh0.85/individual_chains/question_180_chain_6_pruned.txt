Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, let me break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay 2 meters from P. Interesting setup.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since it's an isolated system, I think we can assume that we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy.

But wait, the system's energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So, each pair contributes to the total energy. So, I need to calculate the potential energy for all possible pairs and sum them up.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, and all the charges except one are fixed at a certain distance from P, maybe the problem simplifies. Let me visualize this: the 13th charge is at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 is located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P.

Now, each of the 12 charges is at a distance 2m from P. So, the 13th charge is at P, so the distance between the 13th charge and any of the 12 is 2m. So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * q1 * q2) / r, where q1 is 2e, q2 is also 2e, and r is 2m.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but each pair among themselves—like between charge 1 and charge 2—what's their distance? Oh, that's a good point. Because all the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances depend on their positions. Hmm, but arranging them on the sphere in such a way that their mutual distances are maximized or minimized would affect the potential energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at a distance of 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. However, to find the minimum energy, we need the configuration that minimizes the total potential energy.

But wait, the potential energy for a system of charges depends on the distances between them. For point charges, the potential energy is always positive if they're like charges (same sign), because bringing them closer requires work. Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges would be positive because they repel each other. So, to have the minimum energy, the system would arrange the charges as far apart as possible. But wait, since the charges are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m, perhaps their mutual distances can't be increased beyond that, but they can be arranged in such a way that the sum of their potential energies is minimized.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy between any two charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r. Since all charges are the same (2e), and all are positive (since 2e is positive), then each pair contributes a positive potential energy. Wait, but wait. Wait, the question states each has charge 2e. So, e is the elementary charge, which is positive, so each charge is positive. So, each pair of charges would repel each other, leading to a positive potential energy.

But wait, I'm a bit confused now. The problem is to find the minimum energy. Wait, but if all the charges are positive, bringing them together would increase the potential energy. So the minimum energy would be when they're as far apart as possible. But in this setup, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P. So, their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m. But their mutual distances can vary; for instance
