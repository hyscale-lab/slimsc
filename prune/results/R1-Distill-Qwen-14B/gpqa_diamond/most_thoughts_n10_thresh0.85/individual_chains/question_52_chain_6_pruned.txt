Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question involves a star with certain characteristics and how some of its properties change when it has spots. The main thing here is the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels and how that ratio changes when the star has spots.

Wait, when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, but wait, I think the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, right? Because when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the star as seen from afar decreases.

So the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1, and n2 is in level 2. They say this ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, how does that happen?

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 is the higher energy level, E1 lower, and T is the temperature.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. Or wait, maybe it's n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? Let me think. Boltzmann factor is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)). So for n2, which is higher energy, it's lower population. So n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1.

Wait, so the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because n2 is less than n1, so n1/n2 is greater than 1 if E2 > E1 and g1/g2 is 1. That makes sense. Oh wait, but sometimes the statistical weights can be different, but the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe they're the same for both levels. So in that case, the ratio would be simply exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes smaller, because T is in the denominator.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots (Teff is lower), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't have spots. Let me see what that implies.

So, without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K. So the ratio when without spots is R1 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k * 6000) ), and with spots it's R2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(
