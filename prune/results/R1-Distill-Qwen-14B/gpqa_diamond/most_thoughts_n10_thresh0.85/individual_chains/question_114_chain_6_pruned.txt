Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll think it through step by step.

First, looking at the reactions given:

1. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. When ketones react with CN- under certain conditions, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, sometimes such reactions are reversible or require acid catalysis.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would typically give something like (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, wait the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH3? Or wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Which would be HOCH2C(CN)(CH2CH3)? No, wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps it's a two-step process. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by something else. Oh wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN: that's a ketone undergoing addition of cyanide. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ secondary alcohol with the cyanide attached. But wait, is there a work-up involved? Because sometimes after the addition, you might protonate or do something else.

Wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN in acidic conditions.
