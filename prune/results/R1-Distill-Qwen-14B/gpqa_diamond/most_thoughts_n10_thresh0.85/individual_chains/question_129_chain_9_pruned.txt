Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The first clue is that compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Oh wait, the hints are also important. Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I remember that phosphorous ylides are used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that compound A has a carbonyl group which was attacked by the ylide.

Wait, the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. The ylidene group is like a CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached via the double bond, right?

So the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. The starting material for a Wittig would be a carbonyl compound, probably a ketone or aldehyde. Since the product is a cyclopentane with a substituted double bond, compound A might have a cyclopentanone structure.

Let me think. The Wittig reagent (ylide) would attack the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an alkene. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-... cyclopentane, then the carbonyl in A must be at a position that becomes the double bond after the reaction.

Wait, let's sketch this. Suppose compound A is a cyclopentanone. Let's say it's 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when the Wittig reagent adds, the carbonyl (at position 3 or 4?) would form a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl... Wait, the numbering might be such that the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, and another substituent (the ylidene) is at position 4. So the carbonyl might have been at position 3 or 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a ketone group that, upon Wittig reaction, forms the double bond at position 4, and the substituents are at 1 and 2. So maybe the starting material is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone? Because the Wittig would add a group to the carbonyl, forming a double bond between, say, C3 and C4.

Wait, let me think again: the Wittig forms an alkene adjacent to where the carbonyl was. So if the product has a substituent at C4, like a propan-2-ylidene group, then the carbonyl in compound A must have been at C4. Or wait, maybe the carbonyl was at C3, and the Wittig adds a group across, making the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of the product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and on carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent like CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond. So the substituent is at position 4, which is a methylene group (CH2) attached to another CH(CH3).

Wait, wait, the propan-2-ylidene group would be a substituent that's a methylene group (CH2) attached to a CH(CH3), but in a ylidene form, which is CH2-CH(CH3)-, but as a substituent. So perhaps the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4, a CH2-CH(CH3) group connected via a double bond, making it a cyclopentene ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is like a substituent where the double bond is between C4 and another carbon. Wait, maybe it's more like cyclopentane with a substituent at C4 that is a propenyl group? Not sure, but perhaps the key point is that the Wittig reaction forms a new double bond and the structure of A is a cyclopentanone.

So, I'm thinking that compound A is a cyclopentanone with methyl groups. Let's say it's 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig would add across the carbonyl, converting it into a double bond. Let me imagine: cyclopentanone with methyl groups at C3 and C4. The Wittig would attack the carbonyl (C3?), leading to the formation of a double bond between, say, C3 and C4, with the substituents moving.

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should try to think of the product structure.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons (1 and 2), and on carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene substituent.

The propan-2-ylidene group is (CH2)CH(CH3)=. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-, but as a ylidene, so it's actually connected via a double bond. Wait, no, the ylidene is when the group is attached via a double bond. So the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached via a double bond to the cyclopentane ring.

So the structure would be:

Positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups.

At position 4, there's a CH2-CH(CH3) group attached via a double bond.

So the cyclopentane ring has a double bond between, say, C4 and C5 (since the substituent is at C4). So the ring is partially saturated, perhaps a cyclopentene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is forming a ring. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Wittig reaction. The ylide has a structure like (CH2)2P=CH-CH(CH3). When it reacts with a ketone, it forms an alkene. So the ketone (A) would be in a position where, after the Wittig, the double bond is formed.

So if A is a cyclopentanone where the carbonyl is at position 3, then the Wittig would add across the carbonyl, forming a double bond between C3 and C4. The ylide's R group is propan-2-ylidene, so the substituent would be added to the former carbonyl carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Since the product after Wittig has a substituent (propan-2-ylidene) at position 4, and methyl groups at 1 and 2, perhaps the original ketone in A is at position 4. Then, the Wittig would convert the ketone into a double bond, and the substituent would come from the ylide.

Wait, so if A is 4-methylcyclopentanone, the Wittig would add the ylide's substituent to the carbonyl, forming a double bond between C4 and C5 (assuming the ring is numbered such that the carbonyl is at C4). Wait, but the product has substituents at C1 and C2, so maybe the ring in A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the structure of A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when the Wittig reacts, it would form a double bond between C3 and C4, and the substituent would be from the ylide, which is propan-2-ylidene.

Wait, but then the product would have substituents at C3 and C4. Hmm, but the product has substituents at 1 and 2. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe the carbonyl is at position 1, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure of the Wittig reaction. The general product of a ketone with a Wittig reagent (ylide) is an alkene where the
