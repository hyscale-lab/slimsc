Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like:

v = (G * (M_p) / (M_s + M_p)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully. I recall that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are much less than the stars, so M_p << M_s. So we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the term (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( G * M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me write it correctly. The formula for K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But again, since M_p is much smaller and e=0, this simplifies. Let's see—another approach: for a star and planet system, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_s^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to relate the velocities of the stars for the two planets.

Wait, the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity of the star. Since the wavelength shift is given, and the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms, the velocities are proportional to these shifts. Let's call them K1 and K2 for Planet #1 and #2 respectively.

So K1 = 5, K2 =7 (in some unit, say milliangstroms per same spectral line). But the actual velocity is K = (lambda shift) / lambda_0 * c, where c is the speed of light. But since both are measured in the same spectral line, the ratio of K1 and K2 would be the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts. So K2 = (7/5) K1. Wait, no—if the shift is larger, the velocity is larger. So K2 is larger than K1.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of the orbital periods. Let's denote P1 and P2 as the periods of Planet #1 and #2. We need to find P2 / P1.

What affects the velocity semi-amplitude K? Let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The formula I've seen is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p and e are the same for both planets, and their orbits are edge-on (sin i ≈1, assuming i=90 for both), and M_s is the same for both stars, the K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all other terms are the same (same M_s, M_p, e, P is the variable here), K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, no, wait: Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the two K values for each planet.

Since both stars have the same mass (M_s), and both planets have the same mass (M_p), and both have circular orbits (e=0), the formula for K for each is:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Because all other terms are same. So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no: if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because, K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me see:

K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)

K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Hmm, but we know K2 = (7/5) K1, because the shift for Planet #2 is larger. Wait, no, wait. The shifts are K1=5 and K2=7. So K2 is larger than K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5.

Wait, K2 = (7/5) K1.

So from K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1)/(K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But K1/K2 = 5/7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Which is 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364 → approximately 0.36 times.

Wait, but wait: the question is how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1. So P2 is longer than P1 if the ratio P2/P1 is greater than 1. But according to this, P2 is about 0.36 times P1, which is shorter. So the period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it's about 36% of P1. So Planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then the ratio (P2/P1) is 0.36, which is less than 1. So the period of Planet #2 is shorter, not longer. So the question is perhaps looking for how much longer, but in this case, it's shorter.

Wait, let me double-check the setup. The RV method measures the star's velocity, K. A larger K means the star is moving faster due to the planet. A planet with a longer orbital period would have a smaller K because the star's velocity would be lower (since the orbital speed is slower, as period is longer). Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so if P2 is longer than P1, K2 would be smaller than K1. But in this case, K2 is larger (7 vs 5), so P2 must be smaller than P1.

So the calculation I did earlier is correct. (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than Planet #1? Wait, no. Because if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is: how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer, it's shorter. So the ratio is 0.36, meaning it's 36% of P1.

But the problem asks for how many times longer. So the correct answer is about 0.36 times as long, which would mean it's shorter.

But the options are: A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Well, P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me re-derive.

We have K ∝ 1/P^{1/3} → K1 = (C) / P1^{1/3}, K2 = C / P2^{1/3}.

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^{1/3}

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is roughly 0.36 times as long as planet 1. So planet 2's period is shorter, so when the question asks how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's, the answer is 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter by that factor.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e.,

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have similar masses, the proportionality constant is the same for both planets. Thus, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of the orbital periods as follows:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \) milliangstroms and \( K_2 = 7 \) milliangstroms. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
