Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework that includes all possible interactions that can be added to the Standard Model without introducing new particles. It's built by considering higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to pick the correct combination from the choices given.

First, let me think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. Any operator in a relativistic theory should respect this. So SMEFT being a part of effective field theory should definitely respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (i.e., momentum conservation). But wait, doesn't the SMEFT include operators that can break Poincare symmetry? Or do they have to respect it? I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they form a Poincare invariant theory. Because if you have terms that are not invariant under translations, the theory would be non-relativistic. So I think Poincare must be respected. So 2 is correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator (which is dimension six) conserves CP, but I think some operators can violate it. So CP symmetry isn't necessarily a must for all operators. So 3 isn't necessarily required.

CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Every operator that's part of a renormalizable theory must respect CPT. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory. Do the operators have to respect CPT? I think yes, because otherwise you would have a non-unitary theory, which is a problem. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, wait, but wait a moment. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But sometimes,
