Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it and try to figure out what's going on. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what products are formed.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The dibromo groups are on adjacent carbons, I think. When it's heated with excess KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen?

Wait, but wait. For dehydrohalogenation, you usually need a good leaving group and a base. So the first step, heating with KOH, would likely lead to the formation of an elimination product. Considering 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when each Br leaves, KOH abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of double bonds. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur. But wait, the product is called product 1, and it's a light yellow solid.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Hmm, that's different from an elimination product, which would have double bonds. Wait, maybe I was wrong about the reaction.

Oh wait, another possibility is that the bromides undergo a substitution reaction. But KOH is a base, not a typical nucleophile for substitution in such a rigid structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl group. That makes me think that the product is a ketone.

Wait a minute, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH could undergo intramolecular elimination. Each Br could leave, and the adjacent Hs could be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement? Or perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack leading to an epoxide? No, that's more with peracids.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two bromides are adjacent, and when KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an oxygen group. But since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's more of an elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a pinacol-like elimination? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. When a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But if two adjacent dihalides are present, perhaps the base could abstract two protons leading to two double bonds? Or maybe a conjugated diene. But then the product would have double bonds, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination leads to a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann condensation or some kind of cyclization. But no, that's for esters and such.

Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are on the same carbon, but in the compound, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So two separate Brs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the NMR. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where CH2 groups attached to oxygen appear. Like an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR says carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2
