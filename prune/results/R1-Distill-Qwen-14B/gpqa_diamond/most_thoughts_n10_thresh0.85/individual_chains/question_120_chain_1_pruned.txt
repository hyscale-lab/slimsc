Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. 

Wait, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because parallax is inversely related to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So if we have a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range? 

Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their spatial density is uniform. So in a given volume of space, there's the same number of stars. Let me think about how volume relates to distance. Oh right, volume depends on the cube of the radius. So for a sphere with radius r, volume is (4/3)πr³. 

Parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by the formula p = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). So d = 1/p. 

If I consider two thin spherical shells at distances d and d + dd, their volume would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area times thickness. So the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the volume of that shell. 

But wait, the question isn't about distance but about parallax. Since d = 1/p, substituting that in, the volume element in terms of parallax would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). Because d is 1/p, so d squared is 1/p², and dd is the change in d, which is delta d. But wait, when p changes by a small amount, dp, how does that relate to delta d? 

Since d = 1/p, delta d is approximately -1/p² dp. But maybe for small delta d, the negative sign just indicates direction, and since we're dealing with positive ranges, we can ignore the sign. So the volume element in parallax terms would be proportional to (1/p²) * (dp) multiplied by 4π. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct. The volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (delta d) * delta d? Or wait, no, the volume element in distance is 4π d² dd. So to express this in terms of p, since d=1/p, dd= - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume element is 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp). But since we're considering the magnitude, we can write it as 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because delta d is (delta p) / p². So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (delta d) where delta d is (delta p)/p². So substituting, volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (delta p / p²) ) = 4π (1/p^4) delta p. 

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me try again. The volume between p and p + delta p (in terms of parallax) would correspond to distance shells between d=1/p and d=1/(p+delta p). But for small delta p, 1/(p+delta p) is approximately 1/p - (delta p)/p². So the change in d is approximately delta d = (1/p - 1/(p+delta p)) ) = ( (p + delta p) - p ) / (p(p + delta p)) )) = delta p / (p² + p delta p). For small delta p, this approximates to delta d ≈ delta p / p².

So the volume between p and p+delta p is 4π (d^2) delta d, which is 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (delta p / p² ). So volume is 4π (1/p²) * (delta p / p² ) = 4π (delta p) / p^4.

But wait, the number of stars in a volume would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit parallax (delta p) would be proportional to 1/p^4. Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of plx (delta plx) changes with plx. So for a fixed delta plx, say 0.1 parsecs, the number of stars you'd expect is proportional to 1/p^4 times delta plx. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so it'd be 1/p^4. Because when you divide the number of stars by delta plx (since it's per unit plx), you get 1/p^4.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume is 4π (d)^2 delta d, and d is 1/p. So volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (delta d). But delta d is (delta p)/p^2, so volume becomes 4π (1/p^2) * (delta p / p^2 )= 4π (delta p) / p^4.

So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/p^4 * delta p. So if we're looking at the number per unit delta p (i.e., number per unit parallax), that's (number of stars) / (delta p) = (4π / p^4 ) * delta p / delta p = 4π / p^4. 

Wait, no. Because number of stars in the shell = K * (4 π (1/p)^2 ) * (delta d). But delta d = (delta p)/p². So number stars = K * 4 π (1/p²) * (delta p / p²) ) = K 4 π (delta p) / p^4.

So number per unit delta p is (number of stars) / (delta p) )= K *4 π / p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per delta p) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/p^4, option D is 1/p^3.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the derivation?

Wait another
