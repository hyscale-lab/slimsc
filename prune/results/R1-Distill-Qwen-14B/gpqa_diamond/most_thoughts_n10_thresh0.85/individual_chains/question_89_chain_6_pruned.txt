Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Alright, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane skeleton.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or perhaps some kind of ring-opening. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH... Oh, wait, it's an elimination reaction. Because when vicinal dihalides (halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they on adjacent carbons? Let me visualize adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, in a diamond lattice. The positions 1 and 3 might be on opposite sides. Hmm, wait, so maybe the structure is such that the bromines are on non-adjacent carbons. So if I eliminate two HBr molecules, would that form a double bond? But wait, where?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation via two separate eliminations. Wait, but KOH in such a case might lead to elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. But given the structure, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, 1 and 3 in adamantane—maybe they are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), then 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester.

Wait, so if the initial product has a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else. Oh! Maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? Or perhaps a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, and heating suggests E2 mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the Brs are on adjacent positions, leading to elimination to form a double bond. But the IR in the product shows a carbonyl, which isn't a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the possible product. Maybe the product is a diketone? Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could lead to a pinacol-like elimination. Wait, pinacol is 1,2-diol, but maybe in this case, with Br instead of OH, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone. So, if KOH is acting as a base, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br− and formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to a hydrogen. So if each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another carbon with a hydrogen, then elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have each Br on a carbon that's adjacent to another Br's carbon? No, because 1 and 3 are positions on the adamantane. Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and adjacent carbons have H's. So when KOH removes a hydrogen, the adjacent Br leaves as Br−, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, so each Br is on a bridgehead, and each elimination would form a carbonyl. So the product would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. But wait, let's think about the number of equivalent protons. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to
