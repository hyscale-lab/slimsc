Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and we need to figure out the structure based on that. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions, and we have to determine the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, I remember that the integration tells us the number of protons each peak represents. So 1H, 2H, 2H, 2H, 2H.

The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, so that's a good indication. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe it's a conjugated system.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. That could mean two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps from two benzene rings. Like para-substituted phenyl groups since the doublets might be from two protons each in a para arrangement. Wait, but para substitution would give a singlet usually, unless it's part of a coupling with another ring. Maybe it's a di-substituted benzene or something else.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but that's usually a singlet, but wait, we have 2H here. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated diene or an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton. Wait, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's not exchange but something else. Let me think.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. So, OCH2 maybe? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH2 that's split by coupling. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, considering the aldehyde at 9.72, and the CH2 at 3.66. Maybe it's a structure where there's a benzaldehyde group attached to a chain. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of rings and double bonds.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0 (assuming no halogens). So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1 )/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: maybe one ring (benzene, which is 3 DoU) and a couple of double bonds or rings. Benzene plus an aldehyde (which is a double bond) would account for 4, so one more. Alternatively, maybe a ring plus a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, I think it's more likely that the compound is a diaryl compound with an aldehyde and some substituents. Let's think about the NMR again.

The 9.72 ppm is an aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm is a CH2 that's probably attached to something else. Let's say maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2. But why is it a doublet? If the CH2 is next to another CH2, maybe like CH2CH2-, but that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's attached to a carbonyl group, so the CH2 is next to a carbonyl, making it split into a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent CH, but that's not clear. 

Wait, another possibility: the CH2 is part of an aliphatic chain. Let's say benzaldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which is then connected to something else. But then the other aromatic signals need to be considered.

Let me think about the aromatic regions. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have 2H. If each is a pair of equivalent protons, perhaps they are from two para-substituted benzene rings. So each ring has two protons, maybe as part of a coupling with another ring. Alternatively, maybe the rings are attached in such a way that each has substituents that cause the coupling.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound, with substituents on each benzene ring. For example, each ring has a substituent that's part of a conjugated system. Let me think about the 6.27 ppm peak. That's 2H, broad singlet. If it's a conjugated diene, maybe it's part of a buta-1,3-diene system. Alternatively, it could be an enol structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure where there's an aldehyde group and a conjugated diene. Like something like benzalacetophenone, but that doesn't fit the formula. Let me check the molecular formula again: C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen.

Wait, another approach: count the number of protons. The NMR shows 1 + 2 +2 +2 +2 =9 H, which matches the molecular formula.

So the structure has an aldehyde group, two sets of two aromatic protons each (so maybe two benzene rings, each with two H as substituent? Like maybe each ring has a substituent in the para position, leading to two doublets. Hmm. Wait, if each benzene ring has substituents that cause the protons to split into doublets, perhaps each ring has two substituents. For example, each ring has a substituent in the para position, and each substituent is a group that affects the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the aldehyde is connected via a chain to another benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) might be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, such as OCH2. But why would that be a doublet? Maybe because it's next to another CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group, which is part of an enol or something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with a side chain that has an oxygen. Like, perhaps, benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a CH2-O- group. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde connected to a CH2-O-CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH with heat.

The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is usually used for diazotization. So the compound must have an aromatic amine group. Wait, but the molecular formula has a N. So perhaps the compound is an aryl amine, maybe a benzylamine derivative? Or perhaps it's a nitro group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction steps: first diazotization, then H2O. Diazonium salt formation, then hydrolysis. If it's an aromatic amine, the diazonium salt could undergo various reactions, like coupling, but in water, maybe it's hydrolysis to form a phenol. Alternatively, if the amine is in a certain position, the hydrolysis could form a carbonyl group.

But wait, the initial compound has an N in the molecular formula. So, perhaps the initial structure has an amino group, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis forms a hydroxyl group.

But let's think: the initial compound has N, so maybe the structure is something like a benzylamine derivative. So perhaps after diazotization and subsequent reactions, the N is replaced by an OH group.

Wait, but the initial NMR doesn't show any obvious NH protons. So maybe the amine is not directly NH but part of a more complex structure, like an aniline. So maybe the initial compound has an aniline group.

Wait, another thought: the initial compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, with an aromatic ring and an aldehyde. But where's the nitrogen? Let me think about the molecular formula again: C8H9NO. So the N is likely part of an amine or amide group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-aminophenyl benzaldehyde? But that would have more carbons. Let me count: benzaldehyde
