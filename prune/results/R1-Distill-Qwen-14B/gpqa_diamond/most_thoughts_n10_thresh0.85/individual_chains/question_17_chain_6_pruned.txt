Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. So, the higher the K, the more stable the complex. In this case, the K is 5e10, which is pretty large, so the complex is very stable. That means that most of the EDTA is bound to calcium, right?

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. I think the complex is given as the stoichiometric form, so maybe the formula is CaY²- or something like that. The problem says it's the stochiometric complex, so presumably, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about the dissociation of this complex.

The reaction would be something like: 
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²− 

But wait, the formation constant K is usually written for the formation of the complex from the ions. So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2− 

And the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But in this solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, I think initially, all the EDTA is in the complex form. Then, the complex can dissociate a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait a second. The complex is a solution where CaEDTA²− is at 0.02 M. So, when it dissociates, it will produce Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in equal concentrations, but since K is so large, the dissociation should be minimal. So [Ca²+] would be very small.

Let me set up the equation. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of
