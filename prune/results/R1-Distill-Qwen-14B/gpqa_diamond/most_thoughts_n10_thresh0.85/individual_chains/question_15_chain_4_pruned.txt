Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, transiting is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, right? And transits are important because they help us determine the planet's size, since the drop in brightness tells us how much area the planet blocks.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. Wait, so Planet_1's period is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital periods usually mean closer orbits.

The stars are a bit different. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Interesting. So same radius, different masses.

The question is about the probability of transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, the probability is also a function of how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. But since both are already detected via RV, which gives us their minimum masses, I think the main factors here are the size of the planet relative to the star and the star's size.

Wait, no. Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) ), but maybe I'm mixing some things up. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability of transit is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in the plane perpendicular to our line of sight) compared to the star's radius, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius, but that's not exactly right. Oh wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability of the planet transiting is more about the orbital geometry.

Wait, another way: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a /
