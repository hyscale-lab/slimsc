Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by the formula d(hkl) = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) / (a²) ) ), wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos γ + kl cos β) ) )

Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Another thought: Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is simplified because all angles are 90 degrees, so cos terms are zero. But here, it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a special case where all edges are equal, but angles can be different. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the three edges are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

So the general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos γ + kl cos β) )

Wait, maybe I should write this correctly. Let me think again. The formula for d_{hkl} when the lattice is not cubic is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. I think the general formula for a non-cubic system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( ( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) ) - ( 2hk cos γ )/(a b) - ( 2hl cos β )/(a c) - ( 2kl cos α )/(b c) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So substituting that into the formula, it should simplify.

Let me substitute. Since a = b = c, let’s denote them all as a. And all angles α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2[ hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α ] / (a² )

Because all the cos terms are the same since α=β=γ=30.

So simplifying further:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ] / a²

Factor out the cos α from the terms:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, let me make sure that's correct. Because when a = b = c and angles are equal, the formula should be symmetrical. So yes, that seems right.

Now, in this problem, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plug in h=1, k=1, l=1.

So numerator inside the sqrt is 1² + 1² +1² - 2 cos(30) (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 )

Let me compute each part.

1²+1²+1² = 3.

Then, the 2 cos(30) ( sum of hk + hl + kl )

Wait, hk = 1*1 =1, same for hl and kl. So sum is 1+1+1=3.

So the second term is 2 * cos30 * 3.

So,

3 - 2 * cos30 *3.

Wait, so:

Inside sqrt: 3 - (6 * cos30)

Compute cos30: √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So,

3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the denominator inside the sqrt would be negative, which would make d imaginary. But that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the signs. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, in the formula, the denominator is h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ). Oh wait, but that's for a general system. But perhaps I missed a sign.

Wait, no, I think I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The correct formula for interplanar distance is:

d^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (b c sin α)^2 (h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos β - 2 k l cos γ ) ]

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal formula. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the Miller indices and the lattice parameters in the rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system. Since a = b = c, and angles are all the same, the formula for d_{hkl} can be simplified.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α) ), but that might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I should find the interplanar distance using the reciprocal lattice method. The reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system are given by:

Reciprocal basis vectors are:

b1 = (2π/a) (1,0,0)
b2 = (2π/a) (cos α, sin α, 0)
b3 = (2π/a) (cos α, (cos β - cos α)/sin α, 1/(sin α) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g for a rhombohedral lattice is:

g = [ [ a² , a² cos α, a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a² cos α, a² ] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor g^(-1) can be used to compute d_{hkl}.

The interplanar distance is given by:

d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos α - 2 k l cos α ) / a²

Wait, that's the formula I used earlier, but substituting h=1, k=1, l=1 gives a negative denominator, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me check another source. Oh wait, maybe I should look up the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos α - 2 k l cos α )

But wait, this would give a negative denominator for h=k=l=1, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos α + 2 k l cos α )

But that would make the denominator bigger, possibly positive. Wait, but what's the correct formula?

Wait another approach: The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = 1/√( (h² (b² c² sin² α) + k² (a² c² sin² β) + l² (a² b² sin² γ) ) 
                - 2 h k a b c² sin α sin β cos γ 
                - 2 h l a b c sin α sin γ cos β 
                - 2 k l a b c sin β sin γ cos α ) )

But this is getting too complicated, especially for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and α = β = γ. Let's try substituting those conditions.

So a = b = c = a.

Angles α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So, substituting into the general formula:

d² = 1 / [ ( (h² (a² a² sin² 30
