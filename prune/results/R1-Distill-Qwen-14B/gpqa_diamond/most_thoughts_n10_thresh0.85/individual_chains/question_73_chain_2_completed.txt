Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of relativity comes into play. Also, for the total energy, I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them together.

Let me break it down into parts. First, the relative speed.

The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But here, both are moving in the same direction. So, the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities, but adjusted for relativity. Wait, no. Because from the perspective of one astronaut, the other is moving at (u - v) divided by (1 - (uv)/c²), right?

Wait, the problem is about their relative speed. Let me think. If they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of the faster astronaut from the frame of the slower one. Or wait, actually, no. If astronaut 1 is moving at u and astronaut 2 at v, both in the same direction, then from astronaut 2's perspective, astronaut 1 is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify. Let me imagine the frame where astronaut 1 is at rest. Then, astronaut 2 is moving at v = 0.5c. But in the lab frame, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So, the relative speed of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So numerator is (-0.1c). Denominator is (1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1 / 0.7) c ≈ -0.1428c. The negative indicates direction—so astronaut 2 is moving at about -0.1428c relative to astronaut 1. But speed is a positive quantity, so the relative speed is 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which is about 0.14 times the speed of light.

Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that narrows it down. Now, for the energy part.

Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 /c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = 3m * 1.1547 c². Let me compute this: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464. So E2 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E = 5.96 m c² and v_rel is 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma1: 0.6c → (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1.25. E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5^2 = 0.25. 1-0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. E2 = 3m * 1.1547 c². 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.4641 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking at options, option C is E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower.

Wait, but did I consider the rest mass correctly? The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So when calculating their energies, it's gamma times their own masses times c squared.

So yes, I think the calculations are correct. So option C has the correct E and the correct v_rel.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc²). So that must be the correct choice.

Let me recap. The relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the two astronauts are moving at \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is a positive quantity. Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \( 2m \), Speed = \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = 2m \cdot 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \( 3m \), Speed = \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = 3m \cdot 1.1547c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
