Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question says: there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Wait, the minimum energy. Oh right, in systems of charges, the potential energy is related to their configuration. Since the charges are identical and likely repelling each other, the minimum energy would probably be when they're arranged in the most stable configuration possible. But wait, 12 are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, maybe as a central charge, and the others are arranged around it.

Wait, each charge is 2e, so each is positive because e is the elementary charge, but wait, no, e could be positive or negative. Oh wait, in the context, the charge is 2e, but since the system is isolated, the sign might matter. But since all are identical, if they are all positive, they would repel. But if they are negative, they also repel because like charges repel. So regardless, the 12 charges around will be repelling each other and the central charge.

Wait, the 12 are constrained at 2 m from P. So they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e as well.

So the problem is about calculating the electric potential energy of this system. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, and the charges are all the same, I think the calculation would involve interactions between each pair.

But wait, since all the 12 charges are identical and located at the same distance from P, maybe there's a symmetry I can exploit here.

Let me think about how to calculate the potential energy. The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately
