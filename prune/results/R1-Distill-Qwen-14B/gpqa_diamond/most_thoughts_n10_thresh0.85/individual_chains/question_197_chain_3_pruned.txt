Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad area, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other options don't seem to involve amines, maybe it's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have that around 1700, but if it's higher, maybe it's an ester or a ketone? But wait, another peak at 1610 cm-1—could that be conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent? The 1450 cm-1 is probably some sort of aromatic ring vibration, maybe C=C stretching.

Now, looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is often a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe there's a COOH group. But wait, if the compound has a COOH, then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present. The 1720 cm-1 could be the C=O of the COOH. Alternatively, it could be an ester, but the H would not be as downfield as 10.5 for an ester; that's more like a carboxylic acid.

The other signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): That's a typical pattern for an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, or perhaps a CH next to something else, like an ester or a ketone.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another set of protons, maybe part of a longer chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of some sort? No, it's a doublet, so maybe a CH2 group attached to something, like a branching. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. Like a -CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together. The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say positions 1 and 4 on the benzene are substituted. What substituents?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2? Wait, no, wait, the structure would be phenyl-CH2-COOH? Or phenyl-CH2-CH2-COOH? Maybe not. Or perhaps the substituents are on the benzene. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5, which would be the -COOH proton. So if the structure has a benzene ring with a COOH group, that fits. Then, the substituents.

Looking at the NMR again, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets. So two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the benzene has two substituents, each para to each other, and each with two equivalent protons. Wait, no, because each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded. So for example, if the substituents are at positions 4 and 1, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, the substituents are in the ortho positions. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are one at para position and another at a meta position? No, because that would complicate the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each with their own ortho and para positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions (1 and 4), but one substituent is an ethyl group and the other is a propanoic acid group. But that would mean the benzene has two substituents: one at position 2 and one at position 5, but that's getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and something else. Let me try to draw this out.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a carbonyl, which is probably a carboxylic acid. So the structure must have a COOH group. So looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid at position 2? Or the other way around.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the ortho positions. No, wait, no. If a benzene ring has two substituents para to each other, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be split into doublets. So, for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), but that's not para. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-dimethyl group? No, but that would give more complex splitting.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the substituents: the H at 10.5 ppm is probably the COOH proton. So the benzene ring is attached to a COOH group. Then, what else is attached? The other substituent on the benzene would cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has a COOH group at position 4 and another substituent at position, say, 1. Let me think about the NMR.

The 8.0 ppm (d,
