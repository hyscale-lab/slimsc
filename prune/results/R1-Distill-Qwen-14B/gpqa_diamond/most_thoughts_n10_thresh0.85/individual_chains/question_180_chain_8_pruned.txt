Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? The elementary charge is about 1.6e-19 coulombs, so each of these particles has a charge of 3.2e-19 C. 

Now, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, I think point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in an electric system. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but wait, energy-wise, it's the potential energy stored in the system when the charges are brought together. 

Wait, since all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, I think the problem is about calculating the potential energy of the system when the 13th charge is placed at P. Or maybe it's the potential energy between all the charges? No, wait, because the 13th is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2m from it.

Wait, but energy in electrostatics usually refers to the potential energy stored in the configuration of the charges. So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the 13th charge is at P, and the others are at 2m away, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the 13th.

Wait, but are the 12 charges just all at point P? No, wait, no. The setup says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So the 12 charges are each located on a sphere (or maybe a circle) of radius 2 meters around P, and the 13th is fixed at P. 

But wait, how exactly are the 12 arranged? Are they all equally spaced on a sphere? Or maybe arranged in some symmetric way? Because the potential energy calculation depends on their arrangement. Oh, but wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so maybe the charges are all identical and fixed in place except for the
