Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

The options are A through D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So the Ca-EDTA complex forms when Ca^2+ ions bind with EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, the formula for the formation constant K is something like K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right, because the complex is CaEDTA^2-.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], right?

And we're to find [Ca^2+]. So, if I rearrange the K expression, [Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (K * [EDTA^4-]).

Hmm, but wait. In this scenario, we're assuming that the solution is stoichiometric. So, I think that means the initial amounts of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio. But when they form the complex, the concentrations are tied together. But wait, perhaps that's not applicable here because the problem states the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so maybe the initial concentrations are such that all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as the complex being formed, and under the given conditions, the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is very large. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be very low.

Wait, let's model it. Let’s denote:

Let’s say the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M.

Then, the formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA^
