Okay, I need to figure out the chemical formula of the unknown compound based on the given spectroscopy data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, while alcohols are broad but maybe not as strong. But the presence of both a broad peak and other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 suggests something else. 

The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 are strong. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl group, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or an amide, but considering the other data, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Wait, but wait: the 1650 cm^-1 is more in the range of an aromatic C=C or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an ester or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests the presence of a double bond in the molecule, perhaps an alkene or an aromatic ring.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible ions. For example, CH3O would be 31, but 45? Maybe (CH2)2O would be 45? Wait, (CH3)2CO is 58. Alternatively, a fragment like CH3CH2O+ would be 45 (since CH2CH2O+ is 45: 12*2 + 1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me compute: 45 is the mass. Let's see: 45 could be C3H7O or something else. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about the possible formula. 45 can be (CH3)2O (which is 30, no), or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. C3H7O is 3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36 +7 +16=59, which is higher. Oh wait, wait, the fragment at m/z 45 is 45. So what could that be? Let me think: 45 = 12*3 + 1* (something) + 16* (something else). Wait, 45 can be (CH3)2CH-O+, but that's 45? Let me compute: (CH3)2CH-O+ would be (3*12) + (7*1) + 16. Hmm, 36 +7 is 43, plus 16 is 59. No. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-O+? Molecular weight of that would be 29 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 16 (O) = 46? No, wait: CH2=CH-O+ would be 29 +16 =45? Because CH2=CH-O+ would have a mass of 12*2 + 1*3 +16 =24+3+16=43. Hmm, not quite. Wait, perhaps it's a methyl ester or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about possible functional groups.

Looking back, FTIR shows O-H (maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid), and two carbonyl groups. Wait, or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, the 1700 could be a carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C). Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So maybe the molecule has a double bond, either an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Let me think about possible structures. If the molecule has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring, perhaps it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative. But let's see the options.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6
