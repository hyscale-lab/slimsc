Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a reaction scheme where a compound A undergoes several reactions to form compounds B, C, D, and finally E. The task is to identify compound E from the given options. Additionally, there are some hints provided, so I should make sure to use those.

Let's break down the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The options are all cyclic ketones, so E is a cyclic ketone.

Now, let's look at the hints:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that compound A is a ketone. Because the Wittig reaction requires an aldehyde or ketone as a partner.

Wait, the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is a substituent, like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane ring.

So the product is a cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1,2 (two methyl groups) and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl and position 4 as a propenyl group? Or wait, maybe the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or no, wait, the ylidene would be more like a group with a double bond. Let me think.

In a Wittig reaction, the ylide (like Ph3P=CH-R) reacts with a carbonyl (like A) to form an alkene. So if the product has a substituent like propan-2-ylidene, that could be the result of the ylide's R group.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and the 4 position has a propan-2-ylidene group. So the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent attached via a double bond. Wait, but in the product, it's a cyclopentane so substituents are on the ring. So what's the structure of A?

Wait, if A is a cyclopentanone (since the Wittig reaction requires a carbonyl), then the ylide would attack the carbonyl, forming an alkene. So the position of the substituents would depend on where the carbonyl is.

Alternatively, in the ylide, perhaps the R group is propan-2-yl. So when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl group (probably a ketone) would be replaced by the CH2-C(CH3)2 group? Or wait, maybe the ylide is something like CH2-C(CH3)2-PPh3+, so when it reacts with A, which is a ketone, it forms a new double bond.

But the product has a substituent at position 4. So perhaps the cyclopentane ring's carbonyl is at position 4, and after the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl is replaced by a CH2-CH(CH3)2 group? Or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentanone (A) has the carbonyl at position 4. Then, the Wittig reaction would add a substituent across the carbonyl, forming a double bond between positions 4 and perhaps adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure of A is cyclopentanone. If A is cyclopentanone (a five-membered ring with a ketone group), then the Wittig reaction would open the ketone to form an alkene. So the product would have a double bond where the ketone was.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are at positions 1,2, and 4. So perhaps the initial compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone? No, let me think again.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4.

Propan-2-ylidene is like CH2-C(CH3)=. So when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl group in A is replaced by a CH2-C(CH3)2 group, but that doesn't form a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the Wittig reaction, the ylide has a double bond between P and C, and when it reacts with a carbonyl, the oxygen is replaced by the R group from the ylide. Wait, no, more accurately, the carbonyl (like R-C=O) reacts with the ylide (like Ph3P=CH2) to form R-CH2-CH2-Ph3P=O, but wait, no, the actual product is R
