Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and we need to figure out what the structure is, then determine the product after a series of reactions.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that aromatic protons usually appear between 6.5-8.5 ppm. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton, right? Because aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm and they typically show a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons, but wait, aldehydes are usually at the end of the chain, so maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol group or another functional group. Hmm.

Looking at the other peaks, the doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of an aromatic ring. The 6.98 is a doublet, which might suggest two protons next to each other on a ring. Similarly, 6.51 is a doublet. This could indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, because in para substitution, the protons are opposite each other and would couple with each other, giving a doublet for each. But wait, if it's para, wouldn't each pair of protons be a singlet? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. In a para substitution with two substituents, you get two doublets for the protons. Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, but that might not fit here.

Wait, let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene with, say, two substituents, each substituent is opposite. The protons next to substituents would be equivalent, but in this case, the two doublets (6.98 and 6.51) might suggest two different aromatic environments. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with another substituent.

Wait, another thought: the two doublets could be from two different aromatic rings. Like, perhaps the compound has two benzene rings attached. So maybe each ring has two protons that are doublets.

Looking at the NMR, the 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could be an -OH proton, but wait, 2H as a broad singlet. Or maybe alkenyl protons. Wait, no, because if it's a singlet, they're not splitting each other. Maybe it's a conjugated system where the protons are deshielded and not splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton or something else. Hmm.

The 3.66 ppm is a d (doublet) of 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, or perhaps a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is either a ring or a double bond. Formula is C8H9NO.

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. X is 0 here.

So, Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1]/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (
