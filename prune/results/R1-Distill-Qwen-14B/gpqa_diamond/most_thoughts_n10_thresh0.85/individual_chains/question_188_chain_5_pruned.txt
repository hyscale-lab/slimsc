Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal structure. I remember that a rhombohedron is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are equal too. Oh right, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So that's a rhombic crystal system with a= b= c, and angles all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Interatomic distance—oh, wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, which would be the lattice parameter a for a cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral system, where a=b=c, but the angles are different, the lattice parameter is a. So here, a is 10 angstroms since it's the interatomic distance.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance, d_hkl, is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor in X-ray diffraction. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1 - (cos α + cos β + cos γ)/(1 + cos α cos β cos γ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think the formula for inter
