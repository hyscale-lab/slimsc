Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? Because in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are the same length, right? So yes, a = 10 Angstroms.

The angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. Hmm, rhombohedral systems have all sides equal but angles can vary. Since all three angles are 30 degrees, this must be a special case, maybe a primitive rhombohedral system.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance d is given by the formula from the Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2kl cos(gamma) ) )

Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived from the unit cell parameters. For a general rhombohedral system with lattice parameter a and angles alpha (which are all equal here, so alpha = beta = gamma), the formula simplifies because all the angles are the same.

The general formula for d_{hkl} is:
d = [ (a^2 ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos alpha + kl cos alpha) )) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, I might have that wrong. Let me recall. Oh, right, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Because in rhombohedral, all the angles are the same, so each term is cos α.

So for the (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1. So substitution:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) )

Wait, wait, let me calculate the denominator step by step.

First, h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the sum of the other terms: 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos alpha + 2kl cos alpha.

Each term is 2*1*1*cos(30). Since all angles are 30 degrees, each of the three terms is 2 * cos(30). So three terms would sum to 3 * (2 cos(30)) )= 6 cos(30).

Wait, wait, no. Let's see: Each 2hk cos alpha is 2*1*1 * cos(30). So each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl) would be 2 cos(30). So adding all three, it's 2 cos(30) + 2 cos(30) + 2 cos(30) = 6 cos(30).

So putting it all together:

Denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 6 cos(30°).

Wait, but I have to compute that.

First, cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 is about 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number is not real. That would mean the interplanar distance is imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Oh wait, I think I messed up the sign. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, that's the formula I used. So for our case, 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute that.

3 minus 6*(sqrt(3)/2) equals 3 - 3*sqrt(3). Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2) is 3 sqrt(3).

So 3 ≈ 3, 3 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196. So 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196. That's negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, did I get the formula wrong? Maybe I swapped a sign. Let me think: the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... ). The denominator must be positive, so maybe I got the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral systems is slightly different, considering the angles. Wait, another source says that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos α + 2 k l cos α )) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, so maybe I had the sign wrong. Because in some cases, the formula for d^2 is (h² +k² + l² - ... ), but perhaps in rhombohedral it's different. Let me think: in an orthorhombic system, all angles are 90°, so cos 90 is zero,
