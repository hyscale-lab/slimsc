Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex forms. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

I think the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n where n is from 0 to 4, since there are four β values. The species are Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. But wait, the question specifically mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ I suppose. So they're asking for the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+?

Wait no, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I think in some cases, the color changes with different complexes. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a different color than [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. The blue one is probably [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or maybe another. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the options are about the percentage, so maybe I don't need to know the exact complex but just calculate the distribution based on the β values.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe dithiocyanato refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex. Or perhaps it's a typo and they mean tetra? Because sometimes the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Hmm. Well, regardless, maybe I
