Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's start by carefully reading the question and the steps involved.

So, the first part tells me that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given for this product.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Adamantane has a structure similar to diamond, right? It's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused in a chair-like formation. The 1,3-dibromo implies that there are bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

Heating with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an elimination reaction. Considering it's dibromide, with two bromine atoms, the KOH might deprotonate something, leading to an E2 elimination. Wait, but with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination? Or maybe a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement?

The product is a light yellow solid. Also, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl stretch, so likely a ketone or maybe an ester. But considering the reaction conditions with KOH, perhaps it's a ketone. So, if the starting material is a dibromide, and KOH is eliminating to form a ketone, that makes sense. Because elimination would form a double bond, but wait, no, wait. Wait, if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are not adjacent. Hmm, so maybe it's a di-elimination. Or perhaps it's an oxidation?

Wait, no. KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait, but wait. If you have a dibromide, and you eliminate two molecules of HBr, perhaps you form a diene? But then, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more of a carbonyl. So maybe it's an oxidation product, but KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines, maybe leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility is that the dibromide undergoes a cleavage. KOH could induce a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to formation of ketones. Oh, right! In some cases, dihalides when treated with strong bases can undergo cleavage. For example, vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) treated with a base can eliminate to form alkenes or, under certain conditions, ketones if the structure allows.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the positions are not adjacent. So maybe the KOH isn't causing elimination but something else. Wait, alternatively, maybe the structure of adamantane allows for some kind of ring opening. Oh! When you have a dihalide on adamantane, heating with a base like KOH could cause a ring-opening, especially if the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. The formula for such a reaction... For example, consider when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, perhaps in an elimination reaction, but since the dihalide is not vicinal, the elimination would form a double bond elsewhere, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a beta-elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Oppenauer oxidation, but that's for alcohols to ketones, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dibromide is undergoing a pinacol-like rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a dibromide, not a diol. Oh, but wait, I've heard of the hydroxide-induced cleavage of geminal dihalides. If the dibromide is geminal (same carbon), the base would cause cleavage to form a carbonyl. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a geminal dihalide; each Br is on a different carbon.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the product. The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So the product is likely a ketone. Considering the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom or part of an ether, but since there's a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet or a doublet? The question says 4.79(2H). The number in the parenthesis is the integration. So 2H. Singlet would mean no neighboring Hs. But the way it's written, it's just 4.79(2H), so maybe it's a triplet or something else. Wait, but the way they wrote the NMR is: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94(2H). So, for the 2H at 4.79, the splitting isn't specified, but given that it's a singlet, perhaps? Or maybe a triplet, depending on what's adjacent.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl (from IR) in a product from a dihalide and KOH suggests that we have formed a ketone. So perhaps the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl.

Wait, considering the structure of adamantane. Let me imagine it: each bridgehead carbon (like positions 1 and 3) has two neighboring bridgehead carbons. So, when the two Br atoms are on 1 and 3, perhaps the base induces a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: when a geminal dihalide (two Brs on the same C) is treated with a base, it can form a ketone. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on different carbons. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the Cope elimination? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case where the base abstracts a proton which is antiperiplanar to the Br, leading to an E2 elimination.

Wait, if two Brs are on adjacent carbons (but in this case, they're not, 1 and 3 are separated), so elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but that's not possible. So perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a process where the base induces the formation of a ketone via some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction products again. The product has a carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹), so that's a ketone. The NMR shows a 2H at around 4.79 ppm. That region is typical for CH2 groups attached to an oxygen, like ethers or esters, but in this case, a ketone. Wait, but ketones don't have Hs attached. So maybe the 2H is adjacent to the carbonyl. Maybe it's a CH2CO group.

Wait, the NMR (for product 1):

- 4.79 ppm, 2H: possibly a CH2 attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester, or adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H: likely the adamantane ring's Hs. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent Hs, but perhaps after reaction, some become nonequivalent.

- 1.94 ppm, 2H: perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because the carbonyl would be from an epoxide, but IR at 1720 is more likely a ketone or ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone.

Wait, another approach: think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each bridgehead (positions 1 and 3) has two Br atoms attached. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, forming two carbonyl groups? That would form a diketone. But would that fit the NMR?

Wait, let me imagine the product. Adamantane has four rings; if positions 1 and 3 are each losing Br and forming carbonyls, perhaps the structure becomes something like 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But how would that affect the NMR? The CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. So the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2CO group, perhaps as a triplet if it's next to another CH2.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose that the elimination of two HBr molecules occurs, leading to the formation of two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. The structure would then have two adjacent ketone groups.

But how does that happen? Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing each C-Br to eliminate and form a double bond, but that would require each C-Br to have a β H. Alternatively, perhaps each Br leaves, and the base deprotonates to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the product would have hydroxyl groups. But the IR shows a carbonyl, not a hydroxyl (which would be around 3300 cm⁻¹ for O-H stretch, but maybe it's absent here).

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this first step.

Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, probably a medium or strong intensity peak for a ketone or ester. Since KOH is a base, maybe it's a ketone formed via elimination. So perhaps each C-Br is deprotonated, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the KOH could be causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. For example, if each Br is removed, and the adjacent C-H is deprotonated, leading to a carbonyl group. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, the two carbons (1 and 3) that were attached to Br would each form a carbonyl group. But that would require that each of those carbons has two Hs to eliminate, which might not be the case in adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, but the problem states it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which I think means they're on non-adjacent bridgehead carbons. So perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when the base abstracts a β-H from each bridge, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl group on each bridgehead. So the product would be a 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But how would this look? The structure would have two ketone groups, and the bridgehead carbons would each be carbonyls. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would experience different environments, leading to splitting in the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows 2H at 4.79. If those are adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps they're in a CH2 group attached to the carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O=C

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead has a carbonyl, and the adjacent carbons have CH2 groups.

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to two CH groups. If each bridgehead (C1 and C3) loses Br and forms a carbonyl, perhaps the adjacent CH groups become CH2 groups, since each bridgehead would have two adjacent CH groups. So, for example, each bridgehead (originally CH2Br) becomes a carbonyl, and the adjacent carbons (originally CH) become CH2.

So the product would be 1,3-diketone adamantane, with each bridgehead as a carbonyl and adjacent CH2 groups. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls as being more deshielded, so appearing around 4.79 ppm.

In that case, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each be split based on their neighboring Hs. So, each CH2 group next to a carbonyl (let's say, two of them) would be in a symmetrical environment, perhaps leading to a singlet. Wait, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, so maybe it's a single CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so adding ketones would modify the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mono-ketone, but how? Because the starting material is a dihalide. Wait, maybe only one of the Brs is eliminated, but that would require that the other Br remains, which doesn't fit with the IR peak.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating the first step. Let me think about the second step, which might help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, because in the first step, KOH was used, which is not a chlorinating agent. Alternatively, product 1 might have a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and under Friedel-Crafts conditions, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 has a ketone, and heating with Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's undergoing some kind of cyclization or forming an enol ether or something.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol? No, because the IR shows a carbonyl, not OH.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with a Lewis acid could cause it to undergo acetylation or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an acyl chloride. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl bromide? No, because KOH would have hydrolyzed any acyl bromide to a ketone.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about what product 2 is. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond that is cleaved by ozone. So product 2 probably has a diene or a triene structure.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or another structure with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a diketone (1,3-diketone), then under Friedel-Crafts conditions, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization to form a cyclic ketone or maybe a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enone (conjugated enol), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and with the Lewis acid, it undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation. But in that case, product 2 would have a double bond.

Wait, another angle: product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have a functional group that can form a double bond upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and under acid conditions, it loses water to form a double bond. But earlier, we thought product 1 is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 has a double bond, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, formed via elimination. How? Maybe the ketone undergoes dehydration to form an enone.

But for that, the ketone would need to have adjacent Hs. So, perhaps product 1 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to the carbonyl, and under acid conditions, it loses a water molecule to form a double bond.

Wait, let me think. If product 1 has a structure like (CH2)2CO, then under acid, it could lose H2O to form CH2=CH-CO. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 has a cyclopropane ring or something that can open under acid to form a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, but earlier reasoning suggests IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

After ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where product 2 had double bonds. So, if product 2 is a conjugated diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if product 2 is a triene, product 3 would have three carbonyls, but that's less likely.

Wait, but ozone cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups adjacent to any Hs that were on the double bond.

The NMR of product 3 will show the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Since the most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl, perhaps on a CH2 group next to ketones.

The question is about the coupling pattern of this H. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the H in question is probably on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling would be with two neighboring Hs. So, for a -CH2-CH2- group, each CH2 would be split into a triplet. But if the CH2 is next to a CH that's also split, the pattern could be more complex.

Wait, but in the case where a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each would be a triplet. But if it's adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs, the splitting might be more complex.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 group which is itself next to another CH2, the splitting could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 has a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- something. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, leading to O=CH-O and something else. Wait, no, ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some conjugated diene. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and product 3 is a diepoxide, but no, ozonolysis doesn't form epoxides.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the second step. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720)
Product 1 → Al(OiPr)3 → product 2
Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

Product 3's NMR: what is the coupling of the most deshielded H.

Alternative approach: perhaps product 1 is a diol, but no, IR suggests carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Epoxides can show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch, but the IR here is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene. So, product 1 is an alkene. Then, the NMR would show a doublet or triplet for the vinyl Hs. But the IR would not show a carbonyl, unless there's some conjugation. Hmm, but the IR does show a carbonyl, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe the initial elimination forms a ketone via a different mechanism. For instance, a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires a 1,2-diol. Since we started with a dihalide, perhaps it's a similar rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing the dibromide to lose two HBr molecules, forming a diketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone adamantane.

In that case, the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones. For each ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be deshielded. Since adamantane has symmetry, perhaps each CH2 would have equivalent Hs, but maybe in product 1, the structure has two equivalent CH2 groups next to the two ketones.

So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) would be one CH2 group next to a ketone. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group further away.

Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond. For example, if product 1 is a diketone, maybe under acid conditions, it loses water to form a conjugated diene.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diketone, and under acid catalysis, it undergoes a pinacol-like rearrangement, forming a conjugated diene. Because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and then a base (maybe from the solvent or generated in the reaction) would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but pinacol rearrangement typically involves 1,2-diol losing water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, it's a diketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination but starting from a diol. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has two ketone groups, and under acid, a conjugated diene is formed via a keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a dienone, where the two ketones are separated by a double bond.

Wait, let's say product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, under acid conditions, it may lose two water molecules to form a conjugated diene. So, the two ketone groups (at C1 and C3) would each lose an H2O, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? But that might not be feasible due to the structure of adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe the acid induces a ring-opening or a rearrangement that forms a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic diketone, and product 2 is a ring-opened diene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is not a diketone but a mono-ketone and an ether or something else. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would break each double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to the positions where the double bonds were.

If product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show the Hs adjacent to these carbonyls. The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl.

Now, for the coupling pattern: the H adjacent to the carbonyl (say, on a CH2 group) would be split by neighboring Hs.

Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Then, the CH2 groups would be each adjacent to a carbonyl. Each of those CH2 groups would have two Hs, and their chemical shift would be around 2-3 ppm, but the most deshielded would be at higher ppm, say around 4.79 as in product 1.

Wait, but in product 3, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be more deshielded than the others. So, let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Wait, no, that would not make sense. Maybe it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O, but that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones.

Wait, but if product 2 is a diene, say CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, then ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. So, for a diene (1,3-diene), ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, say, O=C-CH2 and CH2-CO-O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene, which would split into two carbonyl groups upon ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene, such as CH2=CH-Ad (where Ad is adamantyl). Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyl groups: O=C-CH2-Ad and O=C-CH2-Ad, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, which would break into a diketone.

Wait, considering that product 1 is a diketone, maybe product 2 is a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis would form a diepoxide or a diacid, but I think ozonolysis typically forms carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene. Ozonolysis of an internal double bond would form two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the middle, ozonolysis would split it into two aldehydes or ketones.

Alternatively, let's imagine product 2 is an alkene, perhaps a substituted ethylene. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded, appearing around 4.79 ppm as in product 1.

The Hs on these CH2 groups would couple with neighboring Hs. If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet. But if each CH2 is next to a CH that's also split, it might be a more complex pattern.

Wait, considering the initial NMR of product 1, which has 2H at 4.79 and 2H at 1.94. Perhaps the 4.79 is a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and the 1.94 is a CH2 further away.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split based on the neighboring groups. Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Therefore, each H on the central CH2 would be split by two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex pattern.

Wait, but in reality, each CH2 is only next to one other CH2 group. So, for a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on each side. Wait, no, each CH2 is next to another CH2, so the coupling would be with two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on one side (from the CH2 group) and two Hs on the other side (from the other CH2 group). So, each H would have (n+1)(m+1) splitting, where n and m are the number of neighboring Hs. But since each H is adjacent to two Hs on each side, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think: if a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would be split by two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the central CH2 would be next to a CH2 and a CH. The Hs on the CH2 next to CH would split into a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the question asks for the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would likely be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring Hs.

Another angle: what if product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative? Ozonolysis would break the ring into a diketone. For example, if product 2 is a cyclohexene ring, ozonolysis would cleave it into a six-membered ring with two ketones opposite each other.

In that case, the Hs adjacent to the ketones would each be on CH2 groups. The coupling would be between the Hs on adjacent CH2 groups. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, let me think about a specific example. Suppose product 2 is cyclohexene, which upon ozonolysis becomes adipaldehyde (O=CH-(CH2)4-CHO). The Hs on the (CH2)4 would be split based on their neighbors. The Hs next to the aldehyde groups would be on CH2 groups, each adjacent to another CH2 group.

Each of these Hs would be split by two neighboring Hs, so their NMR signal would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the aldehyde) would be a triplet.

But in the options, triplet is option A. Alternatively, perhaps it's more complex.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexene, ozonolysis would give a diacid or a diketone, depending on the conditions. But in any case, the adjacent Hs would be on CH2 groups.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form a diketone (product 1) with a carbonyl group (IR 1720). The NMR shows a CH2 group at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is adjacent to the carbonyl.

2. Product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. This likely induces a rearrangement to form a conjugated diene (product 2).

3. Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which has carbonyl groups. The Hs on the CH2 groups adjacent to these carbonyls would be the most deshielded.

4. The coupling pattern of these Hs depends on their neighboring Hs. If each is adjacent to a CH2 group, they would be triplets. If adjacent to a CH group, the pattern would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene, like a simple alkene. Ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to these would be on CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups would have neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet coupling.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a more complex diene, the coupling could be more intricate.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, it would be a triplet. But if it's adjacent to a CH group, the pattern could be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, in product 3, which is after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups. Let's imagine product 3 is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 groups between the carbonyls would each have two Hs. The central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But that's a more complex pattern, and the options include triplet of triplets as option B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentet. Wait, a pentet would arise from coupling with four neighboring Hs, which would require a CH2 adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, n = 2 (from one side) and m=2 (from the other side), leading to (2+1)*(2+1)=9 peaks, which is a nonet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is only next to a single CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH-CO. Then, each H on the CH2 would be next to a CH with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the structure after ozonolysis would depend on the starting diene. Let me think about a different structure. Suppose product 2 is a mono-ene, like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the middle. Ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyls, say, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups on either side, each with two Hs. So, each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, leading to each CH2 being next to another CH2. The middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Thus, each H would be split by two Hs on each side, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the options don't include a nonet (which would be nine peaks), but triplet of triplets implies two triplet couplings. So, each peak would split into three, and each of those would split again into three, leading to nine peaks. But that's a bit complex, and the options don't include that. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 would be next to a CH group. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the CH, leading to a doublet. But wait, each CH2 H would also be adjacent to another CH2 group on the other side. So, the splitting would be a triplet from one side and a doublet from the other, leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Which one is most likely?

If the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group (which has two Hs), then the splitting would be a triplet (from the adjacent CH2) and a doublet (from the adjacent CH). So, each H would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets (option C) or a triplet of doublets. But in the options, option C is a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, then each H would be split into a triplet (from one neighbor) and another triplet (from the other neighbor), leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

But considering the most deshielded H, it would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's say it's on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on that CH2 would be split by two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group on the other side, the Hs would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 is only next to a single CH2 group, then it's a triplet.

But given that product 3 is formed from ozonolysis of a diene, perhaps the structure has two carbonyls, each adjacent to a CH2 group, which is in turn adjacent to another CH2. So, the Hs on those CH2 groups would be next to two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH that's adjacent to two CH2 groups. Then, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: looking at the options, which one is more likely for a CH2 group between two CH2 groups.

In that case, each H would be split by two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right, leading to (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the CH2 group is only adjacent to one CH2 group and one CH group. So, each H would be split into a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, a doublet of triplets (option C) would occur if each H is split by a triplet and a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 next to a CH that is itself next to another CH2. Then, each H would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH and two Hs on the next CH2. So, it would be a doublet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should consider the possible answers. The most likely answer seems to be a triplet of triplets (option B) or a triplet (option A).

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is a single CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group which is itself next to a CH group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and two Hs on the next CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet.

Given the options, I think the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and other signals consistent with the adamantane framework.  
   - This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a diketone (1,3-diketone adamantane) through elimination of two HBr molecules.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, forming product 2.  
   - Under acid-catalyzed conditions, the diketone likely undergoes a rearrangement or dehydration to form a conjugated diene.  
   - This step introduces a double bond, preparing the molecule for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - This CH₂ group is likely flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each contributing two neighboring hydrogens.  
   - The splitting pattern arises from coupling with two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other side, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Critical evaluation of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the CH₂ group were adjacent to only one CH₂ group, but the structure suggests coupling with two CH₂ groups.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the expected splitting pattern due to coupling with two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the CH₂ group were adjacent to a CH group and a CH₂ group, which is not consistent with the structure.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not the case here.

The most consistent answer is **B) triplet of triplets**.  

Answer: B
