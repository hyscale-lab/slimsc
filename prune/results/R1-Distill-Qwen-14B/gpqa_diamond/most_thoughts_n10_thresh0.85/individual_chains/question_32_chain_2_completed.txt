Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something similar. But wait, the question is about a nucleus X which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Right, so I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

First, I think about the basic formulas from special relativity. The total energy of a moving object is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). 

So, v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma. Let's see, v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216, yeah. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784, what's that? Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So the square root is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, maybe it's better to keep more decimals for accurate calculation. Let me compute it with more precision. Let's see, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. Now sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but wait, wait, no, wait: Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Let me recall: each proton is about 1.007 u, each neutron about 1.0087 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let's compute that.

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.
Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait. The mass of Li-6 is perhaps more accurately known. Another approach: using the exact value of the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0151 u. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So the rest mass energy is m c². But for calculation, it's easier to convert the mass into energy using the relation E = mc², where c is the speed of light. But since the problem is dealing in GeV, I need to convert the mass from u to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 931.5 * 1e6 eV / c². But since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV.

So m c² for Li-6 is 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let's compute that.

6.0151 * 931.5 = let me compute 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.0151 * 931.5 is about 14.02. So total is approximately 5589 +14.02 = 5603.02 MeV. Which is 5.60302 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately: 6.0151 * 931.5.

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0151 * 931.5 = ?

0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315

0.005 * 931.5 = 4.6575

0.0001 *931.5 = 0.09315

So 9.315 +4.6575 = 13.9725 + 0.09315 = 14.06565.

So total is 5589 +14.06565 = 5603.06565 MeV.

Which is 5.60306565 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.60307 GeV.

Wait, but wait: 1 u is exactly 931.494064 MeV/c², right? So perhaps I should use 931.494 MeV/u.

So 6.0151 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0151 * 931.494 = 14.067 MeV approximately.

Total: 5588.964 +14.067 = 5603.031 MeV, which is 5.603031 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.60303 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times m c².

Gamma is approximately 3.57142857. So multiply that by 5.60303 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.57142857 *5.60303.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute 3.5 *5.6 = 19.6, but more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.60303.

Wait, perhaps it's better to break it down.

3 *5.60303 = 16.80909.

0.5714 *5.60303.

Compute 0.5 *5.60303 = 2.801515.

0.0714 *5.60303 ≈ approximately 0.4018.

So 2.801515 + 0.4018 ≈ 3.2033.

So total is 16.80909 +3.2033 = 20.01239 GeV.

Wait, but maybe that's an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise gamma.

Wait, 0.96c so v=0.96c.

Compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So 3.5714285714 * 5.603030303 GeV.

Let me compute that.

5.603030303 *3.5714285714.

Let me think of it as (5.603030303) * (3 + 0.5714285714).

Compute 5.603030303 *3 = 16.809090909 GeV.

Then 5.603030303 * 0.5714285714.

Hmm, 0.5714285714 is approximately 4/7, because 4/7 is about 0.57142857.

So 5.603030303 *4/7.

5.603030303 *4 = 22.412121212. Then divided by 7.

22.412121212 /7 ≈ approximately 3.2017316 GeV.

So total is 16.809090909 + 3.2017316 ≈ 20.0108225 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A:18.475, B:23.069, C:20.132, D:21.419.

Hmm, my approximate calculation got about 20.01 GeV, but option C is 20.132. So perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6. Let me get the exact mass of Li-6.

I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units.

Wait, another approach: the exact value of the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.0151 u. So, using that, the rest energy is 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0151 * 931.5 = let's compute.

6 * 931.5 = 5589

0.0151 *931.5 = 14.06565

Total 5603.06565 MeV, which is 5.60306565 GeV.

Wait, so m c² is 5.60306565 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma * m c².

Gamma is 3.571428571.

So 3.571428571 * 5.60306565.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

3.571428571 * 5.60306565.

Compute step by step.

Break 5.60306565 into 5 + 0.6 + 0.00306565.

But perhaps better to use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, use a more precise method:

3.571428571 * 5.60306565 = ?

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5 = 17.857142855.

3.571428571 * 0.6 = 2.1428571426.

3.571428571 * 0.00306565 ≈ about 0.011005.

Adding them together: 17.857142855 + 2.1428571426 = 20.000000 (exactly 20). Then add 0.011005, giving 20.011005 GeV.

Wait, but that's only about 20.011 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it using more precise methods, perhaps considering that 0.96c is not exactly 0.96, but perhaps I miscalculated the square root.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more accurately 6.0151 u. Wait, but perhaps the exact value is different. Let me check.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015121 u. Let me double-check that. Some sources say the atomic mass of Li-6 is around 6.015122 u.

So using 6.015122 u.

Then the rest energy is 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.015122 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005122 *931.494 = let me compute 0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.000122 *931.494 ≈ 0.11335.

So 4.65747 +0.11335=4.77082.

So 9.31494 +4.77082 =14.08576 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +14.08576 =5603.04976 MeV, which is 5.60304976 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60304976 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714285714.

Multiply 5.60304976 by 3.5714285714.

Let me compute 5.60305 *3.5714285714.

Using a calculator approach:

5.60305 *3.5714285714.

Let me do the multiplication step by step.

5 *3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.6 *3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.00305 *3.5714285714≈0.010886.

Adding them together: 17.857142857 +2.14285714284 =20.00000000, then +0.010886 =20.010886 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20.0109 GeV, which is 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, but the options are option C:20.132, and option D:21.419.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the rest mass as 6 u? Let's see what happens if I take m=6 u.

If m=6 u, then m c² =6 *931.494 MeV =5588.964 MeV =5.588964 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.588964 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute that.

5.588964 *3 =16.766892.

5.588964 *0.5714285714 ≈ ?

0.5714285714 is 4/7.

So 5.588964 *4 =22.355856.

22.355856 /7 ≈3.193694.

So total is 16.766892 +3.193694 =20. (exactly 20.000586 GeV) approximately.

Wait, but that's around 20.000586 GeV. Wait, but that's still about 20 GeV. So why is option C 20.132 not matching?

Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Let me think again.

Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Because I thought the speed is 0.96c, but maybe I should recompute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: about 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: about 1.008665 u.

So Li-6 has 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

Wait a minute, that's different from what I thought earlier. But earlier I thought the atomic mass is 6.0151 u, but perhaps that's wrong.

Wait, wait, no. Because the atomic mass includes electrons, but nuclei are considered as bare nuclei. Hmm, wait, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy (mass defect), but perhaps for a rough calculation, using the exact sum is better.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

The nucleus of Li-6 consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So total mass: 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

But the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. Hmm, so that's a discrepancy. So why is that?

Wait, because the atomic mass includes electrons. Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus electrons. But for the nucleus alone, perhaps we should consider the mass without the electrons. But wait, the nucleus is Li-6, so the atomic mass of Li-6 includes the electrons, but in the context of a collider, the nucleus is likely being considered as a bare nucleus. Hmm, no, in reality, the nucleus is a bare nucleus when it's being accelerated, right? So the mass would be the sum of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy (mass defect).

Hmm, but if I use the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.01512 u, then the mass of the nucleus is 6.01512 u.

Wait, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Wait, no. Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus the electrons. For a neutral atom, each Li atom has 3 electrons. So perhaps the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u. But the mass of the electrons is 3 * (electron mass).

The electron mass is about 0.00054858 u per electron. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass would be 6.01512 u - 0.00164574 u =6.013474 u.

Wait, but that's still different from the sum of protons and neutrons, which we calculated as 6.047823 u. So something's wrong here.

Ah, because when you sum the masses of the protons and neutrons, you get a higher value than the actual nucleus mass due to mass defect (binding energy). So the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum.

So perhaps the correct mass is indeed 6.01512 u minus the electrons' mass, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the atomic mass includes the electrons. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.01512 u. Because the atomic mass includes the nucleus and the electrons, so the nucleus is lighter than the atomic mass. So for a bare nucleus, perhaps the mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron's mass is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus's mass would be 6.01512 u (atomic mass) minus 0.00164574 u. So 6.01512 -0.00164574=6.013474 u. So the nucleus mass is approximately 6.013474 u.

Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of protons and neutrons was 6.047823 u, which is higher. But that's because when you just sum the individual masses, you get a larger mass than the nucleus due to binding energy. So the actual nucleus mass is 6.013474 u.

But perhaps for this problem, the exact value is given as 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass as 6 u. Let me see: if I take m=6 u, then m c² is 6 *931.494 MeV =5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.588964 *3.5714285714=?

Let me compute this precisely.

5.588964 *3.5714285714.

Well, 5 *3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.588964 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute 0.5 *3.5714285714 =1.7857142857.

0.088964 *3.5714285714 ≈0.316285714.

So 1.7857142857 +0.316285714 ≈2.102.

So total would be 17.857142857 +2.102=19.959142857 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.959 GeV.

But none of the options are exactly that. The closest is option C:20.132.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is 6.01512 u, which is the atomic mass, and the electrons are considered part of the nucleus? That can't be right. No, the nucleus doesn't include the electrons; the electrons are in the atom. So perhaps the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach. Maybe the problem expects the rest mass of the nucleus to be 6 u, which is a common approximation. So if m is 6 u, then m c² is 5.588964 GeV. Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.588964 *3.5714285714 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

Breaking 3.5714285714 into 3 + 0.5714285714.

5.588964 *3 =16.766892.

5.588964 *0.5714285714.

Well, 0.5714285714 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.588964 *4 =22.355856.

22.355856 /7 ≈3.193693714.

So 16.766892 +3.193693714 =20. (exactly 20.000585714 GeV) approximately.

That's about 20.0006 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise v.

Wait, the speed is 0.96c, so v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

No mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, that's a possibility. Wait, the question says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

Wait, energy in particle colliders is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's given as the total energy. Hmm, but in high-energy physics, when they talk about beam energy, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, wait. In accelerators, the energy is usually the kinetic energy added to the rest mass. So the total energy is rest mass plus kinetic energy. But sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy as the 'energy' of the particle. So perhaps I should consider whether the question is asking for the kinetic energy or the total energy.

If the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then it's (gamma -1) m c².

So if I were to compute the kinetic energy, it would be (3.5714285714 -1) *5.60304976 GeV.

Which is 2.5714285714 *5.60304976.

Let me compute that.

2.5714285714 *5.60304976.

Hmm, 2 *5.60304976 =11.20609952.

0.5714285714 *5.60304976.

0.5 *5.60304976=2.80152488.

0.0714285714 *5.60304976 ≈0.4017.

So 2.8015 +0.4017=3.2032.

Total is 11.20609952 +3.2032=14.4093 GeV.

But that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

So the question must be asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, but the options are higher than 20 GeV. Wait, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, but when I calculated using m=6.01512 u, I got about 20.01 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I'm missing something in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the accurate calculation is needed for gamma.

Wait, I can compute gamma using more precise methods. For example, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma when v=0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for v.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

v/c =0.96.

v²/c² =0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of the nucleus mass is incorrect. Let me think again.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015121 u.

The nucleus of Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so the sum of their masses is 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u.

But the actual nucleus mass is less due to binding energy. So the actual nucleus mass is 6.015121 u minus the mass of the electrons in the atom.

Wait, the atom has 3 electrons, each of 0.00054858 u, so 3*0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.015121 u (atomic mass) minus 0.00164574 u.

Which is approximately 6.013475 u.

So m=6.013475 u.

Then, m c² =6.013475 *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.013475 *931.494 = let me compute.

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.003475 *931.494 =?

0.003 *931.494=2.794482.

0.000475 *931.494 ≈0.44309.

So 2.794482 +0.44309=3.237572.

So 9.31494 +3.237572=12.552512 MeV.

So total m c² is 5588.964 +12.552512 =5601.516512 MeV =5.601516512 GeV.

So m c² ≈5.601517 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So total energy E = gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.601517 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714285714 *5.601517.

Let me compute 3 *5.601517 =16.804551.

0.5714285714 *5.601517.

Compute 0.5 *5.601517=2.8007585.

0.0714285714 *5.601517 ≈0.4017.

So 2.8007585 +0.4017=3.2024585.

Adding to 16.804551 gives 16.804551 +3.2024585=20.0070095 GeV.

That's about 20.007 GeV.

Hmm, but the option C is 20.132 GeV. That's higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me check. Oh, I think the exact value may be 6.015122 u.

Wait, if Li-6's atomic mass is 6.015122 u, then the nucleus mass is 6.015122 - 3*(0.00054858) =6.015122 -0.00164574=6.01347626 u.

Then, m c² =6.01347626 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01347626 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.00347626 *931.494. Let's compute:

0.003 *931.494=2.794482.

0.00047626 *931.494 ≈0.44405.

So 2.794482+0.44405=3.238532.

Total for 0.01347626 *931.494 =9.31494 +3.238532 =12.553472 MeV.

So m c² is 5588.964 +12.553472=5601.517472 MeV=5.601517472 GeV.

Then, E =3.5714285714 *5.601517472.

Compute:

3 *5.601517472=16.804552416.

0.5714285714 *5.601517472.

Compute 0.5 *5.601517472=2.800758736.

0.0714285714 *5.601517472≈0.4017.

So 2.800758736 +0.4017=3.202458736.

Adding to 16.804552416 gives 20.00701115 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.007 GeV. So I'm getting about 20.007 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula with beta and gamma.

Wait, another approach: beta is 0.96, so beta =v/c=0.96.

gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

The total energy E is gamma * m c².

If m is 6.015122 u - electrons.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as 6 u. Let me try that.

m=6 u.

gamma=3.5714285714.

E=3.5714285714*6 *931.494 MeV.

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV =5.588964 GeV.

E=3.5714285714 *5.588964 GeV.

Let's compute:

3 *5.588964=16.766892.

0.5714285714 *5.588964 ≈.

0.5*5.588964=2.794482.

0.0714285714 *5.588964≈0.4017.

So 2.794482 +0.4017=3.196182.

Total E=16.766892 +3.196182=20. (exactly 20.000074 GeV) approximately.

So that's about 20.00007 GeV.

But option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. So let me compute that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m c².

If m=6.01347626 u, so m c²=5.601517472 GeV.

gamma=3.5714285714.

K=(3.5714285714 -1)*5.601517472.

=2.5714285714 *5.601517472.

Calculating:

2 *5.601517472=11.20303494.

0.5714285714 *5.601517472.

0.5 *5.601517472=2.800758736.

0.0714285714 *5.601517472≈0.4017.

So 2.800758736 +0.4017=3.202458736.

Total K=11.20303494 +3.202458736=14.40549368 GeV.

But that's about 14.4 GeV, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the exact value of gamma * m c² with precise values.

m =6.01347626 u.

m c² =6.01347626 *931.494 MeV = let's compute.

6.01347626 *931.494.

= (6 +0.01347626) *931.494.

=6*931.494 +0.01347626 *931.494.

=5588.964 +12.553472.

=5601.517472 MeV=5.601517472 GeV.

gamma=3.5714285714.

E=3.5714285714 *5.601517472.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 *5.601517472.

I'll do this multiplication step by step.

3.5714285714 ×5.601517472.

Let me write this as:

3.5714285714 ×5.601517472 = ?

I can compute this using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, use the fact that 3.5714285714 is 25/7.

Because 25/7 ≈3.5714285714.

So E = (25/7) *5.601517472.

Compute 5.601517472 ÷7 = approximately 0.8002167817.

Multiply by 25: 0.8002167817 *25=20.00541954 GeV.

Ah! So that's approximately 20.0054 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 25/7 *5.601517472.

5.601517472 ÷7 = 0.8002167817.

0.8002167817 *25=20.00541954 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.0054 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the mass calculation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass as 6.015122 u without subtracting the electrons, which would be incorrect but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

So let's try that.

m=6.015122 u.

m c²=6.015122 *931.494 MeV = ?

6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.015122 *931.494=14.08576.

So m c²=5588.964 +14.08576=5603.04976 MeV=5.60304976 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.5714285714 *5.60304976.

Compute:

5.60304976 ×3.5714285714.

Again, considering 3.5714285714=25/7.

So 5.60304976 × (25/7) = (5.60304976 /7) *25.

5.60304976 ÷7 ≈0.80043568.

0.80043568 ×25=20.010892 GeV.

So E≈20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses an approximate gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precise v.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Which is 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No, that's precise.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the energy in the center-of-mass frame or something else. But I think not; the question is about the energy of each nucleus in the collider, so it's the total energy per nucleus.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than my calculated 20.01 GeV. Perhaps I should consider more precise values for the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the masses of the proton and neutron.

Proton mass: m_p =1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: m_n=1.008665 u.

Number of protons and neutrons in Li-6: 3 each.

So total mass before binding: 3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

The actual mass of the nucleus is 6.015122 u.

So the difference is 6.047823 -6.015122=0.032701 u, which is the binding energy.

So the nucleus mass is 6.015122 u.

So m c²=6.015122 *931.494 MeV=5603.04976 MeV=5.60304976 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E=5.60304976 *3.5714285714.

Again, compute 5.60304976 ×3.5714285714.

3.5714285714 is 25/7.

So 5.60304976 ÷7=0.80043568.

0.80043568 ×25=20.010892 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0109 GeV.

Wait, but option C is 20.132. I'm not getting that. Maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, but I have been using 3.5714285714, which is an exact fraction. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma using more precise decimal places.

Let me compute gamma using more precise v.

v=0.96.

v²=0.9216.

1 -v²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering relativistic energy including the rest mass but using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using beta.

Beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=3.5714285714.

E=gamma * m c².

But I'm getting E≈20.01 GeV, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is taken as 6.941 g/mol? No, that doesn't make sense. That's the atomic weight, but the mass is in u.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering the binding energy. That would give m=6.047823 u.

Then m c²=6.047823 *931.494 MeV= ?

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494 ≈44.64 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964 +44.64=5633.604 MeV=5.633604 GeV.

Then E=3.5714285714 *5.633604 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633604=16.900812.

0.5714285714 *5.633604=?

0.5 *5.633604=2.816802.

0.0714285714 *5.633604≈0.4042.

So 2.816802 +0.4042=3.221002.

So E=16.900812+3.221002=20.121814 GeV.

Ah! Now that's about 20.1218 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem is expecting to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering the binding energy, i.e., m=6.047823 u.

In that case, E= gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.633604 GeV=20.1218 GeV, which rounds to 20.122 GeV. But the option C is 20.132, which is very close.

So perhaps that's the intended approach. The problem might be expecting the use of individual nucleon masses, without accounting for the binding energy. That would explain why the answer is around 20.13 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.015122 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.015122 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5603.05 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.01 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Consider alternative interpretations
The calculated energy of \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, if the problem assumes the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without accounting for binding energy, the rest mass becomes \( 6.047823 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.047823 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5633.60 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6336 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6336 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result is very close to option **C (20.132 GeV)**, suggesting that the problem may be using the sum of nucleon masses without accounting for binding energy.

### Final Answer:
Based on the calculations, the energy of the RHIC is approximately **20.132 GeV**, corresponding to option **C**.

**Answer: C**
