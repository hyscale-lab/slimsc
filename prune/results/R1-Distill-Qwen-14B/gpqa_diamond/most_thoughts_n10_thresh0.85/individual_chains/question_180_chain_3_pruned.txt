Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy of a system with charges. Alright, let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And they're talking about an isolated system, which probably means we don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has one charge, and all the others are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. I think I need to calculate the potential energy of this system, right?

Wait, potential energy between charges. So for a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, since all the 12 charges are identical, maybe there's a way to calculate this without getting bogged down in each pair.

Let me think. The charge at P is fixed, so it's not moving. The other charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, are all the other charges arranged in a way that they're each 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other? Oh, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but doesn't specify their arrangement among themselves. Oh, but for potential energy, each pair contributes, so I need to consider all the interactions between the 12 charges as well.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. Hmm. So maybe the charges can be arranged in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. But wait, in an isolated system, the charges can't be moved without work done, but here the setup is given as fixed: 12 charges at 2 m from P, the 13th at P. So I think the arrangement is fixed, so we just calculate the potential energy for that configuration.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let's read the question again. It says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the configuration is fixed; we don't get to choose where to place them. So we have to compute the potential energy for this fixed setup.

So the system has two parts: the potential between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, and
