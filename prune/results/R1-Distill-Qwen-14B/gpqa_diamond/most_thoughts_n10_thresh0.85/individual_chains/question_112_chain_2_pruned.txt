Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. And |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, I think that means |up> is the eigenstate with spin up along z, and |down> is the spin down along z. So, they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The question is asking for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix elements Aij are given: Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 system (since we're talking about up and down), the matrix would look like [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0], right? Because the diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Hmm. So the operator is represented by a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Let me think. Oh, wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

The eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if you have an operator that's a multiple of σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So, the eigenstates of σ_x are the states where spin is in the x-direction. The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (times hbar/2, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x). Wait, no: σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when we measure using operator A.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I'll need to normalize this state. Because the question says it's proportional, so it's just a matter of finding the normalization constant.

Let me compute the norm of |alpha>. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So, the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), so its absolute value squared is |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i), so |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of A, which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Wait, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x
