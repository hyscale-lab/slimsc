Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Let's see what I remember about particle physics and decay processes.

The problem says the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how directly that affects the decay possibilities. Maybe the Lagrangian tells me which fermions X can interact with. The Lagrangian term is written as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so X interacts with fermions f, and the coupling is proportional to λ. So the fermions f that X can decay into are those that are present in this term.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays. So I should think about the energy required for each possible decay. The mass of X is 6 GeV. Each decay product must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV to be allowed.

So what are the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into? Let's list all the possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

Fermions include quarks of different flavors and leptons. The quarks are u, d, c, s, b, t. But wait, top quark is really heavy, mass around 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quark pairs because 6 GeV is much less than twice the top mass. So top is out.

Leptons are e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles. So the possible pairs are:

- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-
- u u-bar
- d d-bar
- s s-bar
- c c-bar
- b b-bar

Wait, but the mass of each fermion has to be considered. Because the decay can only happen if the sum of the rest masses of the products is less than the mass of X.

So for each possible fermion pair, the combined rest mass needs to be less than 6 GeV?

Wait, but actually, in particle physics, the decay is allowed if the sum of the rest masses is less than the mass of the decaying particle. Because you have to have enough energy to create them. So for a pair of particles, each with mass m, the sum is 2m. So 2m < 6 GeV.

So let's list each fermion and their masses.
