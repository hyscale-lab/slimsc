Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. So, the first thing I need to understand is what the pp-III branch is and what its role is in neutrino production.

I remember that in the Sun, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing helium-4 nuclei. Oh wait, right, the pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing deuterium, and it's part of the proton-proton chain that eventually leads to helium. The pp-III branch is a specific part where three helium-4 nuclei combine to form carbon-12.

Now, neutrinos are produced in various steps of these processes. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in beta decay steps. Specifically, the pp-III branch is associated with the production of neutrinos in the CNO cycle? Wait, no, isn't the CNO cycle separate? Wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos in the beta decay steps. In the pp chain, two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses, and then a neutron and a positron, which produces a neutrino. So the main neutrinos are from the beta decay steps in the pp chain. But the pp-III branch is the part where three helium-3 nuclei (each made from two protons and a neutron) combine to form carbon-12. So this is a later step in the chain, but how does it relate to neutrino production?

Oh wait, the pp-III branch is actually a side reaction. The primary chain is the pp-I, which converts protons into deuterium, then into helium-3, then two helium-3s combine into carbon-12 via the pp-III branch. So the pp-III branch is crucial for the fusion process, but how does it produce neutrinos?

Wait, I think neutrinos come from the beta decay steps in the initial parts of the proton-proton chain. For example, in the first step, two protons combine to form deuterium, emitting positrons and neutrinos. So that's the main source of solar neutrinos, especially the 7 Be neutrinos and the pep neutrinos. But I'm a bit confused about where the pp-III branch comes into neutrino emission.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch isn't directly a source of high-energy neutrinos. Let me think. Oh, wait, perhaps the neutrinos are produced in the initial steps of the proton-proton chain, and the pp-III branch doesn't contribute directly to neutrino production but affects the overall fusion rate. So if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the overall fusion rate, thereby changing the number of neutrinos emitted?

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So, the pp-III is responsible for producing carbon-12 from three helium-3 nuclei. Without the pp-III branch, the fusion process would be affected. But would that stop the production of neutrinos in the earlier steps?

Hmm, the Sun's fusion processes are in equilibrium, so if the pp-III branch stops, then the earlier steps would have less fuel to continue. Because the pp-III is necessary for the fusion of helium-3 into carbon, if that stops, the helium-3 builds up. So the earlier steps (like the production of deuterium and helium-3) might continue, but since the pp-III can't proceed, the fusion chain is blocked. 

But wait, the pp-I and pp-II branches are part of the main chain. The pp-III is the branch where three He-3 combine into C-12. So if that stops, the main chain is blocked, because the He-3 can't continue. So the overall fusion would slow down, which would reduce the number of neutrinos produced because the earlier steps are part of the fusion process. 

But the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what neutrinos are in these energy ranges?

I remember that the solar neutrinos come from several processes: the dominant ones are the CNO cycle and the proton-proton chain. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like the 13.7 MeV neutrinos from the decay of 13 C in the CNO cycle. But those are higher energy, so they're in different bands. 

Wait, the main neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy. For instance, the 7 Be neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, and the pep neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV. But those are much lower than the 700 keV mentioned in the question. So maybe the bands in the question are referring to some other neutrino process.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the question is referring to the spectrum of neutrinos from the Sun. The solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 1 MeV, but there is a continuous distribution. The bands given are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So they're within the range where the pp chain neutrinos would be.

But why would the pp-III branch stopping affect the flux in these bands? Because the production of these neutrinos comes from earlier steps in the chain, not from the pp-III itself.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of the main fusion process, so if it stops, the overall fusion rate would decrease, leading to fewer neutrinos overall. But the question is about the ratio between two specific bands. So if the ratio remains the same, the flux ratio would be 1. But if the pp-III stopping affects the production of higher energy neutrinos more than lower ones, then the ratio would change.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for a specific part of the neutrino spectrum. Like, perhaps the higher energy neutrinos (like in 800-900 keV) are produced more in the pp-III branch than the lower energy ones.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

The pp-III branch is a step in the fusion process. If it stops, the fusion process would be halted, but perhaps the earlier steps (like the production of deuterium and He-3) continue until the available fuel is exhausted. So the initial steps continue, but without the pp-III, the overall fusion rate decreases. 

Wait, but the flux of neutrinos is determined by the rate of the processes that produce them. So if the pp-III stops, the main fusion process is blocked, so the rate of deuterium production (which leads to He-3) would decrease. Hmm, no, because the initial steps (pp-I and pp-II) are before the pp-III. So wait, if the pp-III is stopped, the previous steps can't continue because the chain is blocked.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the fusion process steps:

1. Two protons (p) fuse to form a deuterium (D) and emit a positron and a neutrino. This is the pp-I branch.
2. Another proton fuses with deuterium to form a tritium (T) isotope, but this is unstable and beta decays to helium-3 (He-3). This is the pp-II branch.
3. Two He-3 nuclei fuse to form a He-4 nucleus and two protons. This is the pp-III branch.

Wait, no, that's not the usual structure. Let me correct. The main proton-proton chain goes like this:

- Two protons fuse to form deuterium (pp-I), emitting a positron and neutrino (this is the main source of the 1.4 MeV neutrinos, the 7 Be neutrinos).
- Then, the deuterium fuses with another proton to form tritium (pp-II), which then beta decays to He-3.
- Then, two He-3 nuclei can either combine to form He-4 (the pp-III branch) or each He-3 can capture a proton to form two He-4 (but that's another process, perhaps involving the CNO cycle? Not sure.)

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Proton + Proton → Deuterium + positron + neutrino (pp-I)
Deuterium + Proton → Tritium, which beta decays to He-3 (pp-II)
Two He-3 → He-4 + two protons (pp-III)

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the two He-3 can't combine, so the fusion process is blocked. So the He-3 builds up, which would affect the earlier steps because the fusion isn't proceeding. So the production of He-3 would continue until the available protons are used up in the earlier steps.

Wait, but the production of He-3 is from the pp-II branch, so if the pp-III branch is blocked, the earlier steps (pp-I and pp-II) can still proceed, but without the pp-III, the He-3 can't fuse into He-4, so the He-3 accumulates. But how does this affect the production of neutrinos?

The neutrinos come from the beta decay steps in the pp chain, which are the pp-I and pp-II steps. So if the pp-III is blocked, the production of He-3 would continue because the steps before pp-III (pp-I and pp-II) are still happening. But without the pp-III, the He-3 can't fuse further, so the overall fusion rate would decrease because the chain is blocked at that point.

Wait, but the neutrinos are produced in the earlier steps, so if the pp-III is stopped, the fusion process would continue until the available protons are exhausted, but perhaps the rate slows down. So the overall number of neutrinos produced would decrease, but the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands.

So, the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) versus 800-900 keV (band 2). If the pp-III branch is stopped, perhaps it affects the production of higher-energy neutrinos more than lower ones. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the higher energy neutrinos are produced in a different part of the process, like in the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III is stopped, maybe the CNO cycle is affected.

Wait, the CNO cycle is a separate fusion process, right? So if the pp-III is blocked, does that affect the CNO cycle? I'm a bit confused about that. The CNO cycle is another hydrogen burning process that occurs in higher temperature regions of the Sun, but the proton-proton chain is the primary process in the Sun since its core isn't hot enough for the CNO cycle to dominate.

Wait, no, the CNO cycle is more prominent in higher-mass stars. The Sun's
