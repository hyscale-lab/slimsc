Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. Wait, same direction as the beam and moving towards the observer? That might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify: the beam is going in a direction, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, but towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab, watching the glass moving towards them.

I need to find the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium (glass) is moving. So I think this involves some sort of relative velocity addition.

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly, but I think in this problem, maybe we can treat it non-relativistically since v is probably much less than c. Because if v is small compared to c, we can use the Galilean transformations instead of the Lorentz ones. That would simplify things.

So, the speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n (since the speed in the medium is c divided by the refractive index). But now the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. So how does that affect the speed of the light as observed?

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at v, what's the light's speed?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So, using the velocity addition formula from Galilean relativity, the lab's frame would measure the light's speed as u' = u Â± v, depending on directions.

Wait, the direction is a bit tricky. So, in the glass frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So from the glass's point of view, the beam is moving forward at c/n.

Wait, no, wait. Let's define the direction. Let's say the light is moving in the positive x-direction
