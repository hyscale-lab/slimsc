Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question gives a density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the options are about its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

Wait, what's a density matrix look like for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is 2x2. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out.

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0; |1><1| is diagonal 0,1. So adding them gives a matrix with 1 and 1 on the diagonal, then dividing by 2, I get rho as [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That looks familiar—it's the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Geometrical position—what does that mean? Oh, right, the Bloch sphere representation. The density matrix for a qubit can be mapped to a point on the Bloch sphere, which is a way to visualize quantum states.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So the Bloch vector r determines where the state is on the sphere. For a pure state, the vector r would have length 1, and for a mixed state, it's shorter.

In the given rho, let me compute the components. The equation is rho = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's write out I as the 2x2 identity matrix. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

So rho = [ I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz ] / 2.

Let me calculate each term. I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So substituting into rho: (1/2) * [ [1,0;0,1] + rx [0,1;1,0] + ry [0,-i;i,0] + rz [1,0;0,-1] ].

Let me compute that matrix. The (1,1) element is (1/2)(1 + rz). The (2,2) element is (1/2)(1 - rz). The (1,2) element is (1/2)(rx - i ry), and (2,1) is (1/2)(rx + i ry).

Wait, but the given rho is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal. So the off-diagonal elements must be zero
