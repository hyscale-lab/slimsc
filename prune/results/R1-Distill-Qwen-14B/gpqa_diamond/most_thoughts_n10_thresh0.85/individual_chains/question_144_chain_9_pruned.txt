Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question states that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for very long before decaying. The mean decay distance would depend on how long they live, right? Or more precisely, their lifetime and their speed.

The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, I think the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ of the particle through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for particles, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So approximately, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the particle's velocity. Oh wait, but particles like mesons are moving at relativistic speeds, so their velocity is close to the speed of light. So the mean decay distance should be roughly c * τ.

But wait, how do I calculate that? Let me jot down the formulas.

First, let's compute the lifetime τ. The width Γ is given in MeV, and ħ (reduced Planck's constant) is usually given in units of energy times time. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, Γ is in MeV, so I need to convert units properly.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Then, τ = ħ / Γ. Substituting, τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's a very short lifetime.

Next, the velocity. Since the production energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV, I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy formula. The energy E of a particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but E is already given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so perhaps I can compute γ as E_X / m_X. Let me see: E_X =8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β is v/c. So β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me calculate that.

First, 1/γ² is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance is c * τ. Wait, no, because the lifetime is τ, and the speed is v, so the distance should be v * τ. But wait, v is in m/s, and τ is in seconds, so when I multiply, the units should be meters.

So let me compute v * τ: (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ (2.966e8) * (2.056875e-24) ≈ 6.103e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.1e-16 m. But looking at the options, the possible answers are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16. Hmm, my calculation gives 6e-16, which isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me recheck each step.

First, calculating τ: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yes, that seems right.

Then, calculating γ: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.(6). That's correct.

Calculating beta: sqrt(1 - 1/(6.6667)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v = 0.9887c. Correct.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

Then, decay distance: v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = let me compute that more accurately.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (6.103) * 1e-16 = about 6.103e-16 m.

Hmm, none of the options match that. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is Γ, and the lifetime is τ ≈ ħ / (Γ c²) ? No, I think the formula is Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But perhaps I forgot to account for the units correctly. Let me check the units.

Γ is in GeV, and ħ is in GeV·s. So τ = (GeV·s) / GeV = seconds. That's correct.

Wait another thought: the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving at a high gamma factor. So the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. But wait, I think I've already accounted for that by calculating gamma and using v= beta c.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be using the mean lifetime as τ = ħ/(Γ c^2) ? No, I think that's not correct. Because the natural units in particle physics often set c=1, but when converting into meters, we have to include c.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The uncertainty principle gives Γ τ ≈ ħ. But actually, the full equation is Γ τ ≈ ħ, where Γ is in energy units and τ in seconds.

But perhaps I should be converting ħ into the correct units. Let me double-check the value of ħ.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So yes, that's correct.

So τ is ħ / Γ, which is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.0568e-24 s.

So that part seems correct.

Then, the velocity is approximately 0.9887c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, distance is v * tau = 2.966e8 * 2.0568e-24 = let's compute this again.

2.966e8 = 2.966 x 1e8 = 2.966 x 10^8.

2.0568e-24 = 2.0568 x10^-24.

Multiply them: 2.966 * 2.0568 = Approximately 6.103.

Then, 10^8 * 10^-24 =10^-16.

So the product is 6.103e-16 m. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is about 4e-16. My calculation is about 6e-16. So that's not matching. Did I make a mistake in beta?

Wait, let me recalculate beta more accurately. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666...

Gamma squared is (6.666666)^2 = approximately 44.444444.

Wait: 6.666666 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 =0.0225.

So 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 -0.0225 =0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, but perhaps more accurately, let's compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

We know that 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, but 0.9887^2 = ?

Wait, let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.9887 * 0.9887 ≈ (0.98)^2 + 2 *0.98 *0.0087 + (0.0087)^2

= 0.9604 + 0.016932 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9774.

Yes, so sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

So beta is correct.

Hmm, so why is my calculation not matching any of the options? Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay length is c * τ, but I thought it's v * τ. Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at v, so the distance is v * τ. Oh wait, but wait, the lifetime τ is the lifetime in the lab frame, because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is a Lorentz-invariant quantity, but the lifetime is as measured in the rest frame. Wait, no, actually, the width Γ is the same in all frames because it's the total decay rate. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the decay width Γ is the same in the rest frame and in the lab frame, but the lifetime τ is different between frames. Wait, no, the proper lifetime (rest frame) is τ0 = ħ/(Γ), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. Because the decay width Γ is related to the proper lifetime τ0 by Γ= ħ/τ0. So the observed lifetime is τ = gamma * tau0.

Wait, wait, I think I mixed up the frames earlier. Let me clarify. The particle's lifetime as measured in its rest frame is tau0 = ħ/Γ. But when the particle is moving at a high velocity, the lab frame observes a longer lifetime due to time dilation. Because time in the moving frame (particle's frame) runs slower. So the lab frame would see the lifetime as tau = gamma * tau0.

Wait, that's a key point I might have messed up earlier. Because in the rest frame of the particle, the lifetime is tau0, but in the lab frame, which sees the particle moving, the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau0.

So that changes things. Because earlier I used tau = ħ/Γ, which is tau0, but then I used v * tau0, which is incorrect. The correct tau in the lab frame is gamma * tau0.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau0.

Then, the decay distance is v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau0.

Tau0 is ħ/(Gamma).

So v * gamma * (ħ / Gamma) = v * (gamma * ħ) / Gamma.

But wait, let's compute this again.

Tau0 = ħ / Gamma.

Tau_lab = gamma * tau0 = gamma * ħ / Gamma.

So decay distance L = v * tau_lab = v * (gamma * ħ) / Gamma.

But v = beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma * ħ / Gamma.

But gamma = E/mc², since E = gamma m c².

Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) )= 8/(1.2) =6.666... as before.

But let me proceed.

So, L = beta c gamma ħ / Gamma.

We can write beta gamma as (v/c) * gamma = gamma beta.

Which is the same as (gamma beta) c.

Wait, but gamma beta is equal to (gamma^2 -1 )^(1/2) = ( ( (gamma)^2 ) -1 )^0.5.

Wait, because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So gamma beta = sqrt( gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 ) )

So in our case, Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So putting it all together:

L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ) / Gamma.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma.

gamma is 6.666..., beta is 0.9887.

So beta gamma=6.666... * 0.9887 ≈ 6.666 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.591.

Hmm.

Then, c * ħ is the speed of light times the Planck constant.

But let's compute this step by step.

Compute beta gamma first: 6.666 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591.

Then,

L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ) / Gamma.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So,

L = 6.591 * (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

Wait, let's compute the numerator:

3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 3e8 *6.582e-25 * m GeV.

Wait, units: GeV is energy, but we have m/s * GeV·s, which is m GeV.

Wait, but actually, let me compute the numbers:

3e8 *6.582e-25 = 3 *6.582e-17 = 19.746e-17 = 1.9746e-16.

So, the numerator is 6.591 * 1.9746e-16 m·GeV.

Divide by 0.32 GeV: 6.591 * (1.9746e-16 / 0.32 ) m.

Compute 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 = approx 6.1706e-16.

Multiply by 6.591: 6.1706e-16 *6.591 ≈40.97e-16 m, which is 4.097e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.1e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.

Hmm, 4.1e-15 m is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). Let me compute more accurately.

Let me recompute the steps with more precise numbers.

First, compute beta gamma accurately.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988714.

beta = 0.988714.

beta gamma = 6.66666666667 * 0.988714 ≈6.5913.

Next, compute c * ħ.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So c * ħ = 3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV·s =3e8 *6.582e-25 = (3 *6.582) *1e8-25 =19.746 * 1e-17 =1.9746e-16 m·GeV.

Now, divide by Gamma (0.32 GeV):

1.9746e-16 m·GeV / 0.32 GeV = (1.9746 / 0.32 )e-16 m =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma (6.5913):

6.170625e-16 m *6.5913 ≈40.95e-16 m =4.095e-15 m.

So L ≈4.095e-15 m, which is approximately 4.095e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15 m. So option B is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beta gamma product.

Let me compute beta gamma again with more precise numbers.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988714245.
