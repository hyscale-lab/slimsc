Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. Oh right, the formula for K is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/ something) multiplied by (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(something). No, maybe I should remember the simplified version when M_planet is much smaller than M_star, which is the case here since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun.

So the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (P * (1 - e^2)^(1.5) ) ) ] ) ]^(1/ something)

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is K = ( (G * (M_planet) )^(1/3) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) ) * (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their mass is much smaller than the star, so M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, let's think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

K = [ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) ] / [ ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) * c ] ]

Wait, perhaps another way. I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Alternatively, I remember that for the same star, a larger K implies a more massive planet or a shorter period, because the star moves faster in response.

Wait, no, the orbital velocity of the star (K) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. For a given planet mass, a shorter period would mean a larger K. Because if the planet is orbiting quickly, the star has to move more rapidly in the opposite direction to balance the system's center of mass. So for the same planet mass, a shorter period would mean a larger K.

But in this problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_planet is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, because the formula for K has P to the power of -1/3.

Wait, let's get back. The formula I found before states that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

So let's write that as K ∝ (M_p) / (M_s^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

Since both M_p and M_s are the same for both stars, K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^{1/3}

Wait no, because if K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, then K ∝ 1 / P^{1/3}. So K1 = C / P1^{1/3}, K2 = C / P2^{1/3}, where C is a constant for the same M_p and M_s.

So K1 / K2 = [ C / P1^{1/3} ] / [ C / P2^{1/3} ] = (P2 / P1 )^{1/3}

But wait, the given data is K1 = 5 milliangstrom, K2 =7 milliangstrom.

Wait, the
