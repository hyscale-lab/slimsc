Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me walk through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll tackle each step one by one.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1

1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a very rigid structure. When it has two bromine atoms at 1 and 3 positions, heating with KOH (a strong base) probably leads to an elimination reaction. Let me think about that. KOH is often used in dehydrohalogenation, so maybe it's an E2 elimination.

In an elimination reaction, two adjacent bromines would typically lead to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 positions on adamantane... What's the structure of adamantane? It's like a diamond cubic structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are actually on opposite faces? Wait, no, maybe adjacent. Let me visualize: the adamantane molecule has four carbons in a chair-like structure. Positions 1 and 3 are on the same face but across from each other, maybe. Or perhaps they are adjacent in a way that allows for elimination.

Wait, perhaps when you eliminate two bromides, you form a double bond. Since the molecule is symmetric, the product could be a diene or a cyclopropane? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3. If they're on adjacent carbons, which they are in adamantane, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or maybe a conjugated diene.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is likely an -OH group or an ether. But wait, KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Or elimination.

Alternatively, KOH could lead to a substitution where the bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH... Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene.

Wait, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, probably a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Because in an epoxide, the protons are around 3-4 ppm, but 4.79 is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a characteristic absorbance at 172
