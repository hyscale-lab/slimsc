Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... the problem is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, but the state isn't normalized yet. So, let's find the normalization factor.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients. Let's calculate each one.

The absolute square of (1 + i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a^2 + b^2.

For (2 - i), the absolute square is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). Wait, no. Wait, the state is proportional, so the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares. So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Okay, next part: the operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the problem is about spin, which is two-level. So the matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, because when i≠j, the elements are hbar/2. So yes, the operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is given, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. So, |alpha> is in the computational basis (|up> and |down>), but the operator in question is not the Pauli z matrix, which would have eigenstates |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of this operator are different, and the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator and find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find probabilities.

So let me think about the operator A. Its matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Hmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λI)=0. So:

| -λ    hbar/2   |
| hbar/2   -λ  |  = 0.

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0. So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that again. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) =0. So λ² = hbar²/4, so λ is ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors can be found. For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) v = 0 → [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] v = 0.

This gives the equations:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [1; 1]. Similarly for λ = -hbar/2: the equations become (hbar/2) v1 - (hbar/2) v2=0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are [1; -1].

Wait, but wait, the operator's matrix is off-diagonal elements of hbar/2. So the eigenstates are:

For λ = hbar/2: (1,1)/sqrt(2) → because they're normalized.

For λ = -hbar/2: (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when you have the matrix with 0 on diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal, the eigenstates are those symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

So the operator's eigenstates are these |+> and |-> states.

So the problem now is to express the state |alpha> in terms of these |+> and |-> states. Then the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue will be the square of the coefficients in this expansion.

So let's write |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7) and b=(2 - i)/sqrt(7).

We can write |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's express |alpha> as c|+> + d|->.

So:

a|up> + b|down> = c (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + d (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let's equate the coefficients for |up> and |down>:

For |up>:

a = [c + d ] / sqrt(2).

For |down>:

b = [c - d ] / sqrt(2).

So, we can solve for c and d.

Let me write the two equations:

c + d = a * sqrt(2).

c - d = b * sqrt(2).

Adding these two equations: 2c = (a + b) sqrt(2) → c = (a + b) sqrt(2) / 2.

Subtracting: 2d = (a - b) sqrt(2) → d = (a - b) sqrt(2)/2.

But wait, wait. Wait, no: the equations are:

c + d = a
