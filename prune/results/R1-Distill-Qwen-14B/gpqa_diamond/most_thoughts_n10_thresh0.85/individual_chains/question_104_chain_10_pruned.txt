Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to break this down. Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets are similar in mass to Neptune, so their masses are about the same.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we see shifts in the spectral lines. So the maximum velocity of the star is what's measured here.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7. So the shift is larger for Planet #2. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( sin i ) / ( ( (P) ) ) ) ) ) ) 

Wait, but since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the orbits are circular (so e=0), the denominator's (1-e²)^0.5 becomes 1. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But maybe I can think in terms of the formula for the velocity of the star. The key point is that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ) assuming M_planet << M_star, which is true here since Neptune is much smaller than the Sun. So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( ( (M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) / (P^(1/3) )

But wait, since both planets have the same mass and the stars have the same mass, the ratio M_p/M_* is the same for both. So when comparing K1 and K2, since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Let's write the formula for K:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / P )

Wait, no, perhaps I should refer to the correct formula. I think the correct expression for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (21 * pi G )^(1/3) ) / (c^3) ) ] * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (P / (1 - e²) )^(-1/3) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so (1-e²)^0.5 is 1. And since M_* is much larger than M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( P^(1/3) ) ) ] * (v factor from the other terms)

Wait, maybe a better approach is to focus on the ratio. Since both M_p and M_* are the same for both systems, the ratio of K (velocity semi-amplitude) between planet 2 and planet 1 will depend on the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, wait, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/P) )^(1/3) ?

No, let me think again. The actual formula I recall is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (27 pi G ) / (2 c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

But for circular orbits (e=0), and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) / (2 c^3 )^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Since G and c are constants, the constants can be grouped, so K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

But in our case, M_p is the same for both planets (same mass as Neptune), and M_* is same for both stars (same as Sun). So (M_p / M_*) is same for both. Therefore, K1 and K2 are proportional to 1/P1^(1/3)
