Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. Using the radial velocity method, they detected shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift as the star moves due to the planet's orbit. The spectral line shift tells us about the star's velocity. So a larger shift would imply a higher velocity, right?

The formula I think I need here relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). The formula is something like K = (v) where v is the velocity, and it's related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the exact formula is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(P * 2π)) )^(1/1)... Hmm, maybe I should recall the precise relation. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) ) * (1/(P * (2π)^(1/3)) )) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the simplified version when M_planet is much smaller than M_star. Since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So the equation simplifies. I think the formula becomes K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/1) ) / (P * (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, another approach: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) where v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since the inclination i is the same for both planets (because we have detected the planets, so sin i is about 1 for both), and both M_planet are similar to Neptune, so M_planet is same for both. So the ratio of K1 and K2 would be [ (P2/P1) ]^(-1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Because K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ). Since M_planet and M_star are the same for both stars, the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3).

Wait, because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be longer than P1, since K and P are inversely related through this cube.

Wait, from the given data, the shift for planet 2 is 7 miliangstrom, which is larger than planet 1's 5. Since K is the velocity semi-amplitude, a larger K implies a higher velocity. So K2 = 7, K1=5. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the simplified formula, K ∝ (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_planet and M_star are same, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

Wait, so the ratio of P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, because if K2 > K1, then P2 > P1? Let me clarify.

If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P2/P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, let me write the relations for each planet.

For planet 1:
K1 = (constant) / (P1)^(1/3)

For planet 2:
K2 = (same constant) / (P2)^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, to find P2/P1, we cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^
