Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance to a star. The formula, I think, is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Bigger parallax means closer stars, and smaller parallax means they're farther away.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, I guess it's about how many stars you'd expect to find as you go to larger or smaller parallax values. Wait, but stars are distributed uniformly, so does that mean they're uniformly spread in distance? Or uniformly in some other measure?

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky doesn't necessarily mean uniform in distance. Because if you look at a uniform distribution in space, but you're observing from Earth, the number you see would depend on distance. But wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, so maybe it's uniform in terms of their actual spatial distribution in the universe, not their apparent distribution in the sky. Or perhaps it's more about the density of stars along our line of sight.

Wait, maybe I should approach this with some math. Let's consider the volume of space that a given parallax range would encompass.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance to that star is d
