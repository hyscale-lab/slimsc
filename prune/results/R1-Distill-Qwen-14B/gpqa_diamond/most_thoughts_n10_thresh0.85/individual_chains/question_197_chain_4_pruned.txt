Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I think I should start by analyzing these spectra to figure out what Compound X is.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm^-1, which usually suggests an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But since the other strong peak is at 1720 cm^-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) absorption. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an ester? Wait, but another peak at 1610 cm^-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. And 1450 cm^-1 might be another aromatic ring vibration, maybe the in-plane bending.

Looking at the 1H NMR now. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an O-H proton. So maybe a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like para-substituted aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. So if the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent, like a substituent in the para position. The 8.0 ppm is two protons, the 7.2 is another two, so it's probably a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or perhaps a single substituent that creates two doublets. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted group with an electron-withdrawing group. Like a nitro group? Or maybe a carbonyl, like a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group.

But wait, looking back at the IR: 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which is typically a carbonyl. So if the compound has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, but the O-H in NMR suggests maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits.

Wait, but when a carboxylic acid is
