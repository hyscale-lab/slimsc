Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

First, I remember that for crystals, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Wait, the formula... I think it's related to the reciprocal of d squared. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² = (l² + m² + n²)/(a²) + some terms involving the angles. 

Wait, no, that can't be right. I think it's the inverse of the square of the distance. Oh wait, I remember the general formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(k l cos α) )

But wait, that's only for a cubic system. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system or a special case. Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the general formula for any Bravais lattice.

Alternatively, I've heard about the interplanar distance formula in terms of the unit cell parameters. Oh right, for a general crystal, the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) planes is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (hk)(cos γ)/(a²) + (hl)(cos β)/(a²) + (kl)(cos α)/(a²)

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, this is a thought process, so I can't. Let me think. 

Another approach: For a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are of the same length 'a', and all the angles between the edges are equal, say α, β, γ. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in the unit cell? Or is it something else? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1, but for other structures, it might be different.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a crystal usually corresponds to the lattice parameter 'a'. So in
