Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I think "excited" here refers to the number of atoms in that energy level being higher. So the population of that energy level is higher in star_1. Oh right, because when atoms are more excited, they have higher energy states.

They also mention that the energy difference between the levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere is related to the temperature via the Boltzmann distribution. Since the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i is the population of the higher energy level, and n_j is the lower one. Wait, but in this case, which is the higher level? The problem says the energy difference is given, but the exact order isn't specified. Oh wait, the problem states that the energy difference was determined as 1.38e-23 J. Let me assume that the energy difference is E = 1.38e-23 J, so that would be the difference between the two levels, say E = E_upper - E_lower.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, that would mean that n_upper/n_lower is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 times (n2_upper / n2_lower). Because if the excitation is twice as much in star_1, then the ratio is higher.

So the ratio (n_upper /n_lower) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), right? Wait, actually, the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i is higher than E_j, then E_i - E_j is positive, and the exponential becomes less than 1, making n_i less than n_j. But wait, in this problem, n_upper is the higher energy level. So for a given star, the population ratio would be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower, which is positive. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, but in the problem, star_1 has a higher excitation, meaning a higher ratio. So n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Putting in the Boltzmann equation, that becomes:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the equations.

Let me denote R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(
