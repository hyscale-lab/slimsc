Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should look at the info given. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, the way the question is phrased is important. It says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 V mag with HIRES. Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. So, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars, right? Because the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17, right? Because brighter objects have lower magnitudes. So, if ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17, that's stars with apparent V mag ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, which is apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So what's the cutoff? If a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's less than 17. So, to be observable, the apparent V mag should be ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's apparent V mag ≤16.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The way it's written: for ESPRESSO, you can observe stars with V apparent mag brighter than 17. So if a star's V mag is 17 or fainter (i.e., higher number), can it be observed? No. Because fainter than 17 would be higher magnitude. So the observable stars for ESPRESSO have V mag ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16.

So each star's apparent V magnitude needs to be calculated, considering any extinction (dust reddening) if applicable. Because some stars might have E(B-V) given, which affects their apparent magnitude.

So the plan is: for each star, compute their apparent V magnitude.
