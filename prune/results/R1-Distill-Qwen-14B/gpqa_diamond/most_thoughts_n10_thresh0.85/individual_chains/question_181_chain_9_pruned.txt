Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-I, pp-II, pp-III branches. Wait, the question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping. So what happens when that happens?

Wait, pp-III is a part of the proton-proton chain, right? I think pp-III involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 ion. Oh right, in pp-III, two protons and a helium-3 nucleus combine to make a helium-4, releasing energy. And this process is one of the main sources of solar neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what neutrinos does that affect? I remember that the pp chain produces a lot of neutrinos via the beta plus decay. Wait, but wait, in the proton-proton chain, the main neutrinos are electron neutrinos, right? And the branching affects the production rate of these neutrinos.

Wait, so when the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would stop. So the total neutrino flux would decrease, but the question isn't about the total. It's about the ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

So I need to figure out how the neutrino flux in these bands changes when the pp-III process stops. But why would different energy bands be affected differently?

Hmm, perhaps the neutrinos emitted from different processes have different energies. For example, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos of a certain energy range. If that process stops, the flux in the lower or higher energy bands would drop more than others.

Wait, neutrinos from the pp-III branchâ€”I think that in the pp-III process, the neutrinos are lower energy compared to neutrinos from other processes like the CNO cycle. Oh, but wait, pp-III is part of the main pp chain. So the neutrinos from pp-III might be in the lower keV range.

Wait, I think that neutrinos from the pp chain are generally lower energy, in the 100s to 1000s of keV range. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, like a few MeV or so. So if the pp-III branch stops, the lower energy neutrinos will be less, but the high energy
