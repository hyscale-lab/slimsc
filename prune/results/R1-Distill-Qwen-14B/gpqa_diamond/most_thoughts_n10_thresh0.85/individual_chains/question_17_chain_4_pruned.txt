Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. We're told the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, wait, what do I remember about EDTA and formation constants? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions to form complexes. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (EDTA usually forms complexes with a 1:1 ratio), the formula would be something like CaY^2- or similar. But the exact formula might not matter for calculating the concentration.

Wait, the key here is the formation constant expression. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So K = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms because EDTA is a polyprotic acid. However, the problem states the pH is ideal. Oh, right, under ideal pH conditions, EDTA exists predominantly as the Y^4- form. So I don't have to worry about other protonated forms of EDTA. That's a relief because otherwise, the calculations would be more complicated.

So the formation constant K is 5e10 (5x10^10). The solution has the complex at 0.02 M. We want to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Wait, so the complex is at 0.02 M. Let me think about the equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote:

At equilibrium,

[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M (since it's stoichiometric
