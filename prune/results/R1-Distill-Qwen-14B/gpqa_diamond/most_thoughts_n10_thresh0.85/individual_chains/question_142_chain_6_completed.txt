Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is in the qubit space. The question gives me the density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit density matrix? A general qubit state can be written using the Bloch sphere formalism. The density matrix for a pure state is |ψ><ψ|, which corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. For mixed states, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, so the state would be inside the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the given rho, it's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh, wait, each of those terms is a projection operator. If I expand this, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and |1><1| is a matrix with 1 at (2,2) and 0 elsewhere. So adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 1/2. So rho is a diagonal matrix [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. That makes sense because the diagonal terms are equal, meaning there's equal probability for the qubit to be in state 0 or 1, and no coherence (the off-diagonal terms are zero). 

Now, how does this translate geometrically? The Bloch sphere representation uses a vector r = (x, y, z) where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix, the vector r is given by Tr(rho * σ), where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

Let me recall the formula: The Bloch vector components are x = <σ_x>, y = <σ_y>, z = <σ_z>. 

So let's compute each component.

The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The expectation value for σ_x is Tr(rho σ_x). So rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], so rho multiplied by σ_x is [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]]. Taking the trace: 0 + 0 = 0. So x=0.

Similarly, for σ_y: rho * σ_y gives [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]]. Trace is 0. So y=0.

For σ_z: rho * σ_z is [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]]. The trace is 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0. Wait, no! Wait, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So 1/2 (from (1,1)) and -1/2 (from (2,2)) adds up to 0. So z=0?

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the maximally mixed state is at the origin. Oh wait, because for a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). Because it's completely mixed, there's no preferred direction, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

So the vector is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, it becomes a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, where there is equal probability of the qubit being in state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\), and no coherence (off-diagonal terms are zero).

To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is derived from the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), where:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z).
\]

The Pauli matrices are:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

1. For \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x)\):  
   \[
   \rho \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = 0.
   \]

2. For \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y)\):  
   \[
   \rho \sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\frac{i}{2} \\ \frac{i}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = 0.
   \]

3. For \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z)\):  
   \[
   \rho \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = 0.
   \]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the qubit space. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is:
