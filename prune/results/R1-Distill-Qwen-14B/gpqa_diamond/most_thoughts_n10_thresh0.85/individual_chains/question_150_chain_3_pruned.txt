Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a final product after a series of reactions based on NMR data and reagents. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then there's a reaction sequence with three steps. My goal is to figure out what the final product is from the given options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Let me think about what each of these signals could correspond to.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO). Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet. That suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. Because J coupling would be with two protons, maybe a CH2-CHO group. So maybe the structure has a CH2-CHO somewhere.

The doublet at 6.98 ppm and another at 6.51 ppm, each integrating for 2H, likely correspond to aromatic protons. Since they are doublets, maybe they are part of para-substituted benzene rings. For example, in para-substituted benzene, each set of protons is a doublet if there's coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, no, in para substitution, the protons are usually a singlet because the two protons are equivalent and not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a case where the protons are in a meta position or perhaps part of a di-substituted ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of a conjugated diene or a coupling from an aromatic ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the doublets are from an aromatic ring where each set is adjacent to substituents. Let me think about the splitting. If a benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, the protons on adjacent carbons (ortho to substituents) would be coupled. But in para substitution, each substituent is opposite, so the protons on each substituent are in positions that are meta to each other. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where the substituents are in the ortho positions, making each set of protons a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diaryl compound, like two aryl groups attached to a central chain. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be the protons from each aryl group. For example, each aryl group could have two protons that are each a doublet because of coupling with adjacent protons on the same ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the other signals. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlets can be tricky; they could be from an -OH group, but wait, that's a singlet for 2H. Maybe it's an enol proton? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring with a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons on an aromatic ring that are part of an enol structure, hence the broadness due to possible exchange with something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 6.27 ppm could be a pair of protons that are in a conjugated system, maybe part of a conjugated diene. Or, considering the broadness, perhaps it's an -OH group, but that wouldn't account for 2H. Wait, maybe it's a pair of protons on a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl. Or maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen in some way.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests that these are likely CH2 groups. A doublet implies that these protons are next to another set of protons. For example, maybe it's a CH2 that's attached to another CH2 or perhaps an oxygen. Wait, 3.66 is upfield for a CH2 attached to oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2-O- structure. For instance, OCH2CH2, but the coupling would depend on the neighboring groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group (from the triplet at 9.72 ppm), two aromatic rings (from the two doublets in the aromatic region), and an oxygen-containing group like an ether or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could correspond to, say, two rings (each ring is one, so two rings would be two) and two double bonds (each is one), but wait, 2 rings and 1 double bond would be 3, but here it's 5. Hmm, perhaps a benzene ring (three degrees) and a double bond plus a ring? Wait, benzene is three (three double bonds), so the rest would account for two. Alternatively, maybe benzene plus a double bond and a ring elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the possible
