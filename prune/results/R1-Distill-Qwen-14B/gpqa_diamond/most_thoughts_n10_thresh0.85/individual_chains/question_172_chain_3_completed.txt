Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me read it again. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right! The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of energy levels changes with temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy states is equal to the exponential of (ΔE)/(k*T), but wait, actually it's the other way around. The population ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), because higher energy states are less populated if the temperature is lower.

So the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, N1 is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T1)), and for star_2, N2 is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T2)). So the ratio N1/N2 equals exp( (E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )? Wait, let me think.

Wait, actually, the ratio of the populations would be N1/N2 = exp( (E)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Because the energy difference is E = E2 - E1, but in the Boltzmann factor, it's E/kT for each state. Let's see, the higher energy level would have E higher, so for the ratio of higher level to lower, it's exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if the energy is higher in the excited state, then the ratio N_excited/N_ground is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, in the question, star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So N1_excited / N2_excited = 2. Let me think about the energy difference. The energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of the number in the excited state to the ground state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

So, N1/N2 (where N is the excited level) is 2, but wait, wait. Let me clarify. Star_1 has excited state population twice that of star_2. So N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited.

But the ratio of populations between two energy levels would be N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for each star, that ratio holds. Let me let N1 be the excited state population of star_1, N2 be that of star_2. Then N1/N2 = 2.

But for each star, N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so for star_1, N1 (excited) / N1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2, N2_excited / N2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, but we don't know the ground state populations of each star. Hmm. Unless we assume that the total number of atoms is the same? Or perhaps the ratio is such that the distribution within each star is considered between the same two states, so maybe the ratio of N1/N2 is given, but the ground states can be considered as the same proportion?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is between the same two states in each star. So, perhaps for each star, the ratio is N_excited / N_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But since the stars have different temperatures, their ratios are different.

Wait, but the problem states that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited. But I think that's not directly correct because the ground state populations could vary. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Wait, another approach. The Boltzmann factor for each star. The ratio of the excited to ground state is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, the ratio is (N1_excited)/(N1_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star_2, (N2_excited)/(N2_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

If I take the ratio of these two ratios, I get [N1/N1g] / [N2/N2g] = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

But I don't know the ground state populations. Unless the ground state populations are the same, so N1g = N2g. Or perhaps not, but perhaps the ratio of the excited states is given. So the problem says N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited.

Wait, that's the key. So N1_excited = 2 N2_excited.

But I don't know their ground state populations. So maybe I should take the ratio of the two excited states.

Wait, let me try writing the ratio of the two excited state populations.

N1_excited / N2_excited = 2.

But from Boltzmann, (N1_excited / N1_ground) / (N2_excited / N2_ground) ) = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So,

(N1/N2) * (N2g / N1g) ) = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, but I don't know N1g and N2g. Unless the ground state populations are the same for each star, perhaps because the same number of atoms are in the ground state. But that's an assumption I can't make unless stated. Alternatively, maybe the ground state population ratio is the same as the number of atoms in the star. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The ground state is just one state.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state and excited state are the only states considered, so for each star, the total number of iron atoms in those two states is N_ground + N_excited.

But that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the ratio of the excited states to each other, relative to their ground states.

Wait, let me think differently. The ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is given by:

excited/ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, that's r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, that could mean that (excited_1)/(excited_2) = 2. Or is it (excited_1)/(ground_1) = 2*(excited_2)/(ground_2)? Hmm, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". That wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that the fraction of excited atoms is higher, or the absolute number is higher?

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, maybe "twice as excited" refers to the population of that specific energy level. So N1 = 2 N2, where N1 is the number in the excited state of star_1 and N2 is the number in the same energy state in star_2.

But without knowing the total number of atoms, perhaps we can only consider the ratio of their populations relative to their ground states.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (N1_excited)/(N1_ground) = 2 * (N2_excited)/(N2_ground), but that's not necessarily correct. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's assume that the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, N1_excited = A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, N2_excited = A exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), where A is a proportionality constant that might relate to the total number of atoms or other factors.

Wait, the problem states that N1_excited = 2 N2_excited. So,

A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 A exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by A:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

[1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = (ln 2) * (k / ΔE )

But what's the value of k? The Boltzmann constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So let's compute (k / ΔE):

k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so k / ΔE = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

[1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2) * (1)

Which can be rewritten as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, let's see:

From our equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Then,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 -T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the equation we derived.

So the correct answer should be option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, star_1 and star_2, based on the observed population difference of iron atoms in a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the populations of energy levels to temperature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{N_{\text{excited}}}{N_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
   \]
   where \( N_{\text{excited}} \) and \( N_{\text{ground}} \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Population Ratio**: The problem states that the population of the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2:
   \[
   \frac{N_1^{\text{excited}}}{N_2^{\text{excited}}} = 2.
   \]
   Using the Boltzmann factor for each star:
   \[
   \frac{N_1^{\text{excited}}}{N_1^{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{N_2^{\text{excited}}}{N_2^{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
   \]
   Taking the ratio of these two expressions:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{N_1^{\text{excited}}}{N_1^{\text{ground}}}}{\frac{N_2^{\text{excited}}}{N_2^{\text{ground}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{N_1^{\text{excited}}}{N_2^{\text{excited}}} = 2 \), we get:
   \[
   \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
   \]

3. **Simplifying**: Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E}.
   \]
   Substituting \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) and \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
   \]

4. **Final Equation**: Rearranging further:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]
   This matches the form of option D.

### Conclusion:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
