Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it through carefully.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate both pH values to match them with the options.

First, let me parse the problem. We've got 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 L. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and also at the equivalence point.

I think I should start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution, then find out how much NaOH is needed for 25% titration and the equivalence point, and then calculate the pH in each case.

So, step 1: Dilution calculation.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be:

M1V1 = M2V2

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L, V2 is 0.04 L.

So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait—actually, when you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, you're not changing its molarity in a straightforward way because it's a weak acid and doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, no—dilution affects the concentration of the undissociated acid. Wait, perhaps the initial concentration is 0.025 M, yes. Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration is halved. Oh wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, so moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³—so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So yes, diluted to 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to acetate ions. But before that, at 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

So, let's find the volume of NaOH needed for 25% titration and for equivalence.

First, calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So, for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is (moles)/concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

Wait, but the problem says "25% titration"—so that's 25% of the acetic acid neutralized. So the moles of NaOH used would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

So the
