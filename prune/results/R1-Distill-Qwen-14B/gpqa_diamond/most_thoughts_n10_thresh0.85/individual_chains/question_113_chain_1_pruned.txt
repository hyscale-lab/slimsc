Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what information I have.

The question says that an unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine its chemical formula from the given options.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, maybe the compound has an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group? But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a very strong and broad peak. Alternatively, an alcohol (like -OH) could also cause a broad peak. But then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those regions typically correspond to carbonyl groups. 1700 is often a C=O stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an amide or perhaps conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated ester or something else. But wait, two carbonyl groups? That would mean the compound has two such groups. Hmm, wait, but let me thinkâ€”I might be mixing things up. Another possibility is that the 1650 peak is something else. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in a C=C stretch) or an amine? Or perhaps an acid derivative.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in a CH2=CH group. So the molecule has a double bond. So that might explain the IR peak at 1650. Wait, the 1650 cm^-1 is usually around where conjugated carbonyls or aromatic C=C stretches are. So if there's a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, then we would have both the C=O (around 1700) and the conjugated C=C (maybe around 1650) in the same structure. That could explain both peaks. So maybe it's a compound with a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So for the IR, the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. But wait, if it's a carbonyl group and an O-H, that could fit with something like a beta-keto alcohol or perhaps a hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad O-H stretch, but then the IR would also show a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1 for the C=O. But if the compound has two carbonyl groups, the formula would need two oxygen atoms for each carbonyl. Wait, but the options have different numbers of oxygen atoms. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the possible oxygen counts are 0, 1, 2. The IR suggests at least two oxygen-containing groups, perhaps. Wait, but the O-H is one oxygen, and two carbonyls would require two more. But that's four oxygens. Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyl groups is a ketone, and the other is an ester or something else.

Wait, but the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggests two different carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system that's causing both peaks. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Like an enone (conjugated ketone and double bond). In that case, there's only one carbonyl group, but the conjugated double bond would absorb at around 1650. So that would explain the 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C) peaks. But then where does the broad peak at 3000 come from? That would be the O-H group, perhaps an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

So putting that together: the compound has a carbonyl group (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650). It also has an O-H group (broad peak). So the formula would have at least two oxygen atoms: one for the carbonyl (C=O) and another for the O-H group. So that would mean O2. Looking at the options, that's either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, looking at the NMR: it shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there are hydrogens attached to a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond, which is conjugated perhaps to the carbonyl.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. 45 is a common mass, like for (CH3)2O (which is 45 for trimethylamine, but more likely, perhaps the fragment is an ethyl group or something else). Wait, wait, wait. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, but that's 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24+6+16=46? Wait, no, (CH3)2O would be 2*(15) + 16 = 30 +16=46. Oh wait, maybe the fragment is like CH3COH (if it's an ethylene glycol fragment?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, but that's not right). Alternatively, maybe it's an acetyl group, but that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, if the molecule has a double bond and a ring, that's two degrees of unsaturation
