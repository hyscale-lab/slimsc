Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. 

So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. They also mention that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are found in that interval, which probably means that the wave function is zero outside that region. 

Wait, no, actually, in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So if no particles are found outside x=1 to x=3, that means the probability density (which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function) must be zero outside that interval. So the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. Therefore, the wave function only exists between x=1 and x=3. 

But looking at the given wave function: (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Hmm. Wait, that's an interesting expression. Let me parse that. So the wave function is a complex function because it has an 'i' term. The square of the absolute value of the wave function would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. 

So let's compute the absolute square. For a wave function ψ = A + iB, the absolute square is (A^2 + B^2). 

In this case, ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)². 

But wait, the probability density must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But for x <1, the region from -infinity to 1, and for x>3, the region from 3 to infinity. So when x is less than 1, the wave function must be zero. Similarly for x>3. 

But wait, how can that be? The given wave function doesn't have any exponential terms or anything that would make it zero outside a certain interval. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is only defined in the region where x is between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside that interval. But the way the problem is phrased, the wave function is given as that expression in the region where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside that, ψ is zero. 

But wait, in the given wave function, for x values in 1 to 3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

Now, since the wave function must be normalizable, the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 should be 1. 

Let me write down the probability density. 

|ψ|^2 = [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 ] + [ (-0.5)^2 ] 
= (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral. 

Breaking it down into two parts: 

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: 
a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. 

So that would be a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4)=2 ln(2), and ln(4)-ln(2)=ln(2). 

The second integral is the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). 

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931. 

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. 

Wait, 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.72. So a is the square root of that. 

sqrt(0.72) is approximately 0.8485. Let me check: 0.8485 squared is about 0.72. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) 0.85. 

But wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the integral calculation. 

The first part: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² [ ln(1+x) ] from 1 to3. 

At x=3: ln(4). At x=1: ln(2). So difference is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2) as I said. 

Second part: 0.25*(3-1)=0.5. 

So sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²= 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈0.72. So a≈√0.72≈0.8485. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the correct choice. 

Wait, but another thought: is the wave function correctly given? The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. The real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a complex function with a constant imaginary part. 

Wait a second, but if the imaginary part is a constant, that might complicate things. Because usually, wave functions are either real or have some specific form, but this has a constant imaginary part. So let's think, is that acceptable? 

In quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex. So that's fine. But the integral of |ψ|^2 is the sum of the squares of real and imaginary parts. So that's correct. 

Another thing to check: normalization. So with a≈0.85, the integral would give 1. Let me compute again with a=0.85. 

a²= 0.7225. 

So a² ln(2)= 0.7225 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.7225 *0.6931 ≈ approximately 0.5. 

Because 0.7225 *0.6931 ≈ 0.5. Let me compute: 0.7225 *0.6931. 

0.7 *0.6931=0.48517. 0.0225 *0.6931≈0.01559. So sum is approx 0.48517 +0.01559= 0.50076. 

Adding the other part (0.5) gives 0.50076 +0.5=1.00076. Which is approximately 1. So that's correct. 

So the value of a is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer is option B. 

I think I've gone through this correctly. The steps are: compute the probability density, set up the integral, solve for a, and check the options.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics. The total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(2). \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5. \)

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is \( a = 0.85 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
