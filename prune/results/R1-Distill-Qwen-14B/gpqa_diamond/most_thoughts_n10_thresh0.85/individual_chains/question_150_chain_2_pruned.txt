Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, I need to figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data, and then determine what happens when it's treated with the given reagents. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. 

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Breaking down the NMR:

- The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with 1H. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, could it be something else? Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenol, but phenols are usually broader and maybe downfield. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde adjacent to a double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, the aldehyde proton can be around 9-10 ppm and split into a triplet because of coupling with two protons on the adjacent carbon. Hmm, so maybe that's the case here.

- Then, the 6.98 ppm doublet (d) with 2H. That seems like para-substituted aromatic protons. Like in a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. So maybe two sets of aromatic rings.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) also suggests aromatic protons, perhaps in a different substitution pattern. Wait, but if the ring is para-substituted, each set of two protons would be a doublet. So perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings are attached to the molecule.

- The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs) with 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an enol proton, or something with exchange, like an -OH group, but it's 2H. Wait, but if it's adjacent to oxygen, maybe it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group (CH2) that's next to an electronegative atom, but I'm not so sure.

- The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a CH2 group connected to something deshielded. Maybe an OCH2 group, since oxygen typically deshields nearby protons. So perhaps an OCH2CH2 group, but wait, the splitting is a doublet, which suggests each proton is next to one other equivalent proton. So maybe an -OCH2- group in a structure like a diethyl ether or something else.

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aldehyde group, two benzene rings (each para-substituted), an OCH2 group, and maybe some conjugation.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees. That could be a ring (benzene) which is three double bonds, so that's three, then maybe another double bond and a ring. Or perhaps a benzene ring (3) and a double bond (1) and a ring (1). Wait, no, a ring is one degree. So 3 from benzene, one from another ring (like a cyclohexane), and one from a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's two benzene rings (each contributing 3, but wait, C8H9NO... That's a bit tricky. Wait, another approach: the formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: benzene rings would account for 6 carbons, so with two benzene rings, that's 12 C, but we have only 8, so that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the molecule has one benzene ring (6 C) and two other substituents. Or maybe the structure isn't two benzene rings.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is a substituted phenyl group. Let me think. The aldehyde at 9.72, perhaps. So an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. Then, the OCH2 group. Maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, but looking at the options given, all the options have but-enal or but-anal groups. So perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent.

Let me think about the reagents. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is typically used for diazotization. So the starting compound must have an
