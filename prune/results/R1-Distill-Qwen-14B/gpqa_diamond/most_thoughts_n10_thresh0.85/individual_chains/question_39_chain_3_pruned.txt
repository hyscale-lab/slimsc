Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle and finding the normalization constant 'a'. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) minus 0.5i. Wait, wait, but I remember that wave functions need to be normalized. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

Wait, but the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that region. Oh, wait no, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but perhaps that's only between x=1 and x=3. Because when they measured, particles were only found there. So maybe the wave function is zero outside, but the given expression is valid between 1 and 3.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. The problem states that when measuring, none were found at x <1 or x>3, so the wave function must be zero outside that region. So the actual wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x) ) - 0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function ψ(x) is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but wait, the given expression is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So is that the entire wave function for x in [1,3], or is that just part of it? Hmm. Oh, because the problem says the wave function in the part of space where it can exist. So, yes, between x=1 and x=3, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Elsewhere, it's zero.

So to normalize this, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, and set that equal to 1.

Calculating |ψ(x)|² would be ψ*(x) * ψ(x). ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying these together: 

[(a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] 

= (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 - [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i - (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i ] 

Wait, wait, when you multiply (c + di)(c - di) = c² + d². Because the cross terms are imaginary and cancel out. 

So yes, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

So the integral becomes the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx. 

And that should equal 1.

So the integral is [a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 ] + [0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3 ] = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second part: 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, because the integral is a² * [ln(2)] + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Wait, wait, no: 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is around 0.7213, right? Because 0.6931 * 0.72 = approximately 0.5.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, which means a is the square root of that. Let's compute sqrt(0.7213).

sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait: let me check the calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, wait a minute. The wave function is a complex function. So when I compute |ψ|^2, it's (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts cancel out when you multiply (c+di)(c-di)=c² + d².

So yes, the integral becomes ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

So the integral is a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus 0.25*2.
