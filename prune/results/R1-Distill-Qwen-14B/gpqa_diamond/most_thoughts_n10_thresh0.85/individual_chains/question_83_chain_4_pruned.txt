Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I think I can work through each part.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should proceed until all the acid is neutralized. Let me think about the initial dilution first.

When we mix equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration should change. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Since volume is in cm³, which is the same as mL, I can calculate it as moles = M * V (in liters). Wait, no—acetic acid is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. So moles = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So yes, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point first because that's one of the questions. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. So adding 10 cm³ of NaOH would reach the equivalence point? Because 40 + 10 is 50 cm³ total, but for the equivalence point, it's just about the moles, not the total volume.

So, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). Acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH from there.

The total volume at equivalence is initial 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid
