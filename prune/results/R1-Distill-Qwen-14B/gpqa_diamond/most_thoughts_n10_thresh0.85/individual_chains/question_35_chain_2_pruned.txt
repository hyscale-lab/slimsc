Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? So, Ay = c * S. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, I think that's the Pauli Y matrix but maybe scaled or something.

Wait, Pauli matrices are usually like σx, σy, σz. The standard sigma y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So S here is just the sigma y matrix. So Ay is c multiplied by sigma y. Since c is h/(4π), let me write that down. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, from the options, pick which statement is correct.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

Wait, let me write out the matrix Ay. Let's compute it:

Ay = [ [ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ],
        [ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ] ]

So Ay is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the equation (Ay - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So,

[ [ -a, -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i i) (h²/(4π)^2) ]

Wait, compute the second term. Let's compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So:

determinant = a² - (1) * (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * sqrt(1), which is ± h/(4π) * 1. Wait, sqrt(1) is 1, so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right?

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention h/(4π) as a real part or anything. Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues I found are purely real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it's stating imaginary parts as ±2πh, which are non-zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't seem to match what I found either. Because I found the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.

In quantum mechanics, if two operators commute, they can share eigenfunctions. The square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with each component, I think. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct. Now about Az: Ay and Az do not commute, because angular momentum components don't commute. So their eigenfunctions are different. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, basis functions usually refer to the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors will form a basis for R² (or C², since it's a spin-½ system). So D's statement seems correct. Wait, but what's the exact wording? It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator is represented in terms of these basis functions, so I think D is correct as well.

Wait, but
