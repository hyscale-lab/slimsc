Okay, I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question presents four matrices W, X, Y, Z. I need to look at each option and determine which statement is correct.

Let me start by recalling some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, also known as the time evolution operator, must be unitary. For a matrix to be unitary, its conjugate transpose multiplied by itself should equal the identity matrix (UU† = I). Also, the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary, as the evolution operator often comes from e^(-iHt), where H is Hermitian.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.
Hmm. So this is about whether e^X is unitary. If e^X isn't unitary, then multiplying a vector by it could change the vector's norm. Wait, for a unitary matrix U, UU†=I, so ||Uv|| = ||v||. If e^X is not unitary, then the norm could change.

So I need to check if X is skew-Hermitian because e^(iX) would be unitary if X is skew-Hermitian. Wait, let me think—skew-Hermitian means X† = -X. So for X to be skew-Hermitian, the (i,j) element should be the negative complex conjugate of the (j,i) element.

Looking at X:
First row: i, -1, 2i
Second: 1, 0, 1
Third: 2i, -1, -i

Let me compute X†, which is the conjugate transpose.

Conjugate of X:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now transpose X† to get (X†):
First column becomes first row: -i, -1, -2i
Second column: -1, 0, 1
Third column: -2i, -1, i

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the conjugate of X is:

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate each element:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose it, which would swap rows and columns.

So X† would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute X† properly.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Transposing X:
The columns become rows. So, the first column is [i,1,2i], so the first row becomes [i,1,2i].

Wait, but X† is the conjugate transpose. So first, take the transpose, then take the complex conjugate.

Wait, no. X† is the conjugate transpose. So first, transpose the matrix, then take the complex conjugate of each element.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around: transpose and then conjugate each element. So, first, transpose, then take the complex conjugate of each entry.

Wait, no—conjugate transpose is when you take the transpose and then complex conjugate each element
