Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a moving glass. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, it's all about how the medium's motion affects the light's speed. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here. Let me think.

So, the speed of light in a medium, like glass, is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So this is a case where we have to consider the motion of the medium.

I think this is where the concept of relativistic addition of velocities comes into play. Because the glass is moving, the observer would see the light's speed differently. Wait, but isn't the speed of light always c in a vacuum regardless of the source's motion? Oh wait, but this is inside a medium, so maybe it's different. Or is it?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But if the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light in that medium?

Hmm. I remember there's something about the Doppler effect for light, but that's more about frequency and wavelength changes. Maybe this isn't directly applicable here, but perhaps it's related.

Alternatively, I've heard of the concept of the velocity transformation in special relativity. The velocity addition formula says that if an object is moving at velocity u in a frame moving at velocity v, then the observed velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's for objects moving at significant fractions of c. But light is moving at c in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's moving slower. So maybe the formula applies here but adjusted for the medium's speed.

Wait, but the problem states that the light is in the glass, so its speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving with velocity v. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, I think I should model the situation
