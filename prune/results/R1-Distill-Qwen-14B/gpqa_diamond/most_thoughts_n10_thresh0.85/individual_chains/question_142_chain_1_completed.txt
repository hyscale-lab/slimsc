Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. So, what's this particular matrix look like?

I think |0> and |1> are the standard basis states in a two-level system, like a qubit. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding those two gives a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5.

Wait, but the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I remember something called the Bloch sphere for qubit states. The Bloch sphere represents pure states of a qubit as points on the surface of a unit sphere. But ρ here isn't a pure state; it's a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0> and |1>. Oh, right, the density matrix for a pure state would have rank 1, but this one has rank 2 because both diagonal elements are non-zero. So it's a mixed state.

Wait, how does a mixed state appear in the Bloch sphere representation? I think for a mixed state, the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, with the distance from the origin representing the purity of the state. The completely mixed state (like this one) should be at the center, right?

The completely mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. That's exactly what ρ is here: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 = I/2. So this is the maximally mixed state, which has zero purity. Its representation on the Bloch sphere would be at the origin. But wait, how does that translate to coordinates?

The Bloch sphere is parameterized using angles θ and φ, but for the density matrix, the representation in terms of the Bloch vector would be r=(x,y,z). I think the relation between the density matrix and the Bloch vector is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let's write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So ρ = (I + x σx + y σy + z σz ) / 2. For ρ to be (I/2), that means x, y, z must all be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0), which is the origin. Therefore, the geometrical position is at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's the same as (I)/2, which is the completely mixed state. So yes, it's at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0). So option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(0.5\), making it a completely mixed state. The density matrix of a pure state has rank 1, but this state has rank 2, confirming it is mixed. 

For a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) using the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state being at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**: Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid qubit state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
