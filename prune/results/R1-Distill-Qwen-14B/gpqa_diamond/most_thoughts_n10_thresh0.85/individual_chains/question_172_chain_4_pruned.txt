Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles across energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states. Oh right, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). 

Wait, the problem is about the excitation of iron atoms. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or another state. Let me see. In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote this as delta E. 

So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me think: if we're comparing the same energy levels in each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state would be different for each star because their temperatures are different. 

Wait, more precisely, the excitation level is the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. So for star_1, n1_excited / n1_lower = 2 times (n2_excited / n2_lower). Or wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps n1 / n_ground1 = 2 * (n2 / n_ground2). Not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio for each star would be: 

For star 1: (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = (g_upper1/g_lower1) * exp(-deltaE/(k*T1))
For star 2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = (g_upper2/g_lower2) * exp(-deltaE/(k*T2))

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars since it's the same element (iron), so (g_upper/g_lower) is same for both. Let's call that factor 'g' which cancels out when taking the ratio.

So, (n_upper1/n_lower1)/(n_upper2/n_lower2) )= [ exp(-deltaE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-deltaE/(k T2)) ] = exp( deltaE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that exponent. 

- deltaE/(k T1) + deltaE/(k T2) 

Wait, no: the exponents are subtracted. So when you take the ratio, the exponents subtract. So:

exp( [ -deltaE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -deltaE/(k T2) ] ) equals exp( [ deltaE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ] )

But wait, [ exp(a) ] / [ exp(b) ] = exp(a - b), so yeah. 

So the ratio is exp( deltaE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

And from the problem, this ratio is equal to 2, because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, I need to be precise: the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Hmm, so the excitation is twice as much. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

So (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2)

Which implies that the ratio of the two ratios is 2. 

So (ratio1)/(ratio2) = exp( deltaE/k (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The ratio for star 1 is ratio1 = (n_upper1/n_lower1) = (g) exp( -deltaE/(k T1) )

The ratio for star 2 is ratio2 = (n_upper2/n_lower2) )= (g) exp( -deltaE/(k T2) )

So the ratio ratio1 / ratio2 is [ exp(-deltaE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) ] = exp[ deltaE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

And this ratio is given to be 2, because the excitation is twice as high in star_1.

So 2 = exp( deltaE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = deltaE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation.

Wait, deltaE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, is that the same as k (Boltzmann constant)? Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So deltaE = k.

Wait, deltaE = 1.38e-23 J is equal to k, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So deltaE = k.

So substituting deltaE = k:

ln(2) = k/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1
