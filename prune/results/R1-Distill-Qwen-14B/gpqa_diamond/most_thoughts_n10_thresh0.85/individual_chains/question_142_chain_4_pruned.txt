Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. So the question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Each term here is a projector onto the |0> and |1> states. So each of those projectors is a diagonal matrix with a 1 in the corresponding position and 0 elsewhere. Let me write them out.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

I think this is a maximally mixed state. Maximally mixed states are the classical states with maximum entropy. For a qubit, the maximally mixed state has equal probabilities for both |0> and |1>, which aligns with this matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this part. I remember that qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has a basis for pure states, but density matrices are more general. For density matrices, the state is represented as a point in a space, perhaps the 3D space of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is a 3-dimensional vector (rx, ry, rz). The vector r determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere, with the magnitude of r being ≤ 1 because of the trace condition.

So let's expand this. The given ρ is (I)/2. That would mean that when I expand it as (I + r·σ)/2, the r·σ term must be zero. Because ρ = I/2 = (I + 0 ) / 2. So r·σ = 0, which implies that r must be the zero vector (0,0,0).

What's the implication of that? The zero vector in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, the density matrix is I/2, which is maximally mixed. So any pure state would have |r| = 1, and mixed states would have |r| less than 1. In this case, |r|=0, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix being (I)/2 implies that r is zero. So the geometrical position is at the origin in the
