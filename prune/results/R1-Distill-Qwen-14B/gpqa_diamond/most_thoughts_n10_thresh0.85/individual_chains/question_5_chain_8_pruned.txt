Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, which means its direction can be represented with angles maybe like theta from the z-axis and phi around the z-axis, I think. But wait, the problem says it's in the x-z plane, so phi is probably 0 or 90 degrees? No, wait, any direction in the x-z plane would have phi=0 or pi/2? Or maybe not, because phi is the azimuthal angle in spherical coordinates. Oh right, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the angle phi would be 0 or pi, I think. Because in spherical coordinates, phi is the angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi must be zero or pi. Hmm, but maybe that's not critical right now.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The question is to find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in a direction n is given by P = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). So the operator we're considering is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So P simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, I should write down the components. Let me see:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]].
Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Let's say n makes an angle theta with the z-axis. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with an angle theta from the z-axis, but perhaps it's better to express n in terms of spherical coordinates. Wait, for a direction in the x-z plane, the polar angle theta would be measured from the positive z-axis, and the azimuthal angle phi would be zero (since it's in the x-z plane, which is like the 'x' being the first axis and 'z' the third). So phi = 0, theta is the angle from z. So n_x = sin(theta) * cos(phi) = sin(theta), since phi=0. n_z = cos(theta).

So n_x
