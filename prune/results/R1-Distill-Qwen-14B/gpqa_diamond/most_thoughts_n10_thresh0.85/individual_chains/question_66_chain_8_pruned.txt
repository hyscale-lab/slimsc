Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you parameterize the effects. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, CPT symmetry. And the choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I think Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Because SMEFT is a field theory, it's supposed to be relativistic. So all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if the theory has a well-defined energy-momentum, Poincare should be respected. But wait, SMEFT is valid below a certain scale, the new physics scale. Operators are organized by their dimension, and each operator has a coefficient that's dimension-dependent. Do these operators preserve Poincare symmetry? I think yes, because the way SMEFT is constructed, the interactions are local, so they should respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincare.

Wait, but sometimes you might have operators that break Lorentz symmetry. Oh, but in SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry. Because if you have to construct higher-dimensional operators, they have to fit into the Lorentz structure of the SM. So all operators must respect Lorentz, which would imply they also respect Poincare because Poincare includes Lorentz and translation. Or wait, no, because Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So if operators don't respect Poincare, maybe they don't have to? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should be governed by the same symmetries as the Standard Model, but perhaps not beyond that. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must too. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, the other options are CP and CPT. I think the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, but that's because certain terms violate it. But wait, do the operators in SMEFT have to respect CP symmetry? Or can they violate it if the new physics does?

Wait, SMEFT allows for all possible higher-dimensional operators that preserve the symmetries of the SM. But not all SM operators necessarily respect CP. For example, the SM includes CP-violating phases, like in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP as well, as long as they are constructed in a way that fits the SM's symmetry structure.

So C) says 1,2,4. Wait, CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The SM respects CPT symmetry, I think. So if the SM respects CPT, then SMEFT, which is an effective theory of the SM, must also respect CPT. Because any term that violates CPT would not be part of the SM, and SMEFT is supposed to be a valid expansion of the SM.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any operator in SMEFT breaks CPT, that would be a problem. But I think that in SMEFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry because that's part of the SM's symmetry. Because if you have a term that violates CPT, it's not part of the SM, and SMEFT is built from SM fields. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily respected. Because the SM already includes CP violation, so SMEFT operators can have terms that involve CP violation. So 3 is not a must.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, wait, but wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations, which would imply momentum conservation. But in SMEFT, you have higher-dimension operators. Do they all have to be local, hence respecting translation symmetry?

Yes, because SMEFT is a local effective field theory. So all the terms are local, so they must respect translation symmetry, which is part of Poincare. So 2 is correct.

So putting it all together, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be correct.

Wait, another way to think: Poincare is a subset of which symmetries? Or is it a separate one. Because Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if Poincare is a requirement, then Lorentz is as well. But the options have the two as separate, so perhaps the question is testing whether both are required.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is asking which symmetries must be respected, so if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is automatically a must. But the options have 1 and 2 as separate options.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But in the question, the first option is 1 (Lorentz) and second is 2 (Poincare). So if 2 is correct, then 1 must also be correct. So can the answer include 1 and 2 as correct?

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,
