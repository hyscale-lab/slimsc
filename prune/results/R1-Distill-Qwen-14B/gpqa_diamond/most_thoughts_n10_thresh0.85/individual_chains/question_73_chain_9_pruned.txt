Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic... so I'm thinking I should use the theory of relativity here, probably special relativity.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they are moving in the same direction. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially at high speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract the speeds directly like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity comes into play here.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the values. Wait, wait, actually, the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between the two, but using the relativistic formula.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The relative speed u' of object 2 from the frame of object 1 would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2*v1)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula for u relative to u’ is (u’ - u)/(1 - (u’u)/c²). Hmm, I might get confused here. Let me think: when you have two frames moving at velocities u and u’ relative to each other, the speed of an object in one frame as seen from the other is given by (u’ - u)/(1 - (u’u)/(c²)).

Oh right, so in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Hmm, negative, but speed is a magnitude, so maybe the absolute value is taken? Or perhaps I should have taken the other way around, so the relative speed of A as seen from B? So maybe I should compute (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). That gives 0.1c/(1 - 0.3c²/c²) = 0.1c/(0.7) ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Oh, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Wait, wait, but each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy. So the total energy should be the sum of each individual's energy.

So each astronaut's energy is given by gamma multiplied by mc². But wait, their rest mass is not m but 2m and 3m, right? So for astronaut A (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

Gamma for A: 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A: gamma * mass * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0
