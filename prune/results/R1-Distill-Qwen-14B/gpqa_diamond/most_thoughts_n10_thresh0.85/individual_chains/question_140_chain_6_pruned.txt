Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with a liquid Y, releasing a gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. That's just a bit above room temperature, so B must be a solid under normal conditions.

The question also mentions that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is probably an element that has isotopes, or maybe a compound where one element is an isotope. Wait, but the way it's phrased, X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has an isotope that's heavier than the standard one. For example, maybe X is a diatomic molecule like H2, but one of the H's is deuterium, making it HD or D2? Because deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen.

Looking at the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions could be things like metals reacting with acids, or maybe something like a decomposition reaction. The release of gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen. Wait, but if it's a molecule, like maybe NH3? No, wait. Wait, the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about the possible elements. Let's say the gas is something like CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 6 neutrons (since carbon has 6 protons and, in CH4, each H is 1 neutron? Wait, no, perhaps the gas is something else.

Wait, the gas's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think: maybe CO2? No, that's 22 protons (carbon 6, oxygen 8 each). Wait, maybe it's something like O2? No, O2 has 16 protons each, so 32 in total. But for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen has atomic number 8, common isotope is 16O with 8 neutrons). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. But wait, O2 would have 16 protons each, so 32 total protons. Neutrons: each O has 8, so 16 total. So 32 protons and 16 neutrons? No, that's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is something with a single atom? Like, maybe He? No, because He is monoatomic. But the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So if it's a monoatomic gas, then the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the atom. So which elements have that?

For example, carbon-12 (but that's 6 protons, 6 neutrons). So
