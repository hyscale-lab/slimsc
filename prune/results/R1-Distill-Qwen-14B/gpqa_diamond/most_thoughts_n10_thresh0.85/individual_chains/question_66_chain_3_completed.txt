Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries, and the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me start by recalling what SMEFT is. SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model (SM) by including all possible higher-dimensional operators suppressed by some high energy scale. These operators are organized by their dimension, with the SM being the renormalizable part (dimension 4) and the higher-dimension operators (like dimension 5,6, etc.) being the additions in SMEFT.

Now, symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the Lagrangian. The SM respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, should maintain these symmetries as well because they are part of the underlying theory.

So, which symmetries are these? Let's go through each option:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SM is Lorentz invariant, meaning it respects the principles of special relativity. SMEFT, being an effective theory that includes the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz scalars or, if they involve spinors, they should transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So 1 is a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM's Lagrangian is translationally invariant, meaning it looks the same everywhere (homogeneity of space and time), and it respects momentum conservation. Since SMEFT extends the SM, it must also respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also a must.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincare includes both Lorentz and translational symmetries. So if Lorentz is required, does that mean Poincare is automatically required? Or is Poincare a separate symmetry? I think Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well, which includes Lorentz invariance and translation invariance. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, must also be respected.

Wait, but I thought that in the SMEFT formalism, the operators are classified as being consistent with the symmetries of the SM. The SM includes Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must also respect that. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

3. CP symmetry: The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. In fact, CP violation is observed in the weak interactions. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. For example, the SM itself has terms that break CP (like the CKM matrix in QCD), so the effective theory can include operators that break CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM is CPT symmetric. CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). In the SM, all interactions are CPT symmetric. So any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. This is because all the terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian are built from the SM fields and interactions, which are CPT invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must be CPT symmetric. So 4 is a must.

Putting it all together: The operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. They don't necessarily have to respect CP (3), since the SM already allows for CP violation.

Wait, but wait another thing. Poincare symmetry implies Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. So if all operators respect Poincare (2), then they automatically respect Lorentz (1). So the question is whether both 1 and 2 are required, or just 2. Because if 2 is required, then 1 is automatically included. But the question presents them as separate options. So the question is whether both 1 and 2 are correct.

So the options are:

The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a symmetry, then Lorentz is included. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, but wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry. So all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So 2 must be correct, and 1 is automatically correct. But the question lists 1 and 2 as separate options. So in the options, the correct answer would include both 1 and 2.

Looking at the choices:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. Option C includes all three: 1,2,4. So since SMEFT must respect Poincare, Lorentz, and CPT, the correct answer would include 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let's double-check. CPT symmetry is required. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, as SMEFT is built upon it. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which is a fundamental symmetry of special relativity. Since SMEFT extends the SM, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, Lorentz symmetry (1) is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. The SM is Poincaré invariant, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must also respect this symmetry. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry (2) is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in weak interactions. Since SMEFT can include operators that break CP, CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT symmetric, and this symmetry is preserved in SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4).

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required. Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 1,2,4**.

Answer: C
