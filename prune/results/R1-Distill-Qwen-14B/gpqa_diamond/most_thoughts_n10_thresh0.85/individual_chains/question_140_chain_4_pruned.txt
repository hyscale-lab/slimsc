Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, producing a gas W, a precipitate G, and another substance B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has an isotope with a heavier element.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let's start by trying to figure out what substance X is. The clue about the heavier isotope suggests it might be something like deuterium, but wait, that's an isotope of hydrogen. Or maybe it's something else. Wait, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons.

Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has one proton and one neutron? Wait, no. Wait, H2 is just two H atoms, each with one proton and zero neutrons. So that's not equal. What about another gas?

Wait, another possibility: the gas with equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Let's calculate. Let's say the molecule has a charge of 0. Let me think of possible elements. Maybe CO2? No, that's a molecule. Wait, but CO2 has 22 neutrons? Wait, no, each carbon has 6 neutrons normally, but there are isotopes. Wait, that might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is water vapor? No, because H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the total for each molecule would be 2+8=10 protons and (0*2) +8=8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, what about CH4? No, that's a molecule, but each CH4 has 6 protons (C) and 4 H, so 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has none. So 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, another thought: maybe W is NH3? No. Let me think elements with equal protons and neutrons. For example, O has 8 protons, and if it's O-16, it has 8 neutrons. So O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. But O as a molecule is O2 or O3. Wait, O2 has two O atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that's equal. So W could be O2? Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number.

Alternatively, another element where the number of protons equals neutrons. Let's see, for example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So if W is C, but as a molecule, that's an atom, not a molecule. Hmm.

Wait
