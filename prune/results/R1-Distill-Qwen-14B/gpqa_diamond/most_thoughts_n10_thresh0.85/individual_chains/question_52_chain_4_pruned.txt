Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels — level 1 and level 2. They say this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Å, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) in the photosphere.

Hmm. I remember that in LTE, the populations of different energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (let's say level 2 and level 1) is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)).

Wait, but wait: the problem says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio n1/n2 goes down, that means n2/n1 goes up. Because n1/n2 is reciprocal of n2/n1.

Wait, let's read that again. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels, level 1 and level 2. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. Which is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. So that's the factor by which the ratio increases when the star doesn't have spots.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots." So the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots is the factor. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But wait, what affects this ratio? It depends on the temperature because the Boltzmann factor involves T. So when the overall temperature of the photosphere decreases due to spots, what happens to the ratio?

The transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a certain wavelength of 1448 Å. Wait, so that must be the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of that wavelength. So the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/λ. Since λ is given, we can calculate E.

But maybe I don't need the exact energy value. Let's see. The key point is that the ratio of the populations depends exponentially on the temperature. Because the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So when T decreases, the exponential term increases because as T goes down, 1/(k T) is larger (since k is a constant). So if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term is larger. So (n2/n1) increases when T decreases.

Wait, so when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). So (n2/n1) increases because T is lower. So the ratio n2/n1 becomes larger. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. Which matches the problem statement that when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases.

So without spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher, and with spots, it's lower. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But given that the ratio n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1), the factor becomes (n2/n1)_spots / (n2/n1)_no_spots. Because (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_spots = (1/(n2/n1)_no) ) / (1/(n2/n1)_spots )) ) = (n2/n1)_spots / (n2/n1)_no.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the ratio (n1/n2). Without spots, T is higher. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE = E2 - E1 (since E2>E1 for emission at 1448 Å). Wait no, when E2 > E1, the transition is from higher to lower, so the photon emitted has energy E2-E1. So for the ratio (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp increases. So (n1/n2) increases when T increases. So without spots, T is higher, so (n1/n2) is higher. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so (n1/n2) is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher without spots.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

Wait, because (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)), so when you take the ratio, the (g1/g2) cancels out. So the ratio is exp(ΔE/(k T_no)) / exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) ) )

So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T_no - 1/T_spots ] )

We can compute this. Let's compute the exponent.

First, we need to find ΔE. Since the wavelength λ corresponds to the transition between the two levels, so ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, let me see: the energy difference between the two levels is given by E2 - E1 = hc / λ. Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of energy E2-E1 = hc/λ.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

But let me get the numerical values.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372.

So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J per atom.

But wait, we might need this in terms of eV or something else, but perhaps we can proceed with this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent without plugging in all the constants, because the same constants will cancel out.

Let me express the exponent as:

ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots )

But let's think in terms of the ratio. Let me compute (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) = (T_spots - T_no)/(T_no T_spots) )

Wait, wait: 1/T_no - 1/T_spots = (T_spots - T_no)/(T_no T_spots )

No, wait: 1/a - 1/b = (b -a)/(a b). So if T_spots is lower than T_no, then 1/T_spots is higher than 1/T_no.

So in our case, T_no is 6000 K, T_spots is 5500 K.

So 1/T_no = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

1/T_spots = 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1

So 1/T_no - 1/T_spots = (1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4) = -1.515e-5 K^-1

Wait, wait: 1/T_spots is larger than 1/T_no, so 1/T_no - 1/T_spots is negative.

So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5)

Which is negative. So the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is a number less than 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the factor is exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) )

So this factor is exp( [ΔE/(k)] * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is [ΔE/(k)] * ( (5500 - 6000) ) / (6000 * 5500) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1/T_no is 1/6000, 1/T_spots is 1/5500.

Wait, no, the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (1/T_no - 1/T_spots )

Which is [ΔE/(k)] * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )
