Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. There are some options given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided. Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I need to visualize that structure.

Hint b) mentions IR spectra. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). Compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl but perhaps a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes usually show higher wavenumbers than ketones. So, a peak around 1715 is probably a ketone. So E has a ketone group.

Okay, so let me think about each step.

First, Compound A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN is typically used in reactions to form cyanohydrins or maybe to do a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but if A has a carbonyl group, then reacting with HCN could add a cyanide group. Let me think: ketones reacting with HCN usually form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, B would be the cyanohydrinâ€”so a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached?

Wait, but another possibility is that if A is an aldehyde, then HCN could add to the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin as well. But the reaction conditions might matter. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or something else. Hmm.

But looking at the next step, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Hydrogenation typically reduces triple bonds, double bonds, or other unsaturated groups. So if B has a triple bond or a double bond, hydrogenation would saturate it.

Wait, but if B is a cyanohydrin, it has an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. I'm not sure how that would be reduced. Alternatively, perhaps B is an alkyne, but that's a thought. Wait, no, HCN adding to a carbonyl would form an alcohol and a nitrile group? Maybe.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the structure from hint a). The product from a reaction of A with a phosphorous ylide is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes. So the ylide would have a carbanion part that attacks the carbonyl, forming a new double bond.

So the structure they give is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me draw it mentally: cyclopentane with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, right?

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part: like (CH2)2C- with a double bond, so something like CH2-C(CH3)=. So when the Wittig reaction occurs, the ylide (which is a strong base) attacks the carbonyl group of compound A, forming an alkene.

So the product is cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, maybe I should think about the positions. The substituent is at position 4 of the cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has a double bond formed between which two carbons? Let me think: the Wittig reaction forms a new double bond. So in the product, the substituent from the ylide is attached to the cyclopentane, and the new double bond is between C1 and C2, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Cyclopentane ring. At position 1: CH3, position 2: another CH3, and position 4: a CH2-C(CH3)= group, but that doesn't form a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait
