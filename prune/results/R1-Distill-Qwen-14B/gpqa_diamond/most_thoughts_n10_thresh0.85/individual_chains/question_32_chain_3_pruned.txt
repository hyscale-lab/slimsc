Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, I should probably use the relativistic energy equations.

The speed is given as 0.96c. I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, sometimes when they talk about the energy of the collider, they refer to the kinetic energy. Or do they mean the total energy? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The problem says 'energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c'. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain speed, and the energy they have is their kinetic energy. Or wait, no, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Alternatively, sometimes colliders are described by the kinetic energy per particle, but maybe in this context, the energy is the total energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the energy of the collider. I think in such cases, they usually refer to the kinetic energy imparted to each ion. Or perhaps the total energy (relativistic energy) of each ion. Hmm.

I should probably calculate both possibilities and see which one fits the options given.

Okay, first, let's find the relativistic gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - that is 0.0784. Square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, 0.28 is exact? Let me check: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yes, gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 10/2.8 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is needed. The mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... Well, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 grams per mole. Wait, actually, I think the exact mass would be better. Alternatively, I can use the mass of a proton and neutron.

A proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the rest mass energy is 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). Let's calculate that.

Proton: 938 MeV
Neutron: 939.565 MeV

So 3*(938 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.565) = let's compute that.

1877.565 *3: 18
