Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor, right? The ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E1 and E2 are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the star becomes cooler when it has spots. And the ratio of Ti in these levels decreases in the presence of spots.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. So, when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So, when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher. We need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me think. The ratio depends on the exponential term. Because the statistical weights (g factors) are probably constant, assuming the same element and same levels. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(kT) ). Let me denote (E1 - E2) as ΔE. So the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ).

Wait, but the transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å. I can find the energy difference using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. Wait, but I need to know if it's E1 higher than E2 or vice versa. For emission or absorption lines, the transition is from higher to lower energy. But in the Boltzmann factor, ΔE is E1 - E2, so if E1 is higher, then ΔE is positive. But for the ratio n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), as per the Boltzmann equation.

So, suppose E2 is lower than E1. So ΔE is positive. Then, as temperature T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases. So, the ratio n1/n2 increases with temperature.

Wait, no. Wait, if E1 > E2, then E1 - E2 is positive. So, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Let me think about this. If T increases, the denominator kT is bigger, so the exponent becomes smaller (less negative?), so the exponential increases. So, n1/n2 increases when T increases.

So, when the star is spotless (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher than when it has spots (T=5500 K). Because when the star has spots, the overall T is lower, so the ratio decreases.

The question states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. That makes sense with our earlier conclusion.

So, to find the factor by which the ratio changes, we need to compute (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (n1/n2)_5500K.

Wait, n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so the ratio of the ratios is (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) ) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Wait, (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that again. The ratio is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp(ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) )
