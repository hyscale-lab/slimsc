Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Oh right, because spots are cooler regions, so when part of the surface is covered, the average temperature decreases.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is higher, and it decreases when spots are present. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots vs. spots.

The key here is probably the Saha equation, which relates the ionization state of atoms to temperature and electron density. But wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can use the Boltzmann equation for energy levels since ionization isn't the main factor here. Because the Saha equation deals with ionization, but here we're talking about neutral atoms, so maybe it's about the distribution of energy levels within the same ion.

Wait, the ratio is for neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the Boltzmann equation applies. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the transition is at about 1448 Å, but I'm not sure if the specific wavelength is needed directly. Oh wait, perhaps it's used to find the energy difference between the two levels. Because each photon corresponds to a certain energy.

So, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels can be found using the photon energy E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) = approx 1.37e-18 J per photon.

But wait, to get it into terms of k (Boltzmann constant), which is 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me convert E into units of k*T.

So, E/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = approximately 1e5 K. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.37/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5
