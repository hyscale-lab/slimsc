Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, first, what do I know about these symmetries? Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Then there's CP symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). CPT symmetry combines charge, parity, and time reversal, and it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory according to the CPT theorem.

Now, SMEFT is built by adding operators to the Standard Model that are higher-dimensional terms. These operators must preserve the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. So which symmetries are these?

The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT must too. Poincare symmetryâ€”since the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory and also respects spacetime translations (which makes it a Poincare-invariant theory), SMEFT should also respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in SMEFT, operators are classified based on their dimension. The SM operators are renormalizable, so SMEFT adds non-renormalizable terms. But all these operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Lorentz and Poincare.

So 1 and 2 must be correct. Now what about CP and CPT? The Standard Model is CP-symmetric except for certain parts, like in the CKM matrix which leads to CP violation. Wait, but the SM isn't CP symmetric overall because of the CKM phase. So does that mean SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP symmetry? Or does CP symmetry have to be explicitly broken?

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry, then the SMEFT operators don't have to either. So maybe CP symmetry isn't a requirement. But wait, isn't the SMEFT constructed in a way that maintains the same gauge symmetries as the SM? So maybe CP isn't a requirement for the operators.

Alternatively
