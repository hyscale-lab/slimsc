Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula given is like number of stars N = 1 / plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. But in the question, N varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as plx^(-5). Since plx is 1/d, plx = (1/d), so plx^(-5) is d^5. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. If plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be (1/plx)^5, which equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, right, perhaps it's about the density or the number per unit distance. So maybe each shell at distance d has a certain number of stars, and we want to find how the number in each shell (which depends on the volume, perhaps) changes with d.

Wait, but another thought: the number of stars in a given volume is often considered to be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution. But wait, the problem says that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Which would be d^5, since plx is 1/d.

But wait, maybe it's not about the volume. Let me think again. If the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then the number of stars increases
