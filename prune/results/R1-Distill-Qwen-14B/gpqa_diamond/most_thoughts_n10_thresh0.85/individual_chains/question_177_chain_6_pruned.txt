Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question says. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is determined by their temperatures because of Wien's Law. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because Wien's Law says lambda_max = constant / T.

Then, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, does that affect the temperature as we perceive it? Because if a star is moving away, the light would be redshifted, but since the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe we have to correct for that when considering their actual temperatures.

Wait, but the question says they "appear" brightest at the same wavelength. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual temperatures might differ because of their velocities. Or does the Doppler shift not affect the temperature measurement? Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux but not the temperature. Wait, no, because the temperature is an intrinsic property. If Star_2 is moving towards or away, the observed wavelength shifts, but the star's actual temperature is the same as what we calculate from the peak wavelength. Wait, no, because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the peak would be at a shorter wavelength. But in the problem, the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift is accounted for in the observed data, meaning that the actual temperatures of the stars might be different.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But because of their velocities, their rest frame lambda_max would be different. So to find the actual temperatures, we have to correct for the Doppler shift.

So let's think about the Doppler effect. The Doppler shift formula is approximately (1 + v/c) for small velocities, but better to use the relativistic formula. But since 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c), but perhaps we can approximate.

Wait, but wait. If a star is moving towards us with velocity v, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted) by a factor of approximately sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ). Or wait, no, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift when the source is moving towards the observer is lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ) for a source moving towards the observer. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, better to think: when a source moves towards you, the observed
