Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels for the boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(v + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I can parse this better. It looks like the interaction term involves the boson X coupling to fermions. The structure is similar to Yukawa couplings, which are common in particle physics, like in the Higgs interaction.

In Yukawa theory, the interaction term is usually something like ψ̄ ψ multiplied by a scalar (here, X plus a constant v, maybe v is the vacuum expectation value? Or perhaps it's just another constant). The fermions that X can interact with are the ones present in the Lagrangian. So the fermions ψ are the ones that can decay into, right?

Wait, but the question is about the decay of X. So X can decay into a pair of fermions if the mass of X is sufficient. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

Wait, no. Actually, in decay processes, each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than half of X's mass. Because in decay X → f f̄, each f must have m_f ≤ M_X / 2. Because the rest mass of the fermion has to be less than or equal to the available energy each particle gets when X is at rest. If X is at rest, each fermion would have energy M_X / 2, so their mass must be ≤ that.

So I need to list all possible fermion pairs where each fermion has mass ≤ 3 GeV. Let me list the masses of known fermions:

Electron (e⁻): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (μ⁻): ~0.1057 GeV.
Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV.
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but in real life, it's more like 2.2 MeV, so ~0.0022 GeV).
Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV (about 4.7 MeV?).
Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV.
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV? Wait, no, strange quark is heavier. Wait, let me get this right. Wait, up and down are light, then strange is around ~100 MeV, but maybe I should double-check. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think:

Quark masses (current, approximate):

u: ~2 MeV
d: ~4-5 MeV
s: ~95-100 MeV
c: ~1.27 GeV
b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
t: top quark is ~173 GeV (way too heavy, so can't be part of X's decay since M_X is 6 GeV).

Leptons:

e: ~0.0005 GeV
mu: ~0.105 GeV
tau: ~1.777 GeV.

So for each fermion f, m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion pair:

1. Electron pair: e⁺ e⁻. Mass is negligible, so definitely allowed.

2. Muon pair: mu⁺ mu⁻. Mass ~0.105 GeV each. Sum is 0.21 GeV, <<6 GeV. So allowed.

3. Tau pair: tau⁺ tau⁻. Each is ~1.777 GeV. Sum is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

4. Up quark pair: uū. Each u is ~0.0022 GeV, so sum ~0.0044 GeV. Allowed.

5. Down quark pair: dđ. Each ~0.0047 GeV, sum ~0.0094 GeV. Allowed.

6. Strange quark pair: sš. Each s quark is ~0.1 GeV, sum ~0.2 GeV. Allowed.

7. Charm quark pair: c c̄. Each is ~1.27 GeV, sum ~2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

8. Bottom quark pair: b b̄. Each is ~4.5 GeV. Sum is ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So not allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs are e⁺e⁻, mu⁺mu⁻, tau⁺tau⁻, uū, dđ, sš, c c̄.

Wait, but what about other possibilities like charm quarks? Oh yes, as I thought, charm has 1.27 GeV per quark, so sum 2.54 <6, so allowed.

So the possible decay channels for X are into each of these pairs.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

Option A: X → b b̄, sš, uū, dđ, tau⁺tau⁻, e⁺e⁻.

But wait, X can't decay into b b̄ because 4.5*2=9>6. So option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X → c c̄, sš, uū, dđ, tau⁺tau⁻, mu⁺mu⁻, e⁺e⁻.

So that would include all except the bottom quark and possibly others. Wait, does it have charm? Yes, 'c c̄' is included.

Option C: Includes t t̄, but top is way too heavy. So option C is wrong because top can't be produced.

Option D: Includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So option D is wrong.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option A) includes b and s, u, d, tau, e.

So A's list includes b, which is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV total, which is above 6 GeV. So A is incorrect.

Option B) includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Each of these is allowed. So B is a possible correct option.

Option D) includes b, mu, e, tau, etc. So because of b, it's incorrect.

Wait, but what about the particle content in the Lagrangian? Because the interaction term given is -λ_f f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Wait, so the interaction is with ψ_f, which I think refers to fermions. So which fermions are present? The Lagrangian may only allow couplings to certain fermions.

Wait, in the given Lagrangian, it's written as λ_f f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but perhaps the term is something like λ ψ̄ (v + X) ψ, where ψ is a fermion. So which fermions are present? The notation is a bit unclear, but perhaps the f in λ_f f is an index over fermion species. So perhaps X couples to all the fermions f, with coupling λ_f.

But the question says, what are the kinematically allowed decays? Regardless of whether the interaction is present or not. Wait no, because if X doesn't interact with a certain fermion, that decay channel isn't possible. So the interaction term determines which fermions X can decay into.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which fermions are in the Lagrangian. The interaction term involves ψ_f, which are the fermion fields. So X couples to any fermion ψ_f, so X can decay into any pair of ψ_f fermions, as long as their mass is allowed.

But in the problem, perhaps the term is written in a way that
