Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so the first part is about the formation of a nitrile from a ketone. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So I'm thinking, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, so perhaps the cyanide ion is acting as a nucleophile here.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. So the mechanism would be the cyanide attacking the carbonyl carbon. Then, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which could pick up a proton. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw this out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the cyanide added to the carbonyl, and the oxygen has a hydroxyl group. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. But under what conditions does that happen? Usually, for such additions, you might need a protic acid to generate the nucleophile, but NaCN is already providing CN-.

Wait, but in the presence of a protic acid like H3O+ as a catalyst. Oh, right! So in some cases, especially when the nucleophile is a weak one, you might protonate the carbonyl to make it more electrophilic. So A is probably H3O+ because in the first step, the ketone would react with H+ from H3O+ to form a better electrophile, making the carbonyl more positive, which then attracts the CN-.

So for the first reaction, Reagent A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like a benzyl group attached to a phenyl ring, connected to a carbon which has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. So the molecule is (PhCH2)Ph-C(OH)-CN, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but the key is that it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under various conditions. Two common methods are acidic or basic conditions. The product depends on the conditions. For example, under strong acidic conditions, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, while under basic conditions, they might form amides or other products, which then can be acidified.

Looking at the reagents, the second reaction uses reagent B along with H2O. So what reagent would promote hydrolysis of nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

Typically, for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, you can use a strong acid or strong base. If using H2O as the solvent, adding HCl (a strong acid) would acidify the solution, leading to the formation of the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, sometimes H2SO4 or other acids are used.

Looking at the options, option A says B is HCl. Option C says B is HCl. So let's think.

Wait, but wait. Another way to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids is through the Stephen reduction, but that's using H2O and a catalyst. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in two steps. First, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to an amide under basic conditions, then the amide is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. Alternatively, in one step, using strong acidic conditions, the nitrile can be directly converted to the carboxylic acid.

But in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. Because the product is a carboxylic acid, and HCl is a strong acid. So when you add HCl (B) and water, the nitrile group converts to a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → This fits. First reaction uses H3O+ as A, second uses HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → Not sure about B. Acetic acid is a weak acid. Maybe for the second reaction, but I think HCl is more likely here because it's a strong acid needed for the hydrolysis.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-. Not sure how that fits. For the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as A... but the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. I don't think NaHSO3 is the right catalyst here. H3O+ is more appropriate.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → Doesn't seem right for either.

So putting it together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That's option A.


The first reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of cyanide (CN⁻) to butan-2-one, a ketone, to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. For this reaction, the carbonyl group of the ketone is protonated by a protic acid (H₃O⁺) to enhance its electrophilicity, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Thus, reagent A is H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl (B). HCl acidifies the reaction mixture, facilitating the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the required conditions for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not facilitate nucleophilic addition to the ketone.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is appropriate for the respective reactions.

The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
