Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. The formula I remember is distance = 1 / (parallax * some constant), but maybe the exact constant doesn't matter here.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1 / plx^5. So Number ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to relate this to distance. Since plx is proportional to 1/distance, let's write that as plx = k / r, where k is some constant and r is the distance. So plx = k/r → plx^5 = k^5 / r^5.

Now, substituting plx^5 into the number equation: Number ∝ 1/(plx^5) = 1/(k^5/r^5) )= r^5/(k^5). Since k is a constant, the number is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's the rate of change, like dN/dr.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential quantities. Let me think: If N is the number of stars, and N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4, which suggests a ~ r^4. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the number per unit volume? Not sure.

Wait, let me rephrase the problem. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/(d), where d is distance. So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. But wait, how does this translate to the number per unit distance?

Wait, no. Because in a given region of the sky, as you look further away, the volume you're considering increases. So maybe the number of stars in a thin shell at distance
