Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, I'll need to think this through step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but their detection limits are different. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it's easier to detect. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's easier. Wait, no: higher magnitude numbers mean fainter. So, if a star is brighter than 17, that's apparent V magnitude <17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitude up to 17. So a star with apparent mag 17 is barely detectable, and anything brighter (like 16) is definitely detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so up to 16 mag. Wait, no, wait: the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, that wording
