Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that the operator P is the angular momentum operator, right? And in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have specific forms for their components.

Wait, the problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me write those down. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with (0,-i) in the first row and (i,0) in the second row. That's the Pauli Y matrix, so P_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal with elements 1 and -1. So P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. θ here is the polar angle from the z-axis, I think.

The general form of the angular momentum operator along a direction n is P = (P_x x hat + P_z z hat) · σ, but wait, no, more accurately, P = ħ/2 (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Since it's in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me represent |ψ> as a two-component vector [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers. Then, the equation becomes:

[ (ħ/2) ( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Dividing both sides by ħ/2:

( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) [a; b] = [a; b]

Let me write out the matrix for ( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ). 

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So adding sinθ σ_x and cosθ σ_z gives:

[ [ cosθ*1, sinθ*1 ],
  [ sinθ*1, -cosθ*1 ] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which implies:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, so I need to solve these equations for a and b.

Wait, these are two equations, but they may not be independent. Let me try to find the ratio of a to b.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] b

But cosθ -1 is in the denominator. Let me factor that. Alternatively, note that cosθ-1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Let me see:

So,

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b = [ -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel. 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) divided by 2 sin^2(θ/2) → [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2). So a = [ cot(θ/2) ] b.

So a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b → a = [ cot(θ/2) ] b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2). So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b; b ] → which can be written as b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But since the eigenvector is only defined up to a scalar multiple, I can take b=1, so the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

Wait, but I should check if this also satisfies equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substituting a = cot(θ/2) b:

sinθ * cot(θ/2) * b + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ sinθ cot(θ/2) - cosθ -1 ] b = 0.

Since b is not zero (it's an eigenvector), the expression in brackets must be zero.

Let me compute sinθ cot(θ/2):

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

So sinθ cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] ] = 2 cos^2(theta/2)

Then, the expression becomes:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - cos theta - 1.

But wait, cos theta = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1. So substituting:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - (2 cos^2(theta/2) -1) -1 = 2 cos^2 - 2 cos^2 +1 -1 = 0.

So equation 2 is satisfied. So the ratio a/b is indeed cot(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize it. So the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ], and we need to find its normalization.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But a = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), and b=1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ cos^2(theta/2) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos^2 + sin^2 ] / sin^2 = 1 / sin^2(theta/2).

So normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2) ) = |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is an angle between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)), 1 ] * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, no, because when you have [a, b] = [ (
