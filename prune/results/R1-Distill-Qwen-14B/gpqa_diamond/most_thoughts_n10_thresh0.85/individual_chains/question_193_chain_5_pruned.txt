Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are about different power laws relating the number of stars to r.

Alright, I need to relate parallax to distance and then find out how the number of stars depends on distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. Right, that's the basic parallax formula.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars as a function of parallax. So the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give me N proportional to (1/(1/r))^5. Let me compute that. (1/(1/r)) is just r, so r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe I'm not directly getting the answer yet.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * (r)^5.

But wait, the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So I think I need to find how N changes as a function of r, and then find the derivative or something like that. Or perhaps it's about the number density.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of differential number. Like, how many stars are there between distance r and r + dr. That could be the case. So if N is the number of stars within a certain distance, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr.

Wait, let's clarify. The initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So N = constant * r^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. I think per unit distance, so maybe the rate of change of N with respect to r. So dN/dr would be the rate of change. Let's compute that.

dN/dr = d/dr (k r^5) = 5k r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of r per unit distance. So the correct answer would be ~r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think another way. Another approach is to consider that the number of stars in a volume element. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume times some density function.

Wait, but wait the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So if N(r) = kr^5, then the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr is dN = 5kr^4 dr. But wait, the volume element is 4π r² dr. So if the density is uniform, then the number would be N = density * volume. So density would be N / volume, which would be (kr^5)/(4π r² dr) = kr^3/(4π dr) – but that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct. The number of stars is proportional to r^5, so the derivative dN/dr is 5 r^4, making the rate of change of the number of stars with
