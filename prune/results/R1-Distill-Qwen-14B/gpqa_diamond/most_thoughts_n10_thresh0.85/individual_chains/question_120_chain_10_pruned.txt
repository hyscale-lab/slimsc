Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), like p = 1/d or something like that. Wait, I think the formula is p (in parsecs) = 1/d (where d is in parsecs), so as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So like, if you have a range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in each bin (each small unit of parallax) change as you go to higher parallaxes. Since higher parallax means closer stars, I need to think about how many stars are in each parallax bin.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, but uniform in what sense? Uniform in space or on the sky? The question says "uniformly distributed in the sky." Oh, wait, in the sky means that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform. So their distribution in terms of angles (like right ascension and declination) is uniform. But their distances? Probably not uniform, because the density of stars varies with distance.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I think it's more about how many stars are within a certain parallax range. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, maybe I should think in terms of distance.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, that might mean that the number density of stars is uniform
