Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my mechanics classes that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are going to be a bit different compared to the classical case.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this oscillator. The options are given as A to D, each with a different formula. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should recall the basics. In the classical, non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy U for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. So, the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv_max². Setting U = K gives (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max, I get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (A) * sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The options here have a relativistic twist, so that's not the end of the story.

In relativity, as objects move at speeds comparable to the speed of light c, their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, in the relativistic case, the total energy of the oscillator isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential; but wait, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, and in the ground state, the average kinetic and potential energies are equal, but maybe that's a different context. Wait, no, for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic scenario, the energy equation is different.

Wait, but the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a relativistic harmonic oscillator, but with Hooke's law still holding. Hmm, so the force is the same as the classical case, but the motion is relativistic. So perhaps the potential energy still is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. In the relativistic scenario, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would be different from the classical one. The equation would involve terms with velocity squared over c squared. But perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So at maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (x=0), and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is equal to the maximum kinetic energy when x=0.

Wait, but when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. Then when it passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. So in that case, the total energy E is equal to (γ - 1)mc² at that point.

So, the total energy E is the same as the potential energy when x = A. So E = (1/2)kA². Because in the classical case, the potential at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy formula change? Hmm, the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential energy would still be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)kx².

So, E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, all of that energy is kinetic, so E = (γ - 1)mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

But wait, I thought the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

We can solve for γ:

γ = (1/2 k A² / (mc²)) ) + 1.

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let me call that term 'a'. So,

γ = 1 + a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 +a)^2 ].

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ] ) .

Substituting a back,

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ] )

Wait, let me compute 1 + a: that would be 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 ] )

Hmm. Let me see the options. Option D is:

D) v_max = c√(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Wait, that's exactly what I have here. So, this would suggest D is the correct answer.

But wait, I should double-check my reasoning because sometimes these things can be tricky. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, so the total energy comes from the potential energy when x = A. That's (1/2)k A². At x=0, all of that is kinetic energy, which in relativistic terms is (γ-1) mc². So,

(1/2)k A² = (γ -1) mc².

Then, solving for γ:

γ = ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + a.

Then, since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we have:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Which gives,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, but let's look at the other options. Option B is c√(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ), but it's inside the square root as 1 + 1/(something), or something else. Let me see the actual options.

Wait, the options are:

A) v_max= c√(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

B) v_max= c√(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

C) v_max= sqrt( k A²/m )

D) v_max= c√(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So, my result is option D.

Wait, but did I make any mistake in the substitution? Let me recheck the substitution.

Yes, a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So in the denominator, 2 m c².

So yes, the denominator is correct.

Alternatively, could I have made a mistake in the total energy assumption?

Hmm. In the classical case, the energy is (1/2)k A², and that's all. But in relativistic contexts, perhaps the
