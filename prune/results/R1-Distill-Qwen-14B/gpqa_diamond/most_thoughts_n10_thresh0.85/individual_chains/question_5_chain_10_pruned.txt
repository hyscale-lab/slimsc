Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

First, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are used to represent the spin operators. The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So, the general form of the operator P along direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be the sum of the components multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So, the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero. So the direction is θ from the z-axis.

The operator P is given by P = (ħ/2) [ σ_x * n_x + σ_y * n_y + σ_z * n_z ].

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P simplifies to (ħ/2)(σ_x n_x + σ_z n_z). Substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, that becomes (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

So the matrix form of P would be (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]? Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying each by their coefficients:

σ_x * sinθ = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
σ_z * cosθ = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together: [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So overall, P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm the addition:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

To find the eigenvector, I need to solve the equation P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, writing the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so we're left with:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So, two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Simplify equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0? Wait, wait. Let me recheck:

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → a = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b

Hmm, so from equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Substituting a from equation 2 into equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) [ (1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) * b ] + sinθ b = 0

Factor out b: [ (cosθ -1)(1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) ) + sinθ ] = 0.

Compute numerator:

(cosθ - 1)(cosθ +1) = cos²θ - 1 = -sin²θ.

So the first term becomes (-sin²θ)/(sinθ) ) = - sinθ.

So the equation becomes: (-sinθ ) + sinθ = 0 → 0=0, which is an identity. So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b

Let me write b as a parameter. Let's let b = 1. Then a = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

But wait, maybe I can express this in terms of half-angle identities. Because 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2), and b = 1.

Thus, the eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T. But wait, I need to normalize this vector.

So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But wait, the components may have complex numbers? Because in some cases, eigenvectors can be complex. Wait, in this problem, the operator P is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors should be real. Because for spin-½ systems, the spin matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors can be chosen real.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n. So the eigenvector can be written in terms of θ and φ, but since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so the vector is in terms of θ only.

But wait, in our case, the eigenvector components are real. So a is real, as is b.

So, the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But wait, cot(θ/2) can be written as cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So the vector is [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ].

Let me compute the normalization:

|a|² + |b|² = [ cos²(θ/2) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2) ) = [1]/ sin²(θ/2) ) 

So to normalize, the vector should be multiplied by sin(θ/2), because [1/sin²(θ/2)]^(-1/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because:

Original vector: [ a, b ] = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]

Multiply each component by sin(θ/2):

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Which is already normalized, since cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, but wait, because [a, b] was [cot(theta/2), 1], and when you factor out 1/sin(theta/2), you have:

a = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) → a = cos(theta/2) * (1/sin(theta/2))

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But wait, this seems to suggest that the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's for a spin-up state along a direction theta, phi=0.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector
