Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Oh right, parallax (p) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is p = 1/d, where d is the distance to the star, measured in parsecs. So the bigger the parallax, the closer the star is.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... I think that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So, stars aren't clustered more in some areas than others. But how does this relate to parallax?

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, they're asking about N(∆p) for a given parallax range ∆p. Let me think about the geometry here. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is a constant. So n is the number of stars per unit volume.

Parallax p is related to distance d by p = 1/d. So d = 1/p. The volume of a sphere at distance d with radius dr would be (4/3)π( (d + dr)^2 - d^2 ), but wait, for small dr, that's approximately 4πd^2 dr. Because when dr is tiny, (d + dr)^2 ≈ d^2 + 2d dr, so the volume element is 4πd² dr.

But we need to relate this to parallax. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. Because derivative of d with respect to p is -1/p². So, dr = -(1/p²) dp. Since dr is positive, dp is negative because as p increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a range of p, let's say from p to p + dp, then dr is positive when dp is negative. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of absolute values.

So the volume element is 4πd² dr. Substituting d = 1/p, we get 4π (1/p)^2 * dr. But dr is (1/p²) dp in magnitude. So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, the number of stars in this volume element would be n multiplied by the volume element. So N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is N/(dp). So that's n * 4π / p^4. 

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So as parallax increases (p gets larger, meaning closer stars), the number per unit parallax range would decrease as 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that the volume element is 4πd² dr. And since dr = (1/p²) dp, substituting gives 4π*(1/p^2)*(1/p^2) dp) = 4π/p^4 dp. So the number of stars in that shell (the thin shell at distance d with thickness dr) is n * 4π/p^4 dp. So when you take N per unit dp, it's proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit p decreases by p^4.

So the answer should be option A, which is ~1/p^4. But wait, the options are A) ~1/plx^4, B) 1/plx^2, etc.

Wait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, maybe the distribution is being considered in terms of the number of stars per unit volume, and how that translates into the parallax distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars within a certain distance range. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars up to distance d is proportional to volume, which goes as d^3. So the number density is n, so number in a shell dr is 4πd² dr *n. But since p = 1/d, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting that in:

Number of stars in a shell at p is n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n*4π / p^4 dp. So per unit p, it's 1/p^4.

So yeah, that makes it option A.

Wait, but another approach: consider the distribution in terms of the probability of a star having a certain parallax. The probability density function (pdf) for parallax p would be proportional to the number of stars in a thin shell at p. So the number of stars in a thin shell is 4πd² dr *n. As before, but converting to p, it's 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp * n. So the pdf is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit p is 1/p^4.

So the answer would be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density \( n \) (stars per unit volume) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dr \), multiplied by the number density \( n \), resulting in \( 4\pi n d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), the volume element becomes \( 4\pi n (1/p^2) dr \). Additionally, \( dr \) can be expressed in terms of \( dp \) as \( dr = -(1/p^2) dp \) (for small \( dp \)).

Substituting \( dr = -(1/p^2) dp \) into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we get:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = 4\pi n (1/p^2) \cdot (1/p^2) dp = 4\pi n (1/p^4) dp.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is then:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \). This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
