Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully and think about what each part means. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The problem says that because the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) will show periodic brightness changes due to the star's rotation. This setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet because when the spots rotate into and out of view, it affects the observed brightness, kind of like how a planet transiting a star blocks some light.

The question is asking: If there were no spots, what radius (Rpl/Rstar) would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, the brightness dip when the planet transits should be as big as the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm. So I think I need to calculate the relative brightness change for both the spot scenario and the planet transit, then set them equal and solve for the planet radius.

Wait, brightness variation in the case of spots. Spots are cooler, so when they face us (as the star rotates), they make the star appear slightly dimmer. The amount of dimming depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

First, let's think about the star with spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star is a sphere, but the spots cover one hemisphere, 20% of that hemisphere. So, the total area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of one hemisphere.

The area of a sphere is 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but wait, the star is only spotted on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out. The brightness variation is due to the spots being visible as the star rotates.

Each spot's area
