Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)), right? Oh wait, but wait, E_i is the energy of level i, and if E_i is higher than E_j, then the population n_i is lower because the exponent becomes negative.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me call that delta E, so delta E = E_2 - E_1. Wait, actually, the question says the energy difference was determined to be approximately 1.38e-23 J. But it's not clear which level is higher. But since star_1's atoms are twice as excited in a specific level, perhaps the level in question is higher in energy than the other? Or maybe lower?

Wait, no, the excitation being higher means more atoms are in that energy level. But wait, if a higher energy level is more populated, that would imply higher temperature because more energy is available. Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor for a higher energy level (higher E) would have a lower population unless the temperature is high enough.

Wait, so if in star_1, the population of a certain energy level is twice that of star_2, then for the same level, n1 = 2 n2. Let's assume that the energy levels are the same for both stars, so E_i is the same for both. So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )? Wait, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, the general form is n_i proportional to g_i exp( -E_i/(k T) ), where g_i is the statistical weight. So the ratio between two levels i and j is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). 

In this problem, I think we're considering the same transition in both stars. So for each star, the ratio is between the same two energy levels. So for star_1, the ratio of n_high / n_low is twice as much as for star_2. Wait, no, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps n1 = 2 n2 for the same level. But that might not be the case. Wait, actually, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, so for the same specific energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but
