Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's take a deep breath and break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks given are 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I remember that IR spectroscopy is useful for identifying functional groups. 

The 3400–2500 region is a broad range. I think that's usually where O-H or N-H stretches appear. The 1720 cm-1 peak stands out because that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. A carbonyl group is present here. Then there's a peak at 1610, which might be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 could be another aromatic ring vibration or maybe some kind of C-O stretch, but I'm not too sure about that.

Moving on to the NMR data. Let's note down each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. A singlet suggests no neighboring protons. A peak around 10 ppm is typically an aldehyde proton, but wait, that's usually around 9-10. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would be broad, but in D2O, it might exchange and not show up, or sometimes appear as a broad peak. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure because sometimes the aldehyde is around 9-10, but maybe this is an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. The IR has a 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl from a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 as well, which is in the first IR range mentioned (3400–2500). So that's a good sign for a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 10.5 ppm peak, maybe that's the -COOH proton. But wait, carboxylic acids in NMR typically show a broad peak around 10-12, but sometimes they can be even broader and might have split into a singlet if there's no adjacent protons.

Then the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each integrating to 2H suggest a substituent on the benzene ring, maybe in the para position. So the two doublets are for the two sets of aromatic protons—like, for example, a p-methyl group or another substituent causing the splitting.

The next peak is 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, which could be from a CH group attached to something. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone, but I'm not sure yet.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): another multiplet, integrating to 2H. Could be a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a larger substituent.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet? No, wait, it's a doublet. So that's a CH3 group attached to something that has two neighboring protons. Wait, a doublet for 3H—like a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a geminal group, but that's less likely. Maybe it's a CH3 connected to a CH which is connected to another group.

And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet, which is typical for a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain. So that's probably a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Because the IR has a strong carbonyl and the broad peak in NMR at 10.5 ppm would fit an acidic proton from the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would have a benzene ring with substituents and a COOH group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached at position 2. That would make the structure something like CH2-COOH attached to a benzene ring which has an ethyl group in the para position.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group at position 4. Wait, but if the substituents are at 4, would the aromatic protons split into two doublets? Let me think. If the substituents are at para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two each, which fits the NMR data.

Wait, but if the COOH is at position 4 and the substituent is a Sec-butyl group also at position 4, that can't be since the ring can't have two substituents in the same position. So perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and another position, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1 (like para to each other). Or perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at a different position. Hmmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, wait, actually, if the benzene has a substituent at the para position, then the adjacent protons would be split into specific patterns. Alternatively, if the substituent is in the ortho and para positions, but that might complicate the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that's causing the ring to have two sets of protons. For example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to another group, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent itself is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1, making the ring have two substituents in para positions relative to each other.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data suggests that the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, such as a COOH group and another substituent. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzoic acid where the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1 (or the other way around), but that would make them para to each other. But in that case, the ring would have two substituents in para positions, which would lead to the aromatic protons being split into two doublets. Let me think about this.

In a para-substituted benzene with two different groups, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split. For example, if you have substituents at positions 1 and 4, then the ring would have two sets of protons. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded and split into doublets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the ring has two substituents, each in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that splits the ring into two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is in the para position, and the ring is symmetric. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the two protons next to it (2 and 6 positions) would be equivalent, and the other two (3 and 5) would be equivalent. Wait no, because in that case, the substituent is para, so the adjacent protons (ortho) would be in the 2 and 6 positions, which would be equivalent, and the next (meta) would be 3 and 5, which would also be equivalent. So in that case, the aromatic protons would show two doublets: one for the ortho protons (2 and 6) and another for the meta (3 and 5). That would fit the NMR data of two doublets each with 2H.

So if the substituent is in position 4, then the ring would have two substituents: perhaps the COOH group in position 1 and another substituent in position 4? But that would make them meta to each other, not para. Wait, I'm confusing myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 4, and the COOH is in position 1. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4, making the COOH at position 1. But wait, in that case, the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH, so the ring would have two substituents para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets.

So looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituents are para to each other.

The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The substituent at position 4 would deshield the protons at positions 3 and 5, and the COOH at position 1 would deshield the protons at 2 and 6. Therefore, the protons adjacent to substituents would be in two sets: those next to the COOH (positions 2 and 6) and those next to the sec-butyl (positions 3 and 5). Each set would be a doublet, which matches the NMR data.

So that seems to fit. Now, let's look at the other parts of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH between the carbonyl and the substituent. Wait, COOH would be at position 1, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is attached to the ring as a -CH2-C(CH2CH3)2 group? Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but attached to the ring.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So the substituent would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the ring would be split into a certain pattern.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, after the aromatic protons, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H).

Hmm, let's think about the substituent. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain. The structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is attached to the benzene ring as a CH2 group connected to a CH, which is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Actually, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that's more like an iso-butyl group. Wait, no. Let me get this right. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be correct because the butyl group has four carbons. So, the correct structure is:

The substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2- group? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think: butyl groups.

A butyl group can have different structures based on substitution. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me count: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait. Wait, the substituent is a butyl group attached via the second carbon. So the substituent would be: CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is actually:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the benzene ring at the second carbon. So the group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would be a substituent in which the CH2 is attached to the ring, and the next carbon has two CH2CH3 groups? That can't be right because that would require a quaternary carbon. No, wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: that would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's a three-carbon group, but butyl is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's not the case here. Let's think again.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). A doublet suggests that the CH3 group is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that is connected to the ring. So like, CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent would be like:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

So the structure of the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a sec-butyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the ring. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent has a CH2 group attached to the ring, and then a CH group attached to that, which has two CH2CH3 groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would require the CH to have three substituents: the CH2 from the ring, two CH2CH3 groups, but that's only possible if the CH is a quaternary carbon, which isn't the case for a sec-butyl group. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me correct this.

The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But wait, that's a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the structure is:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

But that would make the substituent a three-carbon group, not four. Wait, no, the substituent is a butyl group, which has four carbons, so the substituent should be: 

-Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, that can't be right because that would be a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, that's only three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the substituent structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon, which would make it a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that would be a four-carbon substituent because the main chain is three carbons, including the attachment point. Wait, perhaps the substituent is:

The structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a three-carbon substituent, so perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data. The substituent has a CH2 group, then a CH group, then two CH3 groups. So looking at the NMR:

At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be the CH group in the substituent.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): that would be the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the CH. Wait, but in the substituent, the CH is attached to the ring via a CH2 group. So the CH2 group next to the ring would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. So that could be the CH2 next to the ring.

Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a doublet for 3H. That would be a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the CH group. Hmm, wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the group attached to the ring is CH2, followed by a CH that's connected to two CH2CH3 groups? No, wait, that would be a quaternary carbon.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a CH that has two CH2 groups attached. No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituent's structure again.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is: 

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- 

No, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon substituent, but the structure is:

The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, that's three carbons. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that's impossible because the CH can't have two CH2CH3 groups unless it's quaternary. So I must be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But that would make the substituent a tert-butyl group if it's attached to the second carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the terms mixed up.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the substituent's NMR signals.

The substituent has:

- a CH2 group next to the ring (appearing as a triplet, perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm). 

- a CH group in the middle (appearing as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm, integrating to 1H.

- and a CH2CH3 group attached to the CH. The CH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, which is an isobutyl group attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

In that case, the CH2 next to the ring would have protons that might split into a triplet if adjacent to another CH2. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could fit as a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

The CH group would have protons that are split into a multiplet. The CH3 group attached to the CH would have a triplet, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But I'm not getting the NMR to match. Let's look again.

The substituent would be: benzene ring attached to CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a four-carbon group.

The substituent's structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- 

Wait, that's a substituent with four carbons: the ring has a CH2 attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2CH3. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a four-carbon substituent (because the CH2-CH- is two carbons, and the CH2CH3 is another two, but perhaps that's not the right way to count).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a butane chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

So the substituent would have:

- CH2 (attached to the ring) → protons at certain ppm.

- CH (attached to the CH2 and to two CH2CH3 groups) → but wait, that can't be because that would require the CH to have three substituents, which would make it a quaternary carbon.

Ah, I see where I'm getting stuck. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, so the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- 

Wait, that's a three-carbon substituent, but butyl implies four. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a five-carbon substituent, which is a pentyl group. No, that's not right.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent structure. Maybe I should look at the other parts of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That suggests a CH group with neighboring CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 adjacent to a CH. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is likely a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Putting this together, the substituent would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent attached to the benzene ring is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a four-carbon substituent. Wait, that can't be because CH2-CH(CH2CH3) is three carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be five carbons, which is a pentyl group, but again, that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 adjacent to the ring would have two protons, appearing as a multiplet around 1.7 ppm. The CH group (the one attached to the two CH3 groups) would have no protons, but that's not the case here because the CH group has a proton in the NMR.

Wait, no, the CH group in an iso-butyl group is actually connected to three CH3 groups, so that would be a quaternary carbon without any protons, which doesn't fit the NMR data. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's an iso-butyl group. No, wait, the iso-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, which would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that's getting too long.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure here, so perhaps I should try another approach. Let's think about the reaction part of the question.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is used to reduce carbonyl groups to methylene groups. Wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner reaction is used to reduce ketones or aldehydes to alkanes, but that's under specific conditions with hydrazine and heat, often with a base. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, the Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg. Red phosphorus and HI are part of the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction for elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction: the use of HI and red phosphorus is often for the deoxygenation of ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a ketone (R-CO-R') would be reduced to R-CH2-R'. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a methylene group (CH2).

Wait, if compound X has a carbonyl group, after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, that group would be reduced. So if X is a benzoic acid (which has a carbonyl group in -COOH), then after this reaction, the -COOH would be converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, but wait, benzoic acid has a structure of benzene ring with a -COOH group. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus would deoxygenate the carbonyl, turning the -COOH into a -CH2OH group? Or maybe into a -CH2- group. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce carbonyl groups to CH2 groups, but maybe in the case of carboxylic acids, the reaction would proceed differently.

Wait, considering that X has a carbonyl group (from IR), and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group. So if X is a benzoic acid, after reaction, it would become benzyl alcohol? Or perhaps it would lose the oxygen and form a methylene group.

Wait, no, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI may not proceed the same way as with a ketone. Let me think again. The reaction conditions might be more specific.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution. For example, if X has a leaving group like a tosylate or something, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, thinking about elimination reactions, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of a carbonyl group. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, a ketone would be reduced to an alkane. But for a carboxylic acid, which has a carbonyl group, perhaps the reaction would reduce the -COOH group to a -CH2OH group. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction conditions are more likely to deoxygenate.

Wait, perhaps when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into an alkane. So the -COOH would become a -CH2- group.

Wait, let's think about the structure of X. If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, then after the reaction, the -COOH becomes a -CH2- group. So the product would have a benzene ring with a substituent and a CH2 group attached.

Looking at the options, after the reaction, the product would be something like a benzene ring with a substituent and a CH2 group, perhaps leading to a structure like benzyl something.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct product after the reaction would be one where the carbonyl group is replaced by a CH2 group. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, but let me look at the options again:

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the reaction again. If X is a benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would convert the -COOH group into a -CH2- group. So the product would be benzene with a -CH2- group and a sec-butyl substituent. That would give a structure like:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) 

Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent attached to the benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but only the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction replaces the carbonyl group with a CH2 group, so the benzoic acid becomes benzyl alcohol or something else. I'm a bit rusty on this reaction.

Wait, I think I should look for another approach. Let's go back to the NMR and IR data and see if I can figure out the structure of X.

The IR shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carboxylic acid or ester. The broad peak in the NMR at 10.5 ppm suggests an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid.

So X is probably a benzoic acid derivative. Let's try to reconstruct the structure.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So the substituents on the benzene ring are in positions that split the aromatic protons into two doublets each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two substituents. So perhaps the benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? I think the reaction would reduce the carbonyl group in the carboxylic acid to a methylene group. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think that under the reaction conditions of HI and red phosphorus, a carboxylic acid would be converted into a hydrocarbon. Let me think. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus would likely deoxygenate the carbonyl group, turning -COOH into -CH2-.

So the product would be benzene with a CH2 group attached and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

But wait, after reduction, the COOH group would become CH2OH, but red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to remove the oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation, turning the -COOH into a methyl group. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is similar to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So if X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction would reduce the -COOH group to a -CH2- group, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution. But I can't think of a substitution reaction that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but that doesn't fit with the reagents given.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The options given are after the reaction. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group in the para position and the COOH in position 2. But if X is a benzoic acid, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would not produce another benzoic acid.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4: an isobutyl group and a methyl group. But if X is a benzoic acid, after reduction, perhaps the COOH becomes a CH2 group, leading to a methyl group attached.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the starting material, so the product can't be this.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So it's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, the COOH group is converted into a CH2 group. So the product would be benzene with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. For example, if the -COOH is converted to -CH2-CH3. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into a benzyl alcohol. But again, that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but a substitution. For example, HI could cause an alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I don't see a leaving group in the starting material.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken about the reaction. Let's think about the reaction of red phosphorus with HI. Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form phosphine and iodide. The reaction can generate H-I, which is a source of iodide ions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide, but the starting material doesn't have a leaving group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the options again and see which one could be the product after the reaction.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then after the reaction, the COOH group is converted into something else. Perhaps the COOH becomes a CH2 group, leading to a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but option D has a methyl group at position 4. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling or alkylation, but I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the starting NMR again.

The NMR of X has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like a sec-butyl group.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a 2-propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, leading to the NMR signals we see.

In any case, I think the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the -COOH group is likely reduced to a -CH2- group, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in identifying the starting material. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure is a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure is CH2-COOH attached to a benzene ring that has an ethyl group in the para position.

The NMR would then have the aromatic protons as a doublet, but I'm not sure if that fits. Let's think about the aromatic protons: if the phenyl group is attached to the propanoic acid, then the phenyl would have substituents in the para position, leading to the two doublets in the NMR.

But I'm not sure if that would lead to the other signals in the NMR.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The structure is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. So the substituents are in the para positions.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would again be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits the given NMR data. Then, the substituents would be a sec-butyl group and a methyl group.

But wait, the starting material X would have to be a compound that upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would lose the COOH and form a methyl group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl carbonyl compound, which upon reaction forms a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the -COOH is reduced to a CH2 group, but then what? Let me think. The product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should make an educated guess. Based on the NMR and IR data, the starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus would reduce the -COOH group to a -CH2- group. However, none of the options show this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to a different structure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI could be a dehydrohalogenation, but that requires a halogen. Since X doesn't have a halogen, this might not apply.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkene via elimination, but again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should return to the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction for making alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. But since X is a benzoic acid, perhaps it's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the benzoic acid into benzyl alcohol. But again, I don't see that as an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, which would eliminate CO2 and form an alkane. So if X is a benzoic acid, after decarboxylation, it would form benzene with a CH3 group. But that's not matching the options either.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with the initial analysis that X is option C, and the reaction converts the -COOH into a CH2 group, leading to a structure that's not in the options. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the given data.

But how would the reaction of X lead to option D? If X is a compound with a COOH group, perhaps the reaction replaces it with a methyl group.

Wait, maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but that wouldn't have the NMR data we're seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but only the carbonyl group. So if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, the reaction would convert the -COOH into a CH3 group, making the product a toluene derivative.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C, and after the reaction, the product isn't listed, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of the COOH group, leaving a CH2 group.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

- The IR and NMR data point to X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

- The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carbonyl group, turning -COOH into -CH2-.

- The product isn't listed, but perhaps I'm missing something.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps X is not a benzoic acid but another compound, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, going back to the IR data: the 1720 cm-1 peak could also be from an ester or ketone. If it's a ketone, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would reduce it to a CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the NMR data doesn't fit that.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak could also be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm. But the IR would then have a carbonyl around 1720, which fits an aldehyde.

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, the aldehyde would be reduced to a CH2 group.

But then, looking at the options, option D is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and methyl group, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure about the reaction part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by something else. For example, a Grignard reaction, but that requires a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't see how that would apply.

Given the confusion, I think the best approach is to conclude that the correct starting material is option C, and the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into a CH2 group, but since the product isn't in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but adds a group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that doesn't fit the reagents given.

Hmm, I think I'll have to make a choice. Based on the NMR and IR data, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carbonyl group to a CH2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct product is option D.

Wait, option D has a methyl group, which might come from somewhere else. Maybe I'm missing something in the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a terminal CH3. That would fit with an ethyl group. But in option D, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, leading to a CH3 that's a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Then, the reaction might add a functional group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The IR would show a carbonyl, and the NMR would have the aromatic protons as doublets, the aliphatic protons matching a CH2 group.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on the NMR and IR data, I believe the correct starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carbonyl group to CH2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves identifying a compound (Compound X) based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Step 1: Analyzing IR Data
- The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch at **1720 cm⁻¹**, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. 
- The broad IR region (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

### Step 2: Analyzing NMR Data
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely from a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely from a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely from a terminal CH₃ group.

### Step 3: Identifying Compound X
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a **benzoic acid derivative** with a para-substituted aromatic ring and a sec-butyl group. This matches **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**:
- The para-substituted aromatic ring explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm).
- The sec-butyl group accounts for the CH, CH₂, and CH₃ signals in the aliphatic region (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm).
- The broad peak at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the -OH proton of the carboxylic acid.

### Step 4: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI typically results in the **deoxygenation of the carbonyl group**, converting the -COOH group into a -CH₂ group. For **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**, this reaction would yield **4-(sec-butyl)benzyl compound**. However, none of the options provided match this product.

### Step 5: Reassessing the Options
Given the options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed aliphatic signals.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not match the IR or NMR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the IR and NMR data but does not directly lead to any of the provided options after the reaction.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Suggests a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. This structure aligns with the aromatic NMR data but does not account for the carboxylic acid signals.

### Conclusion
Based on the IR and NMR data, **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)** is the most consistent with the spectral information. However, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not produce a product listed among the options. Given the constraints of the question, **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)** is the closest match, potentially representing a simplified or alternative interpretation of the reaction.
