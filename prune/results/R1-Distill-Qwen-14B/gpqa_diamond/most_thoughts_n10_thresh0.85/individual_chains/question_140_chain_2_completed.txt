Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it piece by piece.

First, the question involves a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. 

Wait, I remember that in organic chemistry, a common reagent is something like KMnO4, but maybe it's something else? Alternatively, maybe it's NaOH or something like that. But the question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must be an element or compound with an isotope.

Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas W has equal number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is like H2O? Wait, no, because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So in H2O, protons are 2, and neutrons are 8. Not equal. So maybe it's NH3? No, that's N and H. Let's think of other gases.

Wait, another thought: if the gas has same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule, perhaps it's something like CO2? No, because CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually), and 2 O (8 each). The molecule would have 12 protons and 12 neutrons? Wait, wait, no, the total for the molecule. Let me think again. For each molecule, total protons and total neutrons must be the same.

So, for a molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Let me think of possible molecules. Maybe CH4? No, CH4 has 6 protons and 4 H (each with 0 neutrons), so total protons 6, neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 0 (from H) =6. So yes, CH4 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, wait, the molecule would have protons and neutrons, but in the molecule's structure. Wait, the molecule's total protons and total neutrons are same.

Wait, another possibility: maybe CO? Let's see. CO has 1 C (6p,6n) and 1 O (8p,8n). So total protons 14, neutrons 14. Yes! So CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So gas W is CO.

Wait, but CO is a gas, but it's a bit toxic. Alternatively, could it be something else? Let's think. Another possibility: N2O. Let's see, N has 7 p and 7 n each, O has 8 p and 8 n. So N2O: 2*7 +8 =22 p, 2*7 +8=22 n. So same. So W could be N2O.

But which is more likely? Let's think about the reaction conditions. X reacts with liquid Y violently. So what's the liquid Y? Maybe water? Because if X is a metal, it could react with water. But then, the gas produced would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so they don't match. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, Y could be an acid, perhaps. Wait, but if Y is liquid, maybe it's something like sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Then X could be a metal reacting with acid to produce gas. But wait, what gas would that be? If X is a metal, it reacts with acid to produce H2, but as we saw earlier, H2 doesn't have equal protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. Wait, maybe Y is an alcohol? Or maybe it's a solution of something else.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Upon heating, G releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, so B is a solid that melts just above 0 C. Wait, what substances have melting points around there? Water is 273 K (0 C), so B might be water. Wait, but water is a liquid at 277 K. Unless it's a different solid. Wait, maybe it's another substance.

Wait, 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius. So ice (water) melts at 273 K (0 C), but if B's melting point is about 277 K, maybe it's something else. Hmm, perhaps another solid. Maybe a metal? Or a different compound.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two O atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. When X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction or an acid-base reaction. Or maybe a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, if X is something like NaOH, a strong base, then when it reacts with a keto acid (like acetic acid), it would produce sodium acetate, water, etc. But wait, the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, like sodium. Sodium reacting with a keto acid would produce a salt, water, and release gas. Wait, but the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider the first part of the question again. X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B. Wait, the product G is a precipitate which upon heating releases B. So perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid, the reaction produces H2 gas (but earlier saw that this might not fit), a precipitate like a sulfide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the isotopes. X incorporates a heavier isotope, so maybe X is a compound where one of its elements has a heavier isotope. For example, if X is NaOH, but the Na could be the heavier isotope. But perhaps X is something like KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with an acid, perhaps it produces MnO2 or something else.

Wait, getting back to the gas W. If W is CO, then the reaction might involve carbon being released. If X is a carbonate, perhaps reacting with an acid would produce CO2. But earlier, CO2's molecule has 22 protons (1 C, 2 O: 6 + 16 =22) and 22 neutrons (6 from C, 16 from O, but wait, the O usually has 8 neutrons each, so 16 in total. So total protons 22, total neutrons 6 + 16*2= 38? Wait no, that's for each molecule. Wait, no, wait, each molecule has a certain number of protons and a certain number of neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is CO. So each CO molecule has 1 C and 1 O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So each molecule has 14 protons in total. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons, O has 8. So total neutrons 14. So equal. So yes, CO could be the gas.

Then, when X reacts with Y, it produces CO. So what reaction produces CO?

Hmm, perhaps the reaction of a carbonate with a strong acid. Wait, no, that produces CO2. Alternatively, maybe a reaction involving oxides. Or perhaps a metal reacting with a carbonate solution?

Wait, if X is a metal, say sodium, and Y is a carbonate, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate itself. Let's think: if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and Y is a strong acid like H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2 gas. But wait, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, let's see: C has 6 p and 6 n, O has 8 p and 8 n. So CO2 has 6+8*2=22 protons, 6+8*2=22 neutrons. So yes, same number. So gas W would be CO2.

Wait, that fits. So, X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. So the precipitate G could be something else. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Na2CO3 is a carbonate. The reaction is:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But in this case, no precipitate is formed because all the products are soluble. So that can't be. So perhaps Y is a different liquid.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is a hydroxide solution, perhaps there's a reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a weak acid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and another oxide. So, for example, if G is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), heating would produce CaO and CO2. Then, B is CO2, but earlier, that would have a melting point of 273 K, which is close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, which is just above the melting point of water. So perhaps B is something else.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, then heating would produce CO2, which is a gas. But in that case, B would be CO2, but then the melting point would be that of CO2, which is much lower. Hmm, perhaps B is something else.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is sodium, Y is water, and the reaction produces sodium hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is about 277 K. Let's find a substance that's solid at that temperature. Water is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe B is something like ice, but that's 273 K. Alternatively, maybe it's another solid, like some organic compound. Or perhaps B is a metal. Hmm, for example, mercury is liquid at room temperature, but freezes at about 234 K. So not that. Lead has a higher melting point, but perhaps not around 277.

Wait, what about something like paraffin wax, which has a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid like glucose, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, decomposes into a metal oxide and water. For example, heating copper hydroxide would produce copper oxide and water. Then, B would be water, which melts at 273 K, but the question says it's 277 K. Close enough perhaps. So maybe G is a metal hydroxide, and upon heating, it loses water, producing a metal oxide and H2O as B.

So, for example, if G is Cu(OH)2, heating would produce CuO and H2O. But then W would be the gas released when X reacts with Y. Let me see.

Wait, X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B. Hmm, perhaps X is a metal, Y is a strong acid. The reaction would produce H2 gas, a salt (possibly G), and water (B). But earlier determined that H2 doesn't fit W because protons and neutrons aren't equal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but then I'm stuck.

Wait, let's think about substance X. It's a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. A common reagent is KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Or maybe it's NaOH, which is a strong base.

If X is NaOH, then reacting with a liquid Y could produce a precipitate. But what liquid would that be? Maybe Y is a solution of a salt that gives a precipitate with NaOH. For example, MgSO4 reacts with NaOH to produce Mg(OH)2 precipitate.

But then the gas W would have to come from this reaction. Wait, but Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate, but does the reaction produce a gas? Not sure. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But earlier that doesn't fit with the precipitate.

Wait, but if X is NaOH and Y is a ketone, perhaps there's an acid-base reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. When it reacts with an acid, like HCl, it produces CO2 gas and a precipitate? Wait, no, because HCl is a strong acid and Na2CO3 is soluble, so the reaction would produce NaCl, H2O, and CO2. No precipitate in that case.

Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid but something else. Let me think, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, then the reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate, and KNO3? Wait, but that's if it's a double displacement. Then the products would be BaCO3 (precipitate), K2CO3 (if X is K2CO3), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate. Then the reaction would produce a carbonate nitrate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, Ca(OH)2 reacts with an acid to produce Ca^2+ and water, but again no gas.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the precipitation. Suppose X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. The reaction produces CO2, a salt, and water. No precipitate, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is a sulfide. If X is a metal sulfide, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce H2S gas. But wait, H2S has 2 H (1 proton each, 0 neutrons) and 1 S (16 protons, 16 neutrons). So total protons 2+16=18, total neutrons 16. So 18 vs 16; not equal. So H2S doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO. So what reaction produces CO? Maybe the decomposition of a carbonate? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate. For example, Mg and Na2CO3 might react, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, FeO reacting with an acid would produce H2O and a salt. But then, no gas.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the gas part. Let me think of other possibilities. What about NO? NO has 7 (N) + 8 (O) = 15 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons, O has 8, so 15. So equal. So NO could be the gas W.

So, if the reaction produces NO gas. Then, what reaction produces NO? Typically, when a metal reacts with an acid containing nitrate ions, especially in a redox reaction. For example, Cu reacting with concentrated HNO3 produces NO3^- and NO.

Wait, but then X would be the metal. So X is Cu, Y is concentrated HNO3. The reaction produces Cu(NO3)2, water, and NO gas. But then, what about the precipitate G? Hmm, Cu(NO3)2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate reacting with a nitric acid. Let's think, Na2CO3 + 2HNO3 → NaNO3 + CO2 + H2O. No precipitate, so not matching.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two O atoms. What reaction could that be? Maybe a neutralization reaction, where X is a base and the keto acid is an acid. The product would be a salt and water. For example, if X is NaOH and the acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), then the product is CH3COO^- Na^+ and H2O. The product would have two O atoms in the acetate ion, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is referring to.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound that, when reacting with a keto acid, forms a compound with two O atoms. For example, if X is NaOH, and the acid is H2COOH (formic acid), then the product is NaCOOH, which has the formula NaHCOO. That has two O atoms? Wait, HCOO^- has two O: O from the acid and another O from the hydroxide? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the reaction could produce a metal acetate. For example, Mg reacts with acetic acid to form Mg(OAc)2. So each acetate has two O atoms? Wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O atoms per acetate ion. But the question says the product has two O atoms, so perhaps the product is a simple molecule with two O atoms, like H2O.

Wait, that might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like CO2, which has two O atoms. But how would that happen? If X is a carbonate reacting with a keto acid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a salt with two O atoms in its formula. For example, Na2O: sodium oxide. But that would have O in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a molecule like CO2, which has two O atoms. So the reaction between X and the keto acid produces CO2. That would imply that X is a carbonate, perhaps. But then the reaction between a carbonate and a keto acid would produce CO2? Not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to think of the elements in X. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must be a compound where one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, perhaps it's a chloride, and the Cl has a heavier isotope (like Cl-35 vs Cl-37).

Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So the elements in X have the lightest and heaviest isotopes. So for instance, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. The lightest elements would be H (1), but wait, Na is 23, Cl is 35. Wait, but if X is something else.

Wait, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X must be summed. So if X has elements A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, their atomic masses are added. So to find which option is correct, perhaps X has elements like Na and Cl.

Wait, but what if X is something like KCl (potassium chloride). Then the elements are K and Cl. K's atomic mass is about 39, Cl is about 35.5. So the sum would be 39 +35.5 = 74.5, which isn't an option. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Hmm, perhaps X has lighter elements. Let's think of X as NaOH. Then elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H, the heaviest is Na. Sum is 23 +1=24. Not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound like NH4NO3, which is ammonium nitrate. Then the elements are N, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not in options.

Alternatively, X could be something like KMnO4 (potassium permanganate). Elements are K, Mn, O. The lightest is K (39), wait no—K is 19 for K? Wait no, wait: K has an atomic number of 19, so its atomic mass is about 39. Mn is about 55. O is 16. So the lightest element is K (39), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 39 +55=94. Not in options.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the reagents. The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include KMnO4, NaOH, H2SO4, etc. Wait, another possibility: X is Na2CO3. Then elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 12+23=35. Oh, that's option A.

Wait, that's 35 as option A. So is that possible? Let's see.

If X is Na2CO3, then the elements present are Na, C, O.

The lightest element is C (atomic mass ~12), the heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 12 +23 = 35. Which is option A.

But wait, what about the isotopes? The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So in Na2CO3, Na is usually Na-23, but perhaps one of the Na is Na-25 (but that's rare; Na is primarily Na-23). Alternatively, the heavier isotope could be in C or O.

Wait, O has isotopes like O-16, O-17, O-18. So if X has a heavier isotope of O, that would fit.

So for the cumulative atomic masses, we're considering the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So C is lighter than Na and O. So the lightest element is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23), so sum 35. That matches option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps X is KCl. Then elements are K (39) and Cl (35.5). So the lightest is Cl (35.5), heaviest K (39). Sum is 35.5 +39=74.5. Not in options.

Alternatively, X is CaCO3. Elements Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum 52. Not an option.

Hmm, but the options include 25, which is low. So maybe X has elements like O and F? Wait, but F is lighter than O.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G upon heating releases B with a melting point close to 277 K. If B is water, then G could be a carbonate. For example, when heated, a carbonate decomposes into CO2 and the oxide. So perhaps G is CuCO3, which upon heating produces CuO and CO2. Then, B would be CO2, but its melting point is way lower than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if B is something like paraffin wax, which has a higher melting point. But then what would G be? Maybe a hydrocarbon.

Wait, but perhaps the gas W is CO, making G a metal carbide. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide that upon heating loses water. For example, if G is Cu(OH)2, heating produces CuO and H2O (B). Then, the melting point of B (H2O) is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. So that's possible.

So in this scenario, X is a carbonate or hydroxide reacting with an acid. Let's see:

If X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. Reaction produces Na2SO4, H2O, CO2. But no precipitate, so that doesn't fit. 

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of Ba(OH)2. Then reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate, NaOH, etc. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like Zn, reacting with a carbonate solution, but that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, Al(OH)3. Reaction with an acid would produce Al^3+ and water. But again, no gas.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's focus on the isotopes. X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), but that's more about hydrogen isotopes.

Alternatively, if X is Cl-35 and Cl-37, but that doesn't directly help.

Wait, going back to the original question: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product is a molecule with two O atoms. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is CH3COOH, the product is NaCH3COO (sodium acetate), which has two O atoms in the acetate ion. So each acetate has two O. So that fits.

So then X is NaOH. Now, what's the reaction of NaOH with a liquid Y?

Wait, NaOH is a strong base. If Y is a carbonate, perhaps, but that would produce CO2. Alternatively, Y could be an acid, but that would produce a salt and water.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is an alcohol. If X is NaOH and Y is an alcohol, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Y could be a ketone. But the reaction of a base with a ketone? Maybe a condensation reaction, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between NaOH and a nitrate salt. For example, NaOH and AgNO3 would produce AgOH precipitate, which decomposes to AgO and water. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfuric acid. Then, the reaction would be neutralization, producing Na2SO4, water, and maybe some gas? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between X (NaOH) and Y (a carbonate) to produce CO2. But then, the precipitate G would have to form. Maybe if Y is a carbonate solution, like Na2CO3, but that's the same as X. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, perhaps a double decomposition occurs. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a metal hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the options and the possible isotopic elements. Earlier, I thought that X could be Na2CO3, and the sum of the lightest (C, ~12) and heaviest (Na, ~23) is 35, which is option A. But another possibility is that X is something with H and O, like H2O, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So the product is a molecule with two O atoms. For example, if X is NaOH, and the acid is H2COOH (formic acid), the product is NaHCOO (sodium formate), which has two O atoms in the formate ion. So that fits.

So if X is NaOH, then the elements present are Na and O and H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 1 +23 =24. Not an option. Hmm.

Wait, but wait—maybe the product has two O atoms, but in the molecule of the product, not per formula unit. For example, the product could be H2O, which has two O atoms? No, H2O has one O. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the product is CO2, which has two O atoms. So the reaction between X and the keto acid produces CO2. That would require that X has a carbon source.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and the keto acid is something that reacts to produce CO2. For example, X is Na2CO3, reacting with a keto acid to produce CO2. So the product is CO2, which has two O atoms. That fits.

In that case, X is Na2CO3. The elements in X are Na, C, O. The lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 35. Which is option A.

But earlier I thought that when Na2CO3 reacts with H2SO4, no precipitate is formed, but maybe Y is a different liquid. For example, if Y is a solution of BaCl2, then the reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate. So X is Na2CO3, Y is BaCl2. Reaction: Na2CO3 + BaCl2 → BaCO3↓ + 2NaCl.

So gas W wouldn't be produced in that case. Hmm.

Wait, but the reaction of Na2CO3 with an acid would produce CO2 gas, but in that case, Y would be the acid. So perhaps Y is H2SO4. Then, the reaction produces Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. But no precipitate is formed because all are soluble. So that doesn't fit the precipitate G.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, Y is a solution of Fe(OH)3. Then, X is Na2CO3. Reaction would produce FeCO3 precipitate, NaOH, and release CO2 gas. But then, the precipitate G is FeCO3, which upon heating would decompose into FeO and CO2. Then, B would be CO2, but its melting point is lower than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Maybe a hydroxide that upon heating loses water. Like Cu(OH)2. Heating produces CuO and H2O. So B is H2O, melting point 273 K, which is close to 277 K.

So putting it all together: X is Na2CO3. Reacts with Y (maybe a hydroxide solution) to produce CO2 gas, a precipitate G (like FeCO3), and perhaps some solution. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into oxide and CO2 (B is CO2, but that doesn't fit the melting point). Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating produces oxide and H2O (B is H2O, which has melting point 273 K, close to 277 K).

But how does this fit with the gas W being CO2? Because CO2 would be produced in the reaction of X (Na2CO3) with an acid. So perhaps Y is a solution of H2SO4, but then no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of CaCl2. Then, X is Na2CO3. Reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate and NaCl. No gas produced in this case, so that doesn't fit W being CO2.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate of another metal. For example, if Y is CaCO3 solution, and X is Na2CO3, reaction might not occur. Not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the right track here. Let's think about the isotopes again. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So one of the elements in X has a heavier isotope. For example, if X is Na2CO3, then the C isotope could be C-13 or C-14, but those are rare. Alternatively, O could have O-18. So the cumulative masses would be based on the lightest and heaviest isotopes present.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So, for each element in X, the lightest and heaviest isotopes are summed. For example, for O, the lightest isotope is O-16 (mass ~16), the heaviest is O-18 (mass ~18). So if X has O, then for each O in the molecule, you sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes.

Wait, no. The question says, "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for each element present in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes for that element. Then, add them for all elements in X.

Wait, for example, if X is Na2CO3, then elements are Na, C, O.

For Na: lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass ~23), heaviest is Na-25 (mass ~25). So sum is 23 +25 =48.

For C: lightest is C-12 (12), heaviest is C-14 (14). Sum 26.

For O: lightest O-16 (16), heaviest O-18 (18). Sum 34.

Now, the cumulative sum for all elements would be 48 (Na) +26 (C) +34 (O) = 108. But the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, perhaps we look at the elements in X, find the lightest element (lowest atomic number) and the heaviest element, then sum their atomic masses.

So in X, for Na2CO3, the lightest element is C (atomic mass ~12), the heaviest is O (16). Wait, no, Na is 23, which is heavier than O (16). So the heaviest is Na (23), the lightest is C (12). Sum 35, which is option A.

That aligns with option A. So perhaps that's the correct approach.

So, putting all together, the answer is 35, option A.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, forms a precipitate G, and upon heating, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO (carbon monoxide) fits this description, as it has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This suggests that W is CO.

2. **Reaction of X with Y**: X reacts with Y to produce CO gas, a precipitate G, and B. If X is Na₂CO₃ (sodium carbonate), it can react with an acid (e.g., H₂SO₄) to produce CO₂ gas, but this does not align with the gas being CO. Alternatively, X could be a carbonate reacting with a hydroxide solution, producing a carbonate hydroxide precipitate and CO.

3. **Precipitate G and B**: Upon heating, G releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B is water (H₂O), as its melting point is 273 K, very close to 277 K. G could be a carbonate hydroxide, which decomposes into an oxide and water upon heating.

4. **Product with Keto Acid**: The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. If X is Na₂CO₃, it could react with a keto acid to produce CO₂, which has 2 oxygen atoms.

5. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For Na₂CO₃, the elements are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is C (atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ~23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 35**: Matches the sum of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X.
   - **B) 25**: Does not align with any plausible elements in X.
   - **C) 31**: Does not match the calculated sum.
   - **D) 29**: Does not match the calculated sum.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, X is Na₂CO₃, and the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X sum to 35. This aligns with option A.

**Answer: A**
