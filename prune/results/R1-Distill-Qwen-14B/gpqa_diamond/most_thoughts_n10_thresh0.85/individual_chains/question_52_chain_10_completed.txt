Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The question is about a star where its effective temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, and how this ratio changes when spots are present. The options are given, and I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes.

First, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 (n2/n1) is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Since the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, I can relate the energy difference between the levels to that wavelength. The energy E is related to the photon's wavelength by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

But wait, the problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region emits according to its local temperature. When the star has spots, part of the surface is cooler, but how does that affect the overall emission line?

Hmm, the star without spots has Teff 6000K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. But wait, the effective temperature is the average, not the actual photospheric temperature. So perhaps each spot has a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000K?

Wait, no. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. So when 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots, the total emitted flux would be the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Flux from a star's surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4. So the total flux would be F_total = (0.6 * F_unspotted) + (0.4 * F_spotted).

Since the star's Teff is 5500K when 40% is spotted, that means the total flux when spotted is σ*(5500)^4.

Wait, but the unspotted star has F_unspotted = σ*(6000)^4. And when 40% is covered, the total F is 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 5500^4.

So let me find T_spot.

Let me write the equation:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = (5500)^4.

I can compute this.

Compute 6000^4: 6e3^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4: 5.5e3^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So 7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 9.150625e14.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5500^4 is about (5.5)^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So substituting:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 5500^4.

Which is 0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15: 0.6 * 1.296 = 0.7776, so 0.7776e15 = 7.776e14.

So:

7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14:

0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T_spot.

Compute T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

I can compute that. Let me think about exponents.

3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 x 10^14.

Take the fourth root:

= (3.4365625)^(1/4) x (10^14)^(1/4).

10^14^(1/4) = 10^(3.5) = 10^3 * 10^0.5 ≈ 1000 * 3.1623 ≈ 3162.3.

Now, 3.4365625^(1/4). Let's approximate.

I know that 3^(1/4) is about 1.316, 4^(1/4) is 1.414. 3.436 is close to 3.435, which is 3.435.

Wait, 3.435 is about equal to (1.36)^4. Let me check:

1.36^4 = (1.36^2)^2 = (1.8496)^2 ≈ 3.420. Hmm, that's close to 3.436. So maybe 1.365^4?

1.365^2 = approx (1.3^2 + 2*1.3*0.065 + 0.065^2) = 1.69 + 0.169 + 0.004225 ≈ 1.863225.

Then 1.863225^2: let's compute that.

1.8^2 =3.24, 0.063225^2 ≈ 0.004, but cross terms: 2*(1.8)(0.063225) ≈ 0.2276. So 3.24 + 0.2276 + 0.004 ≈ 3.4716. Hmm, which is a bit higher than 3.436. So perhaps 1.36^2 is 1.8496, then 1.8496^2 is (approx) 3.420. So 3.420 is less than 3.436. So maybe 1.362^4?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it numerically with logarithms.

But maybe I can just approximate the fourth root as roughly 1.365, since 1.36^4 is about 3.42 and 1.37^4 would be higher (approx 3.47). So maybe T_spot is about 1.365 * 3162.3.

1.365 * 3162.3 ≈ let's compute:

1.3 * 3162.3 = 4110.99.

0.065 * 3162.3 ≈ approx 205.55.

So sum is about 4110 + 205.55 = 4315.55 K. So T_spot is approximately 4315 K.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I could use logarithms for a more precise calculation.

Compute ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14) = approx 1.235 + 32.236 = 33.471.

Divide by 4: 8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ e^8 is 2980.958, e^0.3678 is approx 1.445. So 2980.958 * 1.445 ≈ 4300 K.

So T_spot is approximately 4300 K.

So the spots are at about 4300 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the actual photospheric temperature in the spotted regions is 4300 K, and 6000 K elsewhere.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio in LTE depends on the temperature where the absorption line is formed. If the line forms in the photosphere, then each region (spotted and unspotted) contributes to the observed line profile.

But the observed ratio is a weighted average, depending on the flux contribution from each region. Because the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level, which depends on temperature.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole has a lower effective temperature. But the actual photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions is 6000 K, and in the spotted regions it's 4300 K.

Wait, but in LTE, each region emits according to its own temperature. So the line emission from Ti will come from both regions.

But how does this affect the observed ratio?

The observed ratio is a combination of the two regions.

But when you have a star with spots, the ratio observed would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions' ratios. Because the hotter regions have higher flux per unit area, but the cooler regions are less bright.

Wait, but the star's surface is 40% covered by spots, which are cooler. So each spot area contributes less flux than the surrounding.

Hmm, perhaps the effective temperature is the average, but the line ratios are more influenced by the hotter regions because they emit more flux, which affects the overall line profile.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the individual regions are at 6000 and 4300 K.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is an average of the two regions' ratios, weighted by their emission in the line.

Alternatively, since the line is formed in the photosphere, each region contributes its own level populations to the line. The total line strength would be a sum of the contributions from each region.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. Wait, no, when the star has spots, part of the photosphere is cooler. So the overall ratio (n2/n1) isn't a single value because different parts of the photosphere have different temperatures.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of neutral Ti in levels 1 and 2 decreases. So, when the star isn't spotted, the ratio is higher, and when it is spotted, the ratio is lower.

Wait, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher when T is higher because the exponential term is larger. Because higher T leads to higher exponent, so higher ratio.

So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. So the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio is the average of the two regions' ratios, but each weighted by the area they cover. Or perhaps it's a flux-weighted average.

Wait, in the unspotted star, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K, so the ratio is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ) at 6000 K.

When it's spotted, 60% is at 6000 K, 40% is at 4300 K. But since the flux is proportional to T^4, the flux from each region is:

Flux_unspotted = 0.6 * (6000^4) / (6000^4) )? No, wait, the total flux is 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(4300^4) = 5500^4.

Wait, but each region's contribution to the line depends on the number of atoms in each level.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in a region where the temperature is a mix of the two. But that's probably not the case. Instead, the line is formed in each region at their respective temperatures, and the equivalent width is a sum of the contributions from each region.

But perhaps the ratio is determined by the temperature where the line forms. Wait, if the line forms in a region with a certain temperature, but with spots, the line features a mix of higher and lower temperatures. So the overall ratio isn't a simple average, but depends on the contribution from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average ratio as a function of the effective temperature. But the effective temperature is 5500 K, not the photospheric temperature in the two regions.

Wait, but the question says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the photospheric effective temperature is the Teff, but when the star has spots, the actual photospheric regions have two different temperatures: 6000 K and 4300 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is suggesting that the star's photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that's not correct, because the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures.

But the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K in the spotted case.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The line is formed in the photosphere. So if the photosphere has a lower effective temperature, does the ratio change? Or does each region (spot and non-spot) have its own temperature and thus its own ratio?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio_without_spots) / (ratio_with_spots).

The ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

But wait, in the unspotted case, T is 6000 K. In the spotted case, the photosphere has a lower effective temperature, but the actual T is a mix of 6000 K and 4300 K.

But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again.

The problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But that can't be right, because the spots are cooler and the rest are at 6000 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the star has spots. Because the effective temperature is a measure of the total flux, but the actual photospheric temperature would vary.

But the question seems to imply that the photospheric temperature is lower when spots are present. So the photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted, and 6000 K when not.

If that's the case, then the ratio would be higher when the star is hotter, because the exponential term depends on T.

So the ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ) ).

Wait, ΔE is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1. Since the transition is at 1448 Å, ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck constant, c is speed of light. Let me compute ΔE in terms of k.

The energy E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ ~0.995 * 1e5 = ~99500 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that's an interesting number. So when you have T in denominator, the exponent becomes - (ΔE/(k)) / T = - (1e5 K) / T.

So the ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( - 1e5 / T ).

So, when T is 6000 K, the exponent is -1e5 / 6000 ≈ -16.6667.

When T is 5500 K, exponent is -1e5 /5500 ≈-18.1818.

So, the ratio without spots is proportional to exp(-16.6667), and with spots it's exp(-18.1818).

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than when it has spots.

Which matches this, because the exponent is less negative when T is higher, so the exponential is larger.

So the ratio when not spotted is higher than when spotted.

But wait, the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases (same element, same levels), the ratio depends only on T.

So, the ratio without spots is R1 = exp( -1e5 / 6000 )

With spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so R2 = exp( -1e5 /5500 )

So the factor by which R1 changes compared to R2 is R1/R2 = exp( ( -1e5/6000 ) - (-1e5/5500) ) )

Simplify the exponent:

= exp( 1e5 ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000015151.

Multiply by 1e5: 1e5 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.5151.

So exponent is 1.5151.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151.

Compute e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.0151 is approximately 1.01525.

So 4.4817 * 1.01525 ≈ 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Wait, but does the temperature when the star has spots correspond to 5500 K?

Wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, but the actual photosphere has a mix of 6000 K and 4300 K. So perhaps the actual ratio is a weighted average between the two regions.

But earlier I thought that the ratio would be a flux-weighted average because the emission from each region depends on their flux.

Wait, the line strength depends on the number of atoms in a given state and the contribution to the line from each region. So if a region is cooler, there are fewer atoms in the higher energy level, but that region also contributes less flux because it's cooler.

So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the ratio is (n2/n1). For each region, it's (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

The observed ratio would be a sum of contributions from each region, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalent width of the line depends on the number of transitions, which depends on n2 and n1.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the effective temperature is 5500 K when the star has spots, thus using T_eff for the ratio.

If that's the case, then the ratio without spots is R1 = exp( -1e5 /6000 ), with spots R2 = exp( -1e5 /5500 ), so the factor is R1/R2 = exp( 1e5 (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) = exp( 1e5 * ( (6000 -5500 ) / (5500 *6000) ) ) )

Compute (6000-5500) =500,

Denominator 5500*6000 = 3.3e7.

So 500 / 3.3e7 ≈ 1.51515e-5.

Multiply by 1e5: 1.51515e-5 *1e5 = 1.51515.

So same as before.

Thus, the factor is e^1.51515 ≈4.54.

Which is approximately 4.5, option C.

But wait, earlier I thought the ratio when the star has spots is a mix of 6000 and 4300 K. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the problem is suggesting that the photospheric temperature is 5500 K in both cases, but that's not possible because the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But that's not correct. So this might be a point of confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the average of the two regions. So the observed ratio is a weighted average based on the area covered.

But considering the line strength, which depends on the number of atoms in each level, which depends on the temperature.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The original setup is that when the star has 40% spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. The Teff is the total emission, so the flux is a combination of the unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (4300 K) regions.

But the line ratio depends on the temperature where the line is formed, which is in each region.

So the observed ratio isn't a simple average. Instead, the line is formed in each region, and the total line is a combination of contributions from both regions.

But how do these contributions combine? Each region contributes to the line based on its number of atoms and the excitation ratio in that region.

So the total number of Ti atoms in level 2 is the sum from both regions: n2_total = n2_unspotted + n2_spotted.

Similarly, n1_total = n1_unspotted + n1_spotted.

But the ratio (n2/n1) observed would be (n2_total)/(n1_total). 

But wait, the Ti atoms are neutral, so the total number in each level depends on the temperature of the region.

Let me model this.

Assume the star's surface area is A. 60% of it is at T1=6000 K, 40% at T2=4300 K.

In each region, the ratio of n2/n1 is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The number of Ti atoms in level 2 in the unspotted area: n2_unspotted = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * N_unspotted.

Similarly, n2_spotted = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) * N_spotted.

Same for n1: n1_unspotted = exp(0) * N_unspotted = N_unspotted.

n1_spotted = N_spotted.

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is for the ratio n2/n1. So n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Therefore, the total n2 is n1_unspotted * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) + n1_spotted * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ).

But the total n1 is n1_unspotted + n1_spotted.

So the observed ratio R_obs = [n1_unspotted * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) + n1_spotted * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] / (n1_unspotted + n1_spotted )

But n1_unspotted = (N_unspotted) since n1 is the ground state.

Similarly, n1_spotted = N_spotted.

But N_unspotted is the number of Ti atoms in the unspotted area, and N_spotted is the number in the spotted area.

Since the surface area is A, the number of atoms depends on the area.

Assuming uniform number density, then N_unspotted = N0 * 0.6 A, and N_spotted = N0 * 0.4 A, where N0 is the number density.

So substituting:

n1_unspotted = 0.6 A N0,

n1_spotted = 0.4 A N0,

n2_unspotted = 0.6 A N0 * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)),

n2_spotted = 0.4 A N0 * (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Thus,

R_obs = [ 0.6 A N0 (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) + 0.4 A N0 (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] / [ 0.6 A N0 + 0.4 A N0 ]

Simplify:

A N0 cancels out,

R_obs = (g2/g1) [ 0.6 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) + 0.4 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] / ( (0.6 + 0.4) )

Which simplifies to:

R_obs = (g2/g1) [ 0.6 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) + 0.4 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Because denominator is 1.

Now, when the star has no spots, R_no_spots = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

The factor is R_no_spots / R_obs = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ 0.6 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) + 0.4 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Because g2/g1 is the same in both cases.

So, substituting T1=6000 K and T2=4300 K.

We have:

Factor = exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)) / [ 0.6 exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)) + 0.4 exp(-ΔE/(k * 4300)) ]

Let me compute this.

First, compute the exponent terms.

ΔE/(k) = 1e5 K as before.

So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = exp(-1e5 /6000) = exp(-16.6667) ≈ 1.92e-7.

exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp(-1e5 /4300) ≈ exp(-23.2558) ≈ 1.25e-10.

Compute numerator: 1.92e-7.

Denominator: 0.6 *1.92e-7 + 0.4 *1.25e-10.

Compute each term:

0.6*1.92e-7 = 1.152e-7.

0.4 *1.25e-10 = 5e-11.

So denominator total ≈ 1.152e-7 + 5e-11 ≈ 1.1525e-7.

So factor = (1.92e-7) / (1.1525e-7) ≈ 1.664.

So the factor is approximately 1.66. Hmm, but the options don't have that. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, this is confusing. Earlier, I thought the factor when using Teff of 5500 K was about 4.5, but now with this approach, it's about 1.66.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the factor (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) should be greater than 1.

With this calculation, it's ~1.66, which would be none of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Compute ΔE/(k T1) = 1e5 / 6000 ≈ 16.6667.

exp(-16.6667) ≈ 1.92e-7.

ΔE/(k T2) = 1e5 /4300 ≈ 23.2558.

exp(-23.2558) ≈ let's compute.

We know that exp(-23) is about 1.9e-10. exp(-23.2558)= ?

Let me compute ln(1.25e-10) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 23.2558. Let me compute this.

But perhaps a calculator approach: using e^23 ≈ 1e10, but wait, e^10≈22026, e^20≈4.85e8, e^23≈ 1e10? Let me think:

e^5 ≈148.413,

e^10≈148.413^2≈22026.465,

e^15≈ 22026.465 * 148.413≈ 3.269e6,

e^20≈3.269e6 * 22026≈7.2e10,

e^23= e^20 * e^3 ≈7.2e10 * 20.0855≈1.448e12.

So e^23.2558 ≈ e^23 * e^0.2558 ≈ 1.448e12 * 1.292 ≈ 1.876e12.

So exp(23.2558) ≈1.876e12.

So exp(-23.2558)=1/(1.876e12)≈5.33e-13.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.25e-10. That was incorrect.

So correction: exp(-ΔE/(k T2))=exp(-23.2558)≈5.33e-13.

So, let's redo the denominator:

0.6 *1.92e-7 = 1.152e-7.

0.4 *5.33e-13 ≈2.13e-13.

So denominator = 1.152e-7 + 2.13e-13 ≈1.152e-7 (since 2.13e-13 is negligible compared to 1e-7).

So denominator ≈1.152e-7.

Numerator is 1.92e-7.

So factor = 1.92e-7 / 1.152e-7 = 1.6667.

Hmm, so same as before. So factor is about 1.66.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the problem expects us to consider the effective temperature. Let me think again.

If I use T_eff =5500 K, then the factor would be exp(1e5 (1/5500 -1/6000 )) = exp(1.515) ≈4.54.

Which is option C.

But why is this different from the flux-weighted approach? Because in reality, the line ratio isn't a simple average of the temperatures, but it's a weighted average based on the contribution of each region to the line.

But according to this, the factor would be about 4.5, which is option C.

But why are these two methods giving different results? Because when the spots are present, the line is formed in both the hot and cool regions, leading to a lower ratio than what you'd get by just using the effective temperature.

But the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Maybe the question is implying that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, which isn't accurate but is how the problem is presented.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the effective temperature when calculating the ratio, which would lead to option C.

But I'm not entirely certain. However, given that the options include 4.5, and the calculation using T_eff=5500 K gives that, I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having 40% of its surface covered by cooler spots (resulting in an overall \( T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to units of \( kT \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 10^5 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Ratio Without Spots**: For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \), the ratio is:
   \[
   R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{10^5}{6000}\right) = \exp(-16.6667) \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]

3. **Ratio With Spots**: For \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \), the ratio is:
   \[
   R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{10^5}{5500}\right) = \exp(-18.1818) \approx 1.65 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]

4. **Factor of Change**: The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp(-16.6667)}{\exp(-18.1818)} = \exp\left(18.1818 - 16.6667\right) = \exp(1.5151).
   \]
   Using \( \exp(1.5151) \approx 4.54 \), the factor is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots is approximately **4.5**.
