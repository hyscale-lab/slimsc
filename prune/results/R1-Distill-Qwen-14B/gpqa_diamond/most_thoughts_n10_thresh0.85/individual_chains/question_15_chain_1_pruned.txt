Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about the probability of detecting transiting planets. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right?

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's. So, same size stars but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The transit probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by other factors, but wait, no, I think it's more about the orbital parameters. Oh right, the probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The formula I remember is that the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else?), where a is the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet)/a, but since R_planet is much smaller, we can approximate it as R_star / a.

Wait, no, more accurately, the probability P is given by (R_star / a) * (some factor based on inclination). But since we're considering the maximum possible probability (they've already been detected via RV, which implies they have a certain inclination, but for the purpose of choosing which to observe, we probably consider the prior probability). Oh wait, but for the purpose of this question, are we to assume that the planets have random orientations, so the prior probability is what matters? Because if the researchers are choosing based on their transit probabilities, which are based on orbital geometry.

So the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (something), but wait, the exact formula I think is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (some function), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as (R_star / a). But wait, I might be mixing up the actual formula. Let me think again.

The probability of a transit is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by another factor. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is:

P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^{1/3})) )

Wait, no, maybe that's for the Doppler method's sensitivity. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let's get back. For the transit method, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given by the formula:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * ( (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^{1/3})^{-1} ) )

Wait, no, perhaps the right formula is the one from the transit probability, which is (R_star / a)
