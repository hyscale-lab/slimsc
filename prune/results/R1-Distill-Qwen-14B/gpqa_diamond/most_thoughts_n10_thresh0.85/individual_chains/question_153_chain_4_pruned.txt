Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking nucleophilic positions in another molecule. The problem gives three different reactions, labeled (A), (B), and (C), and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to match them with the options provided.

Let me break down each part separately.

First, Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as reagents. 

What's dimethyl malonate? I think it's a good dienophile in some reactions, but here, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), which is a strong base, I probably need to form an enolate. So, the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate ester. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so it's (CH3COO)2CCH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Dimethyl malonate is actually (CH3COO)2CCH2COOCH3? Or wait, no, more accurately, it's (CH3COO)2CCH2COOCH3? Hmm, no, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)2. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. So, when the base is added, it will deprotonate the alpha hydrogen next to the carbonyl, forming an enolate. The enolate is a strong nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no: wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so the structure should be CH2=CHCO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH
