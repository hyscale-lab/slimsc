Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r^3, r^5, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

But wait, the relationship here is that the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So, N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since r is 1/plx, then substituting r into the equation, N would be proportional to r^5. Because if r =1/plx, then 1/plx is r, so r^5 would be (1/plx)^5, which is the same as 1/plx^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, it's about how the number of stars in each shell of thickness dr increases as r increases, right?

So, if the number of stars is proportional to r^5, does that mean the number per unit volume increases with r^5? Or is there another factor to consider?

Wait, no. Parallax and distance are inversely related, so as parallax decreases, distance increases. So if N varies as 1/plx^5, and since r = 1/plx, that makes N proportional to r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number would increase by r^5.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe I should think in terms of differential number. Like, how many stars are there between r and r + dr. Hmm.

But the question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And since r is 1/plx, then 1/plx is r, so 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number of stars in each shell increases with the fifth power of r. That would imply that each successive shell at higher r contains more stars than the previous, and the rate of increase is steep.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5, which would match. So the number increases as r^5, so the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes when you have something varying with distance, you have to consider factors like the volume. Like, if you're looking at the number density, you have to account for the volume element. But in this question, it's about the number of stars varying in a specific region, so perhaps it's considering the count per unit volume or something else.

Wait, no, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So it's N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since r = 1/plx, then 1/plx = r, so N ∝ r^5.

Wait another thought: When considering the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in that shell is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit volume would be r^5 / (4πr² dr) ) = r^3/(4π dr). But the question isn't asking about the number per unit volume; it's just asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps the question is considering the number in each shell, so the number in each shell is N = k r^5. Because the shell's volume is 4πr² dr, and if the number is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit volume would be r^3, but the question is just about the total number in each shell.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since r is 1/plx, replace 1/plx with r. So 1/plx^5 becomes r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So how does N change with r? It changes as r^5, so the number increases rapidly.

So the correct option is B, which is ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) through the relation \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting \( r \) into the equation, we find \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)). Since the relationship \( N \propto r^5 \) directly describes this dependence, the number of stars increases steeply with distance. The other options (\( r^3 \), \( r^4 \), and \( r^2 \)) do not match the given variation with parallax.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
