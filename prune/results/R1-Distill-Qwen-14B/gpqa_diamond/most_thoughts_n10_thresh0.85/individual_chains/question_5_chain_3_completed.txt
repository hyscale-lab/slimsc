Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. And the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues which are their components along a particular direction. So the operator P here is like a component of angular momentum, perhaps spin?

The problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me write down what each component looks like. 

P_x is ħ/2 times a matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]
So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, these matrices look familiar. Oh right, they're the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is actually the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or a muon. 

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, it must have direction cosines such that the y-component is zero. So the direction vector would be (l, 0, m), where l² + m² = 1. 

The operator P for a direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Since n is (l, 0, m), P = l P_x + m P_z.

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, I'm looking for the eigenvector |+> such that (l P_x + m P_z) |+> = (ħ/2) |+>.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, the operator can be written as (P · n) |+> = (ħ/2) |+>.

Wait, but the eigenvector should satisfy (P · n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So I need to find the eigenvector for the operator (l P_x + m P_z) corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me write out the matrix for (l P_x + m P_z). Since P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], the operator (l P_x + m P_z) would be (ħ/2)( l [[0,1],[1,0]] + m [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

So the matrix becomes:
(ħ/2) * [ [m, l],
           [l, -m] ]

Given that the eigenvalue is ħ/2, I set up the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2) * [ [m, l], [l, -m] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [m, l], [l, -m] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation is:

[ m*a + l*b = a ]
[ l*a - m*b = b ]

Let me rearrange these equations.

First equation: (m)a + l b = a → (m -1) a + l b =0 → (m-1)a = -l b → a = [ -l/(m-1) ] b

Similarly, second equation: l a - m b = b → l a = (m +1) b → a = [ (m +1)/l ] b

So from first equation, a = [ -l/(m-1) ] b
From second equation, a = [ (m+1)/l ] b

Set them equal:

[ -l/(m-1) ] = [ (m+1)/l ]

Multiply both sides by (m-1) l:

- l^2 = (m+1)(m-1)
- l^2 = m^2 -1

But wait, since the direction vector n is (l, 0, m) and lies in the x-z plane, we have l² + m² =1. So m² =1 - l².

Substituting into the equation above:

- l^2 = (1 - l^2) -1 → - l^2 = -l^2 → 0=0. Oh, identity. So the equations are consistent, which makes sense because we're finding an eigenvector.

So, now, let me express a in terms of b. Let's take the second equation:

a = (m+1)/l * b

Now, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ (m+1)/l * b, b ] = b [ (m+1)/l , 1 ]

We can factor out b (non-zero) so the eigenvector is proportional to [ (m+1)/l , 1 ].

But wait, let me think about normalization. The vector should have a magnitude of 1 when normalized.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the polar angle theta would be the angle from the z-axis. So m = cos(theta), and l = sin(theta), because n is (l,0,m) with l^2 + m^2 =1.

So, substituting l = sin(theta), m=cos(theta).

Then, the coefficients become:

a = [ (cos(theta) +1 ) / sin(theta) ] * b

Hmm, let me see. So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cos(theta)+1)/sin(theta), 1 ]

Wait, perhaps I can write this in terms of theta/2 using trigonometric identities.

Because (1 + cos(theta)) = 2 cos^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

(1 + cos(theta)) / sin(theta) = [2 cos^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

So (1 + cos(theta))/sin(theta) = cot(theta/2)

Thus, a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * b , b ]

Which can be written as b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But we can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But to normalize, we need to compute the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is (cot(theta/2))^2 + 1^2.

cot^2 +1 = csc^2, so sqrt(csc^2) is |csc(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi (as it's the polar angle), csc(theta/2) is positive when theta/2 is in (0, pi/2), which it is for theta between 0 and pi.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sin(theta/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by 1/(csc(theta/2)) ) → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2), we get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, let me check:

If the vector is [a, b] = [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)), 1 ] and we normalize it:

The norm is sqrt( (cos^2/(sin^2)) + 1 ) = sqrt( (cos^2 + sin^2)/ sin^2 ) ) = sqrt(1/sin^2) ) = 1/sin(theta/2)

So the normalized vector is [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the question states that the operator is for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so the spin state is being considered here.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is similar but not the same as what we've derived.

Option D has terms with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which suggests specific direction, but our solution is general, based on theta.

Option A has hbar in the components, but eigenvectors are dimensionless. So probably option C or D is the answer.

Wait, but in our derivation, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. But wait, I should also remember that the sign could matter. The spin-up state along a direction n is typically written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]. But in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) is zero. So e^{i phi} is 1. So the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which aligns with option C.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But what about the options in the question? Let me look again.

The question says, what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? So let's see the options:

A) (√(2/3)ℏ, √(1/3)ℏ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cosθ/2, sinθ/2)
D) (√(2/3)ℏ cosθ/2, √(1/3)ℏ sinθ/2)

Wait, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). That would be the case if the direction was along a specific axis, like (l,0,m) where l^2 + m^2 =1, perhaps with specific l and m values. But the problem states that the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So option C is the general case, while D is a specific case.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't give specific values for l and m, only that n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the answer must be option C. Because the others either have specific coefficients (like A and D) or have a phi term (B), which isn't applicable here because n is in x-z (phi=0).

Wait, but let me think again. The general eigenvector for spin-1/2 in direction n is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in this problem, phi is zero because n is in x-z plane (so azimuthal angle phi is zero). So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

But looking again, the problem says "the operator P" along an arbitrary direction n. So the eigenvector depends on theta and phi. But since n is in x-z, phi is zero.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct option is C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The eigenvector is determined by solving the eigenvalue equation for the operator $P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane with components $(l, 0, m)$ such that $l^2 + m^2 = 1$.

The operator $P$ is expressed as $P = l P_x + m P_z$, and the eigenvalue equation is solved to find the eigenvector. After simplification, the eigenvector is proportional to $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. This result is consistent with the general form of the spin-up state for a spin-1/2 particle along an arbitrary direction.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Includes $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, implying $\phi = 0$.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ and is consistent with the problem's conditions.
- **Option D**: Includes specific coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not general and depend on a specific direction, not an arbitrary one.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it represents the normalized eigenvector for the given conditions.

Answer: C
