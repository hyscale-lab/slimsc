Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand the problem. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, the reaction should produce the acetate ion and water. The equivalence point is where the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, but before that, the solution is diluted. So, I should calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the concentration after dilution is (M1V1)/(V1+V2) = (0.05 * 20)/(40) = (1)/(40) M? Wait, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ is 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L), the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So, M2 = (M1 * V1) / (V1 + V2) = (0.05 *
