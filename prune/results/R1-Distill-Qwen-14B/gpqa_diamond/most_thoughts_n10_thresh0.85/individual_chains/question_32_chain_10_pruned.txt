Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium has 3 protons normally, right? If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So I need to find the energy per nucleon or per the entire nucleus?

Wait, wait, wait. The problem says the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So I think we're dealing with relativistic speeds here. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I should figure out the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is something I might need. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass using the atomic number and the number of neutrons. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact mass of Li-6. Maybe I can approximate it using the mass of a proton and neutron. 

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Maybe I should recall that the mass of a nucleus can be estimated using the sum of the masses of individual protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know the mass of Li-6, or maybe it's given as a standard value. Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide any masses, so I must think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the energy using the relativistic kinetic energy formula. The total energy is gamma times the rest energy, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest energy. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which would relate to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus.

Wait, but let me make sure. In particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's quoted, but sometimes the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass energy) is considered. I think in this case, since it's a heavy ion collider, the energy per ion is typically the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, let me recall. The total energy E of a particle is gamma * m * c². And the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) * m * c². So if the question is about the energy of the collider, I think it's referring to the kinetic energy because the rest mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy at such high speeds. But wait, for heavy ions, the rest mass is actually significant. So perhaps the total energy is what's needed.

Wait, but the first thing I need to do is find the gamma factor when the speed is 0.96c. Let's compute gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.
