Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). 

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance, right? Like, the same number per cubic parsec everywhere. But how does that translate when we look at parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Let me think about the volume involved here.

At a certain distance d, which corresponds to parallax plx, the volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)πd³. But wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume, right? So number of stars N is proportional to d³. 

But since plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So substituting that in, N is proportional to (1/plx)³. But wait, no, because we're talking about the number per unit parallax. Oh wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So like, if I take a small change in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Wait, maybe I should approach this with differential calculus. Let's say the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between distances d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx. Oh wait, wait. Let me get the exact relationship.

Parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The differential distance dd is the change in distance when plx changes by dplx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's because d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/plx², so dplx = - plx² dd. Hmm, maybe.

But let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dd at distance d. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant, say n. So number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd. 

But how does this relate to plx? Since d = 1/plx, dd = -d² dplx. Wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Therefore, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² times dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = (1/(plx)^2) dplx (taking absolute value since number can't be negative), so the number becomes proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, that would be (1/plx^4) dplx. 

Wait, but wait—no, perhaps I'm mixing variables here. Let me try to model this correctly. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the shells of radii d and d + dd. So the number of stars in the shell is 4π d² (n) dd, where n is the number density. But since we're considering a differential range, we can write:

dN = 4π d² n dd.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. So substituting,

dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 n * (1/(plx)^2) dplx )

So, dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So dN/dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number per unit plx (like per parsec of plx) goes down as 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of volume per unit parallax. Another approach: The volume of a sphere of radius d is (4/3)πd³. So the number of stars within distance d is N = n * (4/3)πd³. But d = 1/plx, so N = n*(4/3)π (1/plx)^3. So the number of stars up to a certain parallax is inversely proportional to plx³. 

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the differential number, dN, would be the change
