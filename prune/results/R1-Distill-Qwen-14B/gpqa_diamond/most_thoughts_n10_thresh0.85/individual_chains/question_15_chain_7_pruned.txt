Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. Their orbital periods are differentâ€”Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, right? Because, like, closer planets orbit faster.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, same radius but different masses? Oh, because stars can have different masses but similar sizes if they're in different stages. Like, maybe Planet_2's star is a slightly evolved subgiant or something, but same size.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. More specifically, the probability P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms. Oh right, the transit probability also depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I recall is P = (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s), where R_s is the star's radius. So that simplifies to (R_p * R_s) / (a * R_s) )? Wait, no, maybe it's more like (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2 - R_s^2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2 when a >> R_s, which I think is usually the case.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But without knowing the inclination, we can't determine that. But the RV method already gives some information because it detects the Doppler shift which depends on the mass and the inclination. Oh wait, no, RV method gives a minimum mass since it depends on sin(i), where i is the inclination. But for our
