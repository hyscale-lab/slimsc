Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down. Okay, the question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, right, so the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo, maybe. Oh wait, probably it's written as L(y) = -λ (f ψ_f-bar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y)), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term. Oh right, Yukawa interactions typically look like ψ† ψ multiplied by a scalar, something like that. So in this case, the interaction term would be something like λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f. So that would imply that the boson X couples to fermions f.

So the decay of X would be into fermion-antifermion pairs. Since the boson is a scalar, its decay products must be a fermion and an antifermion. So X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle if the energy is sufficient.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check whether the sum of the fermion masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because if the mass of the fermion times 2 is more than 6 GeV, then that decay channel is not allowed kinematically.

Wait, but for some fermions, like quarks, their masses are not as straightforward because they're inside hadrons and the masses come from binding energy. Oh, but wait, for decay purposes, the rest mass of the fermion is what matters. For the purpose of decay, the rest mass is the actual mass of the particle. So for quarks, the current masses are typically used. Let me recall the approximate masses of the quarks.

The up and down quarks are the lightest, around 2-5 MeV each. The strange quark is about 100 MeV, the charm quark around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, and top is way too heavy at about 173 GeV. For leptons, the electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon 0.1 GeV, tau around 1.77 GeV. 

Wait, but wait. The coupling is given for fermions f and ψ_f. So which fermions are these? The Lagrangian says f and ψ_f. Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's like f is a lepton and ψ_f a quark, or perhaps it's a typo and perhaps it's the same fermion. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify, but the question is about allowed decays, so perhaps the interaction is with all the fermions f.

Wait, the interaction term is probably \lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f (y). So that would imply that the coupling is to a single type of fermion. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense, because then X would only decay into that fermion. But the answer options have multiple decay channels. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I should think that the interaction is with all possible fermions, so the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, subject to the mass constraints.

Wait, the problem statement says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So, looking at the structure, the interaction term is perhaps something like \lambda \bar{\psi}_f (y) X(y) \psi_f (y). So that's a Yukawa coupling between X and the fermion ψ_f. So for each fermion f, X can decay into ψ_f and anti-ψ_f.

So the possible decay products are any fermion f and anti-f, provided that twice the mass of f is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermions:

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Leptons: electron, muon, tau, and their antiparticles.

Top quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so no decay into top. Similarly, tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 2*1.77 is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be a decay product. Let me see each fermion:

Electron: mass ~0.5 MeV. 2*0.5 is negligible, so yes.

Muon: ~0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 GeV <6 GeV.

Tau: ~1.77 GeV. 2*1.77=3.54 GeV <6 GeV.

So leptons are allowed: e, mu, tau.

Quarks:

Up: 2-5 MeV. 2*up ~10 MeV <6 GeV: allowed.

Down: similar to up.

Strange: ~100 MeV. 2*100 is 200 MeV <6 GeV: allowed.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 = 3 GeV <6 GeV: allowed.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV. 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV: not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar because 9>6.

Top: way too heavy, so no.

So the possible quark decays are u, d, s, c. So X → uū, dđ, sŝ, cccounter.

Wait, but the options don't have all of them. Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, bottom would require 9 GeV, which we can't do. So option A includes b, which is invalid.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes c, which is allowed (3 GeV <6). So yes, that's possible.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible, so no.

Option D includes b, which is no. So only option B and D have tau, mu, e, and some quarks.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e.

But X's mass is 6 GeV, so decay into b's would require 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Each of these fermions has mass less than 3 GeV, so 2*3=6 GeV is the limit.

Charm is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV <6, allowed.

So for each fermion in option B, 2m_f <=6 GeV.

So decay into c cbar is allowed, as 3 GeV.

Similarly, tau is allowed as 3.54 GeV.

Option B includes c cbar, which is allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's 2mc=3 GeV; 2ms=0.2 GeV; 2mu=0.0002 GeV; 2md=0.0002 GeV; 2mtau=3.54 GeV. All of which are below 6 GeV.

So all these decay channels are allowed.

Option C includes t tbar, which is 346 GeV, way too heavy, so no.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether X can decay into any of these. I think that if the coupling is allowed, then the decay is possible. So the interaction term is given as -λ f f-bar X, so the coupling is between X and fermion f. So all the fermions f for which the coupling exists and 2m_f <=6 GeV are allowed.

But the problem is, the given Lagrangian: the interaction is written as -λ f (psi_f bar) (upsilon + X) psi_f.

Wait, perhaps that's the Yukawa term. So probably, the interaction is with a single fermion type. Because in the term, it's f (psi_f bar) (upsilon+X) psi_f. So f is a field, and psi_f is another field? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f (y). So that would be a Yukawa coupling term, where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the coupling is between X and ψ_f. So X can decay into ψ_f and anti-ψ_f. So the possible decay products are ψ_f and anti-ψ_f, provided that their mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but in that case, the Lagrangian would only couple X to one specific fermion. So for example, if ψ_f is the electron, then X can only decay into e+ e-.

But the options have multiple decay channels, which suggests that X can decay into multiple fermion pairs. So perhaps the problem is that the interaction is such that X can decay into any of the possible fermions, each with their own couplings.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f (y). So perhaps the term is f which is the field for the fermion, and ψ_f is another field? Hmm, perhaps that's a typo or notation confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the term is simplified, implying that X couples to all fermions, so each fermion can be a decay product.

Alternatively, perhaps the theory includes multiple fermions, all of which couple to X. So in that case, all fermion pairs with 2m_f ≤6 GeV are possible decay channels.

So for each possible fermion f, if 2m_f ≤6 GeV, then X can decay into f and f-bar.

So the allowed fermions are:

u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But not b or t.

So looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So Option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All have 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So this is possible.

Option C includes t, which is too heavy, so no.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy, so it's incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must be a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the total rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the fermion masses must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the energy of the system is sufficient for the decay.

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Quarks**: 
     - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s = 200 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
     - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - **Leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
   - \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
