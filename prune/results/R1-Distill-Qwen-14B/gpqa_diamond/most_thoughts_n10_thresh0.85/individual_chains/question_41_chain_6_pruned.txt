Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light in different media and motion, I have to consider both the properties of the medium (like the index of refraction) and the motion of the source or medium relative to the observer. I think this might involve special relativity principles because we're dealing with velocities and the speed of light.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass, which itself is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light as measured from the lab frame.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The usual Galilean addition v' = v + u doesn't apply when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Instead, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh, right! So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light measured in any inertial frame should be c. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium, like glass?

Ah, the index of refraction n comes into play. The speed of light in the medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. So when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

So this is a problem where the medium (glass) is moving relative to the observer. The light is inside the glass, so its speed in the glass's rest frame is v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So I need to account for the relative motion.

Wait, but the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light is moving through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the light's velocity relative to the lab would depend on both the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, no
