Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are given, and we know that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But here, the medium itself is moving, which complicates things. Oh right, this must involve some sort of relativistic addition, maybe? Because the glass is moving, and the light is in the glass, so maybe the speed isn't just v = c/n as usual.

Wait, but relativity... Let me think. If the medium is moving, does that affect how we measure the speed of light in it? I think in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Like, if you have something moving at velocity u in one frame, and you switch frames moving at velocity v, the new u' isn't simply u + v. Instead, you have to use the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's for when u is the velocity of an object in one frame, and you're moving at velocity v relative to that frame.

But in this case, the medium is moving, and the light is within that medium. So, the speed of light in the medium's rest frame is c/n. But from the lab frame, where the medium is moving, what's the observed speed?

Hmm, maybe I should model this. Let's denote the speed of the light in the glass as u in its own rest frame, which would be u = c/n. Since c is 1 here, u is 1/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. Wait, but how does the motion of the medium affect the light's speed? I think that in the lab frame, the light's speed would be different because the medium is moving towards the observer. So maybe we need to apply the velocity addition formula here.

Wait, no, the velocity addition formula is for adding velocities between different frames. So, the lab frame sees the medium moving at v. The light's velocity in the medium's frame is u = c/n. So, to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's velocity, we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait a second, but the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion. So, in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n. Then, in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v (because the medium is moving at +v in the lab's frame), the light's velocity would be u' = (u + v_medium) / (1 + (u * v_medium)/c²).

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The medium is moving at v in the lab frame. The light is moving at u = 1/n in the medium's frame. So, from the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Wait, but is that correct? Because the velocity addition
