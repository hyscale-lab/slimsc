Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c times S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right?

Wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down. S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, but Pauli matrices usually have different structures. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So then, the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me remember how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So first, let's write down Ay. Since σy is the Pauli Y matrix, Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0  (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i   (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0       ]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So Ay - a I is:

[ -a      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -a      ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)))] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (h²
