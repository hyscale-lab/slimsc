Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D, with percentages ranging from about 17% to 42%.

Hmm, stability constants. I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

So, the complexes are probably different forms of Co with varying numbers of SCN- ligands. The question mentions dithiocyanato complexes, which I believe means complexes with two SCN- ions. So, the blue ones are likely the Co with two SCN- attached.

Wait, I think the different β values correspond to different complexes. For instance, β1 might be for the Co(SCN) complex with one SCN, β2 for two, and so on. But wait, the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's four complexes. So the possible complexes could be [Co(SCN)]^x, [Co(SCN)_2]^y, etc. But wait, what's the order? Like, which β corresponds to which complex.

Wait, stability constants typically increase with more ligands if each new ligand adds more stability. But looking at the βs, β3=63 is the highest, then β2=40, β1=9, and β4=16. Wait, that's confusing because β4 is 16, which is lower than β1. So maybe the complexes go up to four SCN- ligands? But the ordering of βs is β3>β2>β4>β1.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible complexes and their formation orders. Let's think: the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4. Each β represents the formation from the previous complex.

Wait, the formation of a complex can be considered in steps. For example, the first complex [CoSCN]^2+ would have β1, the second step forms [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ with β2, and so on. So the overall β for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the formation is stepwise; each β is the stepwise stability constant for adding each SCN-.

Wait, no. The overall stability constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^m from the previous complex is the product of all the stepwise βs up to that point. So for the first complex, it's β1. For the second, it's β1 * β2. For the third, β1 * β2 * β3, and for the fourth, β1
