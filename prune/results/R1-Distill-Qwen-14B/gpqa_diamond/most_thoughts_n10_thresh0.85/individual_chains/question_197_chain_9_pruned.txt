Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hinsberg reaction, which helps determine if a compound is an amine, amide, or something else. But wait, is that the right reaction here? Alternatively, red phosphorus can be involved in other reactions too, like maybe the Wittig reaction? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

But first, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an -OH stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe an amine (N-H stretch). But 3400-2500 is a broad range, which is more characteristic of an -OH group. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 might correspond to aromatic C=C stretches. So, a possible structure is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and maybe an -OH.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak. Could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's -OH proton is also around that region, but they're usually broad. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic -OH? No, aromatic protons are usually lower. Wait, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenol, but phenols are around 5-7 ppm. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent proton like a ketone's alpha proton? No, those are lower. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But the integration is 1H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a formate ester or something else. Wait, but the NMR shows a broad singlet. Oh, wait! Maybe it's an -OH group from a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm might be the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. That makes sense because carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and broad due to hydrogen bonding.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like para-substituted aromatic protons. If it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, each set of protons would be a doublet. So, perhaps two substituents on the ring, in para positions. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe one substituent with two protons each in adjacent positions. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other, so the protons are in two sets of doublets. Like in para-xylene, but that's two methyl groups. But in this case, the substituents are different. So maybe the benzene has two substituents in the para positions, each with an additional group.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The downfield shift suggests de-shielding, so maybe electron-withdrawing groups. If it's a benzene ring with two substituents (like a substituent at para position to another), but wait, no, the two substituents would each have their own effect.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents at the 1 and 4 positions, each being a carbonyl group. No, that might complicate things. Or maybe one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, and another is an electron-donating group.

But let's think about the rest of the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene or methine group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another set of adjacent CH2 groups, maybe part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three hydrogens, like a CH(CH3)2 group or a CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, the d is for doublet? Wait, no, the 1.4 is a doublet? Wait, the notation is (d, 3H) so maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH, like a branching point. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting it all together, maybe there's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's break it down.

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So, perhaps each substituent has two protons. Wait, maybe each substituent is a CH2 group, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is an -OH or something else. Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or acid) and an alkyl group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR substituents. The downfield peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest that the ring has electron-withdrawing groups. A carbonyl group, like a ketone, would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear downfield.

So perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alkoxy group, but wait, that doesn't seem to fit with the other peaks.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, that's probably a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it was an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740 or so, but 1720 is a bit lower, so maybe a ketone or an acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad -OH peak around 10 ppm. So, perhaps a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me go through each part again.

Looking at the 1H NMR, we have:

- 10.5: probably the -OH of a carboxylic acid (broad, singlet, 1H).
- 8.0 ppm, d (2H): perhaps the protons ortho to a carbonyl group. For example, in a para-substituted benzene where one substituent is a carbonyl, like a para-acyl group. Wait, but in that case, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, two protons as a doublet at 8.0 ppm. Then, the other two protons (meta to the substituent) might be at 7.2 ppm, also as a doublet. That would fit a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (like a benzoic acid).

But wait, the question says the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, what reaction is that? Oh, wait, I think that's the Hinsberg reaction. The Hinsberg reaction is used to determine whether an organic compound is an amine, amide, or something else. But wait, in this case, the compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Let me recall. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg test. In this reaction, primary amines react with HI to form N-substituted amides, which then react with red phosphorus to form a phosphazinum salt. Secondary amines form N-substituted phosphazinum salts directly. Tertiary amines don't react because they can't form the phosphazinum salt.

Wait, but if Compound X has a carbonyl group and an amine, perhaps it's an amide. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzamide. So, if Compound X is an amide, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would give a phosphazinum salt. But wait, the options given don't seem to involve amines. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, all the options are either benzoic acids or substituted toluene derivatives. So, perhaps the reaction is something else. Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydration or a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation? No, that's with red phosphorus and a base, I think.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's the hydroamination reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Compound X is an ester, which upon treatment with HI could undergo some kind of cleavage.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me first try to figure out what Compound X is.

So, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm in NMR suggests a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic region indicates a para-substituted benzene. So, one substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and another is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the integration of the aromatic protons is 2H each, so four aromatic protons in total, meaning two substituents on the benzene ring. If it's para-substituted, then there's one substituent at position 1 and another at position 4. Wait, but each substituent would have their own effect on the ring.

Wait, another thing: the IR also shows a peak around 1450 cm-1, which is typical for aromatic C-H bending. So that's consistent with a benzene ring.

So, the structure could be something like a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent, maybe an
