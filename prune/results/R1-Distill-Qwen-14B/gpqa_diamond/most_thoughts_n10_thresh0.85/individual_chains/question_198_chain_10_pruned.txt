Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let me see. Alright, let's break it down.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, so each β is the stability constant for the corresponding complex.

I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^(2+), β3 for Co(SCN)_3^(3+), and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^(4-). But wait, wait. Oh, no, actually, I think βn is the constant for the nth complex. So, β1 would be [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]), right?

So, the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^(2+) complex, which is the second one. So, we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] relative to all cobalt species.

But wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato." I'm a bit confused because I thought that different complexes have different colors, but dithiocyanato might refer to a specific one, possibly the hexaaqua versus others. But the problem specifically says it's about the dithiocyanato, so probably the [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] complex. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- attached. So, the second complex.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the colors. I think the hexaaqua ion is pink, and the thiocyanato complexes are blue, but I'm not certain. Anyway, the problem states that the blue dithiocyanato complexes are what we're after, so the [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] species.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the percentage of the blue complexes, which are the dithiocyanato ones, which I think are the [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] and [Co(SCN)_3^(3+)] complexes. Wait, because I thought that the [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] is blue and [Co(SCN)_3^(3+)] is green or something else. Hmm, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, I should focus on the problem. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue complexes among all. But perhaps the "blue dithiocyanato" refers specifically to the [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)] complex. Or maybe the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN groups. Wait, the term "dithiocyanato" would imply two SCN ligands, correct? So it's the second complex. Ok, so we
