Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is asking me to identify compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are hints provided, and some options to choose from. I'll need to figure out each step carefully.

Let me read the question again. The reaction scheme is as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Additionally, there are two hints:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four ketones, so E must be a ketone. Let's think about each step.

First, let's think about each reaction:

1. A + HCN → B: HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait—HCN adds to carbonyls in a way that forms a cyanohydrin. So A must be a ketone because aldehydes are less likely in this context (but possible). The product B would then be a cyanohydrin—so a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Wait, but wait: HCN can also react with esters or maybe other carbonyl groups. Hmm. Alternatively, if A is a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would form a bicyclic structure? Not sure yet.

2. B → C upon reduction with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), reducing it would convert the nitrile to an amine. Wait, but H2 with Pd usually reduces nitriles to amines. Wait, no, wait: nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically become amines. Wait, but wait, another possibility: sometimes with H2 and different conditions, like Lindlar catalyst, it might hydrogenate double bonds. But B is the product of A + HCN, which is a cyanohydrin. So B would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So perhaps the nitrile group is converted to an amine when H2 and Pd is used. So B: R-OH and R-CN; upon reduction, R-CN becomes R-CH2NH2? No, wait. Wait, in the case of cyanohydrin, the structure is R-O-C≡N. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin would have an -OH and a -CN on adjacent carbons. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, the cyanohydrin would be something like cyclopentane-
