Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. Then, they're asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same signal. Interesting.

First, I need to understand what the problem is saying. So, there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness changes. But the twist is that this can resemble an exoplanet's effect on the light curve. So, what's the radius of such a planet compared to the star?

Wait, the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation. So, the observed variation is due to spots, and we want to find the planet radius that would mimic that.

I remember that the brightness variation (the depth in the light curve) depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. For a planet, the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_s^2. So, the fractional depth is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but spots. So, the spots would cause the star to appear dimmer when they're in view. However, because the star is rotating, the spots come and go, so the brightness varies as the star spins. But the problem is saying that this setup can mimic a planet, so the amplitude of the brightness change is similar to what a planet would cause.

So, the first thing I should figure out is the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the brightness? Spots are cooler regions, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness we observe decreases. The total brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Let me think about the star's total luminosity when spots are present. The star's luminosity without spots would be L = 4π R_s^2 σ T_eff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, the star's radius is R_s, and one hemisphere is covered, so the area of one hemisphere is 2π R_s^2. So, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R_s^2 = 0.4 π R_s^2.

Each spot has a temperature of T_eff - 1000K, which is 5000K.

So, the total luminosity when the spots are facing us is the normal luminosity minus the spots' contribution plus their lower contribution.

Wait, no. The star's luminosity is the sum of all the surface areas emitting. So, the unspotted area emits at 6000K, and the spotted area emits at 5000K.

So, the total luminosity L
