Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and another substance B. Some clues about these substances are given, and I need to figure out what X is, and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, let's break down the information piece by piece.

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has at least two different isotopes, but one is heavier than the usual. This suggests that X is an element that commonly has isotopes, like chlorine or maybe something else. Wait, but because the problem mentions the isotopes' cumulative mass, I need to think about elements with multiple isotopes, maybe with higher atomic numbers.

2. **Reaction with Liquid Y**: Violent reaction. Hmm, what reactions are violent? Maybe metals reacting with acids, but liquid Y's identity is unclear. Alternatively, considering the gas W that's released.

3. **Gas W**: Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think. The simplest gas could be H2O (but no, H and O don't have the same number). Wait, perhaps something like CO2? No, but wait: the molecule could be something like CH4, but CH4 would have 6 protons and 8 neutrons (if considering C-12 and H isotopes). Wait, no, no. Let me think. Maybe it's something like O2? Oxygen molecule has 8 protons each, but each molecule has 16 electrons. Wait, no, the molecule's composition. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO2? Wait, CO2 has a molecule where each carbon has 6 protons, each oxygen has 8. But the total number of protons and neutrons would depend on the isotope.

Wait, no. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, perhaps it's H2O? Let's see: each H has 1 proton, each O has 8. So for H2O, protons are 2 (from H) + 8 (O) = 10. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons (if it's O-16), so 8. But 2 H's have 0 neutrons each (assuming they're protium). So total neutrons in H2O would be 8. But protons are 10. So no, that's not equal.

Another option: NH3? No. Maybe CO? Let's see: CO has a molecule with C (6 protons) and O (8). Protons: 6+8=14. Neutrons: C has 6 in C-12, O has 8 in O-16. So 6+8=14. So total neutrons would be 14, same as protons. So CO has protons 14 (each molecule has 14), and neutrons 14 (6 from C and 8 from O). So that works. Or maybe it's another molecule like that.

Wait, but the molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, each molecule's protons would be the sum of protons in each atom, and similarly for neutrons. So for a molecule of W, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Another example: CH4. Each molecule has C (6 protons) and 4 H (each 1). So total protons: 10. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), so 6. Plus 4 H with 0 neutrons. So total neutrons 6. 10 protons vs 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's something like O2. Each O has 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons. O-16 has 8 neutrons each. So O2 has 16 neutrons in total. So 16 protons, 16 neutrons. Oh wait, but
