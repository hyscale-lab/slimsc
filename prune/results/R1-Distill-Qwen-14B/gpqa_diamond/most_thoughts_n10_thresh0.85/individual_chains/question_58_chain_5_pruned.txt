Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's see. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. 

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, I remember from my studies that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. Regularization helps make these calculations finite so that we can handle them properly. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have properties that prevent such divergences.

So, the question is which of these theories never requires regularization. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electromagnetism in the classical sense, right? Maxwell's equations and all that. But wait, isn't classical electrodynamics a non-quantum theory? And in non-quantum theories, do they have issues with divergences? I thought that in classical E&M, even though there are point charges and such, the theory itself doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. So maybe classical ED doesn't need regularization? Or does it? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same kinds of divergences in the same way. Or do they? Hmm. Wait, maybe in classical electromagnetism, things like the infinite charge density at a point for a point charge can cause problems, but those are more like mathematical singularities rather than the kinds of divergences that regularization addresses in quantum theories. So perhaps classical ED doesn't require regularization in the same sense. Or maybe the answer is D, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory, so it definitely deals with divergences. I remember that QED requires regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. These need to be handled with techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. Without regularization, the calculations are meaningless. So QED does require regularization, so option C is out.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, similar to QED. So it's got the same issues with divergences. In fact, QCD is non-abelian and has things like confinement, but regardless, it still requires regularization in loop calculations. So B is not the correct answer.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. String theories in general aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum field theories. Wait, because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings with extended dimensions, not point particles. So when you compute loop diagrams in string theory, the divergences that occur are softer, maybe leading to finite results. Or perhaps they don't occur at all because the underlying theory is different. So superstring theory might not require regularization because it's designed to be a finite theory. But wait, I
