Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Each particle can move along the x-axis in a tube, and when they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 to x=3. So I think this is a probability problem, where the wave function's square gives the probability density.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex number, right? So this makes sense because of the 'i' term. But when calculating probabilities, I think we take the absolute square of the wave function. Oh right, the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function.

But wait, the wave function here is given as a function of x, but the problem says that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Or does it? Wait no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero outside, but the probability is zero beyond x<1 and x>3. So the wave function could be non-zero outside, but the modulus squared would be zero there. But how?

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the wave function's modulus squared is the probability density. If the probability of finding the particle outside [1,3] is zero, that means the integral of |ψ(x)|² from -infinity to 1 and from 3 to infinity must be zero. So the wave function must be zero
