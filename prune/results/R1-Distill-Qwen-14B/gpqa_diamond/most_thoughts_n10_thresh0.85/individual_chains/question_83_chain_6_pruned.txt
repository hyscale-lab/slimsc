Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read it again. We start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. 

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When I add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C2) can be found using the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2.

Plugging in the numbers: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = C2 * 40 cm³. So C2 is (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH has been added, and then determine the pH based on that.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution first.

The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of these moles have reacted with NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. 

So, the moles remaining of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, when we add NaOH, it's a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. So each mole of NaOH provides a mole of OH^- and a mole of Na^+.

So, after the reaction at 25% titration, the solution will have both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. That means it's a buffer solution, and I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the right ratio. Because the moles of acetate are 0.00025, and the moles of acetic acid are 0.00075. But let's not forget, the total volume has also increased due to the added NaOH. Hmm, but since the volume is the same as the initial diluted solution plus the added NaOH? Or is the volume change negligible here? Hmm, as the question is phrased, it says "at 25% titration," but it doesn't specify whether the volume is being considered. Maybe the volumes are too small compared to the amount of solution to make a significant difference, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the volume is approximately the same as the initial solution, or that the
