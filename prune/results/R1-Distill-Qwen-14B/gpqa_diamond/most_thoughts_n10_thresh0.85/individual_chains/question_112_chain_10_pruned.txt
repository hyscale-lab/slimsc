Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The first part is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix elements are given by Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then I also need to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The matrix representation of the operator has elements where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. That makes me think about what operator this could be. Hmm. Since up and down are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator S_z, the operator whose matrix has off-diagonal elements might be related to S_x or S_y, which have such structures. Wait, S_x and S_y have off-diagonal terms, but let me think. The standard Pauli matrices have 1s or i's in the off-diagonal. Oh wait, but here the operator has ħ/2 in the off-diagonal. Oh right, because the spin matrices are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So for example, S_x = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]], S_y = ħ/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]], and S_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

So the operator described here must be S_x or S_y. Because the matrix elements Aij are zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let me check:

The S_x matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so A12 = A21 = ħ/2. So yes, the operator is S_x. Because Aij is ħ/2 when i≠j, which matches S_x.

Wait, but the operator in the question is A. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of S_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So when the question says "eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A", those are the eigenstates of S_x, so the possible outcomes when measuring in the S_x basis.

But wait, to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate, I think I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>), and then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation values and average, but let's proceed step by step.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>, because the problem says it's proportional to that expression. So let's write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, and find its normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's compute that.

Compute |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no, because (1+i) is a complex number. The modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. (1+i) → real part 1, imaginary part 1. So |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2.

Similarly, (2 - i): real part 2, imaginary part -1. So |2 -i|² = 2² + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Hence, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator A is S_x, whose eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. The eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The eigenstates of S_x are given by:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The eigenstates of S_x are the states where S_x |+x> = (ħ/2)|+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

The standard eigenstates for S_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2),

Wait, no, because when you apply S_x to |+x>, you get (ħ/2) |+x> as the eigenvalue. Let me confirm.

Wait, S_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you multiply S_x by |+x>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the result is (ħ/2)( |down> + |up> )/sqrt(2) ) = (ħ/2)( |+x> ), so yes, that works.

So, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: the eigenstates can be written as |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/
