Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right, because in special relativity, you can't just add velocities normally.

The problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, first, I think I need to find the relative velocity between them. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the relative velocity isn't just the difference between the two speeds because they're moving in the same direction. If they were moving in opposite directions, it would be different. But since both are moving in the same direction, I guess I have to compute how much faster one is than the other from the perspective of the other. Or wait, perhaps from the perspective of an observer in the same frame.

Wait, no, wait. The question asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So, I probably need to compute the velocity of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. Because each astronaut is in their own inertial frame, so relative velocity is how fast one is moving from the other's perspective.

Wait, but how do you compute that? Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, let me get that right. So when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference divided by that factor.

Let me think. The formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the faster object and v is the slower one. So, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5
