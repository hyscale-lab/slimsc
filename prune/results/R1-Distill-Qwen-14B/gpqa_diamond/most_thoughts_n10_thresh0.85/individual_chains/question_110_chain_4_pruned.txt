Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll need to think through each step carefully.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The key here is to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by each of these instruments.

The question provides some data about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and in some cases, extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness. I think the main thing I need to calculate is the apparent V magnitude for each star because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Starting with Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag.
- Distance is 10 pc.
I remember that the formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.
So plugging in the numbers: m = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 5*0 =15.5. So m=15.5.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So 15.5 is brighter than 17 → so Star1 is detectable by ESPRESSO. What about HIRES? HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. 15.5 is less than 16 (brighter), so Star1 is also detectable by HIRES. So Star1 is visible by both.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. The way the question is phrased, which stars can be detected with both. So if a star is brighter than the limit of both, it can be observed by both.

Wait, no, no—ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, meaning that they have V magnitudes less than 17 (since lower magnitude is brighter). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning their V magnitude is less than 16. So Star1 has m=15.5, which is less than both 16 and 17. So both can detect.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag.
- Distance is 5 pc, but wait, the apparent magnitude is given, so I don't need to calculate anything. It's already m=16.5.

So ESPRESSO requires m <17. 16.5 <17 → detectable. HIRES requires m <16. 16.5 is greater than 16 → not detectable. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, there's extinction (E(B-V) = 0.6 mag). So I need to calculate the extinction in V band. The question says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, no! Wait, no. Wait, the extinction makes the star appear dimmer. So if the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, the observed m will be m0 + A_V because higher magnitude means fainter.

Wait, but wait. Star3's given apparent magnitude is already the observed magnitude? Or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". But wait, that's after extinction? Or before? I think no, usually when you're given apparent magnitude and there's extinction, you have to correct it. So wait, I think the given m is the observed, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me read the question again.

The problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". Oh, so the apparent magnitude is the observed (i.e., after extinction). Or is it the intrinsic? I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think that if you don't account for extinction, the apparent magnitude would be lower. So when we have extinction, the star appears fainter, so the apparent magnitude increases. So the question gives Star3's apparent magnitude as 15.5, but I think that's without extinction. Or is it the observed, which is already after extinction? Hmm, this is a point of confusion.

Wait, the question states that the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So I think that when extinction is applied, the apparent magnitude becomes m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed is m + A_V. But wait, in the question, it's the apparent magnitude, which is already what we observe, so perhaps the given m is the observed. But then, the extinction would have already been applied. Hmm, no, that can't be. Because extinction is something that makes stars appear dimmer. So let's think again.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is the observed, which includes extinction. So if they're giving the apparent magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, but for calculating whether it's observed, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait no, no—because if the given m is the observed, then we don't need to adjust it. But I think the problem is that the given m is the intrinsic, so we need to calculate the observed m by adding the extinction.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So the apparent magnitude is the observed, which includes the extinction. Therefore, no further correction is needed. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you have extinction, it increases the apparent magnitude. So if the given m is already the observed, then the actual (intrinsic) m would be lower. But the question is about what the spectrograph can detect, which depends on the apparent magnitude as observed. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (as emitted), and we have to account for the extinction when calculating the observed m. So the observed m would be m = 15.5 + 3.1 * 0.6 = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So the apparent magnitude would be 17.36.

Wait, that would make sense. Because if there's extinction, the observed m is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So for Star3, the observed m is 17.36. So then, can ESPRESSO and/or HIRES detect it?

ESPRESSO observes stars with V mag brighter than 17. So 17.36 is fainter than 17 → not detectable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe up to 16. So 17.36 is way above, so neither can detect.

Wait, but wait the initial given data for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent (observed) magnitude, meaning that the extinction has already been accounted for. Then, the observed magnitude is 15.5, so without correction. So then, which spectrographs can detect it?

In that case, Star3 has m=15.5. So for ESPRESSO, which can see up to 17, 15.5 is less than 17 → detectable. HIRES sees up to 16. 15.5 <16 → detectable. So Star3 would be detectable by both.

But wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: if the given apparent magnitude is after extinction, then no further correction is needed. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16 and 17 → so detectable by both. But that's not matching my earlier thought. Wait, but the way the question is written, perhaps the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction is to be applied. Because for Star4, the same method would apply.

I think I need to clarify. Let's proceed by considering that the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, so the observed m is higher. Let me recalculate:

Star3:
Intrinsic m =15.5
E(B−V) =0.6. So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.
Observed m=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's observed m is 17.36.

So ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 17.36 is just above → not detectable. HIRES can't see it either. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but that's different. I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. So perhaps I need to clarify the scenario.

Wait another approach: For each star, compute the apparent V magnitude that would be observed (i.e., considering any extinction), and then see if that m is less than the thresholds of each instrument.

So:

For Star1:
m=15.5 (no extinction, since E(B-V) not given)
ESPRESSO: 15.5 <17 → yes.
HIRES: 15.5 <16 → yes.

Star2:
m=16.5 (apparent, no extinction given)
ESPRESSO: 16.5 <17 → yes.
HIRES: 16.5 >16 → no.

Star3:
Intrinsic m is 15.5 (given as apparent? Or is it the absolute? Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 1
