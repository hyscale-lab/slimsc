Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. There are two reactions given, and I need to choose from the options A to D.

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that butan-2-one is methyl propan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So, when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening here? I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or maybe addition reaction. Wait, but butanone has a ketone group. Oh right, the reaction of ketones with CN- is the nucleophilic addition.

Wait, in this case, NaCN is providing CN-. So the ketone would react with CN- in some way. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanism. I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone would form an enol, which would then react with the cyanide.

Wait, but I've heard about the Henry reaction, which is the alkylation of a ketone using a nitroalkane, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, when a ketone reacts with a nitrile under certain conditions, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yes, that's right! The cyanohydrin reaction. In this reaction, a ketone reacts with a cyanide (like NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. 

The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The cyanohydrin would add a hydroxyl and a cyanide group to the same carbon as the ketone. So, (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which fits the product. So, the reaction requires an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. Looking at the options, A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for reaction 1, A should be an acid catalyst.

Then, reaction 2: the cyanohydrin (2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative) is treated with B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, what's the second reaction here? The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, the structure is R-C(OH)-CN. When this is hydrolyzed under specific conditions, it can form a carboxylic acid. 

I think in acidic conditions, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But I also remember that the presence of a strong acid and water can help in this process. Alternatively, sometimes a base is used, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely acid-catalyzed.

Wait, the reagent B is in parentheses as H2O, so it's probably an aqueous solution, and the conditions are either acidic or basic. So for the second reaction, we have the nitrile attached to a hydroxyl group. I think when you have a cyanohydrin (which has an adjacent OH and CN), upon hydrolysis under acidic conditions, the CN group is converted into a COOH group. Because the nitrile is adjacent to an OH, it's more reactive. 

So, for that, the conditions are probably acidic. Let me recall: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat. Or sometimes, using a catalyst like HCl. So, looking at the options, B could be HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D). 

Wait, but what about the conditions in the second reaction? The product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction is likely a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. For that, the typical reagents are H2O with acid, like HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options, for reaction 2, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. 

So, to recap:
- Reaction 1: butanone + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. So A is an acid catalyst, probably H3O+ or something similar. So options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm not sure if that's used as an acid here. Alternatively, H3O+ is a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl. Or maybe it's
