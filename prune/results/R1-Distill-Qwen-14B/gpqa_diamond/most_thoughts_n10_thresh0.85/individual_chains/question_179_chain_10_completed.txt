Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves matrices and their properties related to quantum mechanics. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the time evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So I need to check each option based on these properties.

The matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Let me write them out for clarity.

W is a 3x3 matrix:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3    2i   5
-2i -2  -4i
5   4i   4

The options are A to D. I need to go through each one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, e^X is the matrix exponential. For the norm to change, the matrix exponential must not be unitary. Because if a matrix U is unitary, then U† U = I, so for any vector v, ||U v|| = ||v||. So if e^X is not unitary, there exists such a vector v where the norm changes.

But when is e^X unitary? Let me think. The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Skew-Hermitian matrices satisfy A† = -A. So if X is skew-Hermitian, e^X would be unitary. Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian means that X† = -X. Let's compute X†:

X† is the conjugate transpose. So the (1,1) element becomes the complex conjugate of X's (1,1), which is -i. Similarly, other elements are the rows turned into columns with conjugation.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† (conjugate transpose) is:

Column 1 becomes row 1 with conjugates:
-i, 1, -2i
Column 2 becomes row 2: 1, 0, 1
Column 3 becomes row 3: -2i, 1, i.

Wait, let me compute each element:

X†[1][1] = conjugate(X[1][1]) = conjugate(i) = -i
X†[1][2] = conjugate(X[2][1]) = 1 (since X[2][1] is 1)
X†[1][3] = conjugate(X[3][1]) = conjugate(2i)= -2i
X†[2][1] = conjugate(X[1][2])= conjugate(-1)= -1
X†[2][2] = conjugate(X[2][2])=0
X†[2][3] = conjugate(X[3][2])= conjugate(-1)= -1
X†[3][1] = conjugate(X[1][3])= conjugate(2i)= -2i
X†[3][2] = conjugate(X[2][3])= conjugate(1)=1
X†[3][3] = conjugate(X[3][3])= conjugate(-i)=i.

So X† is:
[-i, 1, -2i]
[-1, 0, -1]
[-2i, 1, i]

Now, is X† equal to -X?

Let me compute -X:

-X would be:
- i, 1, -2i
-1, 0, -1
-2i, 1, i

Comparing X† and -X:

X† row 1: [-i, 1, -2i]
-X row 1: [-i, 1, -2i] same.

X† row 2: [-1, 0, -1]
-X row 2: [-1, 0, -1] same.

X† row 3: [-2i, 1, i]
-X row3: [-2i, 1, i] same.

So yes, X† = -X. So X is skew-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X is unitary because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary.

If e^X is unitary, then for any vector v, ||e^X v|| = ||v||. So statement A says there exists a vector where the norm changes. But if e^X is unitary, this can't happen. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, a quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. Alternatively, if it's a pure state, it's a projector matrix (idempotent and Hermitian, trace 1).

But let's think about the expression. e^X is unitary since X is skew-Hermitian. So e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X because (e^X)(e^{-X})=I. So the expression is e^X Y e^{-X}.

Since e^X is unitary, this is a similarity transformation. Y is given as:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

Wait, is Y Hermitian? Let's check Y†.

Y is real, so Y† = Y^T. Y^T:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

Which is same as Y. So Y is symmetric. Therefore, Y is Hermitian.

So Y is a Hermitian matrix. Now, the similarity transformation of Y by a unitary matrix U (here, U = e^X) gives U Y U†. Since Y is Hermitian, U Y U† is also Hermitian, because (U Y U†)† = U Y† U† = U Y U†.

But what's the trace? The trace is invariant under similarity transformations. So Tr(U Y U†) = Tr(Y) = 0.5+0.25+0.25 = 1. So the trace is 1, which is a necessary condition for a density matrix.

But wait, for a density matrix, it also needs to be positive semi-definite. So, if Y is positive semi-definite, then U Y U† is also positive semi-definite, as unitary transformations preserve positive semi-definiteness (since they correspond to orthonormal basis changes).

But does Y have all non-negative eigenvalues? Let me check the eigenvalues of Y.

Y is a 3x3 matrix; perhaps it's diagonal or has some symmetry. Let me compute the determinant or eigenvalues.

Alternatively, since Y has all positive entries, but to know if it's positive definite, perhaps check if all leading minors are positive.

The (1,1) element is 0.5>0.

The determinant of the top-left 2x2 corner:

|0.5 0.1|
|0.1 0.25|

Determinant: (0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115>0.

Now, the determinant of Y itself. It's a bit more work, but let me compute it.

Y:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

Let me compute determinant using expansion.

det(Y) = 0.5 * det(minor(1,1)) - 0.1 * det(minor(1,2)) + 0.2 * det(minor(1,3)).

Minor(1,1) is:
0.25 0.1
0.1  0.25 → determinant is (0.25)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.1) = 0.0625 - 0.01 = 0.0525.

Minor(1,2) is:
0.1 0.1
0.2 0.25 → determinant is (0.1)(0.25) - (0.1)(0.2) = 0.025 - 0.02 = 0.005.

Minor(1,3) is:
0.1 0.25
0.2 0.1 → determinant is (0.1)(0.1) - (0.25)(0.2) = 0.01 - 0.05 = -0.04.

So det(Y) = 0.5 * 0.0525 - 0.1 * 0.005 + 0.2 * (-0.04)
= 0.02625 - 0.0005 - 0.008
= 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

Which is positive. So all leading minors are positive, suggesting Y is positive definite.

Therefore, Y is a positive definite Hermitian matrix with trace 1. So it is a valid density matrix, hence a valid quantum state. Then, when we transform Y by a unitary U, the result U Y U† is also a density matrix, thus a valid quantum state.

So option B says (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state. That seems correct because the transformed Y is a density matrix. So B is a correct statement.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

X is skew-Hermitian, as we saw earlier because X† = -X. So X is not Hermitian, because for Hermitian matrices, X†=X. So X is not an observable. So option C is incorrect.

Z: let's compute Z†.

Z is:

3    2i    5

-2i  -2   -4i

5    4i    4

Z† is the conjugate transpose. So rows become columns with elements conjugated.

Z†:

Row 1 becomes column 1's conjugate:
3 →3, 2i→-2i, 5→5
So first column of Z† is [3; -2i; 5]

Row 2 becomes column 2: -2i → 2i, -2 →-2, -4i →4i
So second column is [2i; -2;4i]

Row3 becomes column3:5→5,4i→-4i,4→4
Third column [5; -4i;4]

So Z† is:

3    2i    5

-2i  -2    4i

5   -4i    4

Wait, let me write it properly:

Z†:

[3, 2i,5]

[-2i, -2, 4i]

[5, -4i,4]

Now, compare Z and Z†:

Original Z:
Row1: 3, 2i,5
Row2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row3:5,4i,4

Z† is:

Row1:3, 2i,5

Row2: -2i, -2,4i

Row3:5,-4i,4

So Z† is not equal to Z. Because in Z, row2, column3 is -4i, while in Z†, row3, column2 is -4i. So the lower right of Z is 4, same as Z†. Hmm, but comparing Z and Z†, are they equal?

Wait, Z is:

3       2i       5
-2i     -2      -4i
5       4i       4

Z†:

3      2i        5
-2i    -2       4i
5      -4i      4

So the second row, third column of Z is -4i, but Z† has 4i there. So Z† != Z. Therefore, Z is not Hermitian. Hence, option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is unitary. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

A matrix U is unitary if U† U = I.

Let's compute W† W.

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

W† is the conjugate transpose. Since W is real, W† is W^T.

W^T is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

So W† = W^T = same as W because W is symmetric.

So W is its own transpose. So W† = W.

Compute W† W = W^2.

W squared:

W * W:

First row of W: [0,0,1]
Multiply with each column:

Column1: 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1
Column2:0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0
Column3:0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0

So first row of W^2: [1,0,0]

Similarly, row 2 of W: [0,1,0]
Multiply with columns:
Column1:0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0
Column2:0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1
Column3:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0

Row2 of W^2: [0,1,0]

Row3 of W: [1,0,0]
Multiply with columns:
Column1:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0
Column2:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0
Column3:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1

So W^2 is identity matrix I.

Therefore, W is unitary because W† W = I. So W is a unitary matrix, a valid evolution operator.

Now, X: as before, X is skew-Hermitian, which we found earlier. So e^X is unitary. But X itself is not unitary. Wait, no: the evolution operator is unitary, so it's the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix (since H is Hermitian, and e^{-i H} is unitary).

Wait, but the question is about W and X being the evolution operator. So do W and X themselves represent the evolution operator? Because the evolution operator is unitary, so both W and X must be unitary.

We know that W is unitary, as W^2 = I and W is orthogonal.

What about X? Is X unitary?

To check, compute X† X and see if it equals I.

X is:

i  -1  2i

1   0   1

2i -1  -i

X† is:

[-i, 1, -2i]

[-1, 0, -1]

[-2i, 1, i]

Now, compute X† X.

Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1) of X† X is:

(-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)

= (-i^2) +1 + (-4i^2)

i^2 = -1, so:

= -(-1) +1 + (-4*(-1)) 

= 1 +1 +4 =6.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute each term:

Row 1 of X†: [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Column 1 of X: [i, 1, 2i ]

So (1,1) element:

(-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)

= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)

= (1) +1 + (4) =6.

Hmm, so (1,1) is 6. But the identity matrix has 1 on the diagonal. So X† X is not identity. Therefore, X is not unitary. So option D says W and X represent the evolution operator. But X is not unitary, so D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B and D? Wait, no. Let's recap.

Wait, the options are:

A: Incorrect, since e^X is unitary, so no vector's norm changes.

B: Correct, because (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a density matrix.

C: Incorrect, since X and Z are not Hermitian (X is skew-Hermitian, Z is not Hermitian). So they are not observables.

D: Incorrect, because X is not unitary. So W is, but X isn't.

So the correct statement is option B.


To analyze the given matrices and determine the correct statement, we evaluate each option based on the properties of quantum mechanics, such as Hermiticity, unitarity, and density matrices.

  \]

### Option A:
**"There exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes."**

- The matrix exponential \( e^X \) is unitary because \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)). For any unitary matrix \( U \), \( U v \) preserves the norm of any vector \( v \).  
- Therefore, the norm of the vector does not change, and this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option B:
**"\( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a quantum state."**

- \( e^X \) is unitary, so \( e^{-X} = (e^X)^\dagger \). The expression \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is a similarity transformation of \( Y \) by a unitary matrix.  
- \( Y \) is Hermitian (\( Y^\dagger = Y \)) and has a trace of 1. Additionally, \( Y \) is positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues are non-negative).  
- A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. Since \( Y \) satisfies these conditions, \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is also a valid density matrix.  
- This statement is **correct**.

---

### Option C:
**"Z and X represent observables."**

- Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices (\( A^\dagger = A \)).  
- \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), not Hermitian, so it is not an observable.  
- \( Z \) is also not Hermitian because \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \).  
- This statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option D:
**"W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system."**

- The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is unitary (\( U^\dagger U = I \)).  
- \( W \) is unitary because \( W^\dagger W = I \).  
- \( X \), however, is not unitary because \( X^\dagger X \neq I \).  
- Since \( X \) is not unitary, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **B**.  
**Answer: B**
