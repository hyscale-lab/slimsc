Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates under a restoring force, like in Hooke's law. But this is a relativistic version, so I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant, m is the mass, and A is the amplitude. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. Since the problem is relativistic, I probably can't use that formula directly.

In relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in the relativistic scenario, I'm not sure how that translates. Oh right, maybe we should think in terms of relativistic energy equations.

Wait, but the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic, right? Because in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but perhaps for maximum speed, we can consider the maximum point where all energy is kinetic.

Wait, no. At the maximum displacement A, the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic, so at the equilibrium point (x=0), it has maximum kinetic. But since this is relativistic, the speed can't reach the speed of light. So how do we relate the energy here?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of energy conservation. At the maximum displacement A, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic is zero. Then, as the mass moves towards x=0, the potential decreases, and kinetic increases. At x=0, kinetic energy is maximum.

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K_max, where K_max is the maximum kinetic energy.

But wait, the potential energy at A is (1/2)kA². In a classical oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is larger because of the gamma factor.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations properly.

In the classical case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², so K_max = (1/2)kA². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So, in the maximum velocity case, all potential energy is converted into kinetic, but including relativistic effects.

Wait, but another approach. The energy equation for the oscillator is E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (x=0, all energy is kinetic). So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

But wait, the potential energy in the relativistic case... Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential is (1/2)kx², but when velocities approach c, the kinetic energy increases, so perhaps the potential energy expression might change, but I don't think so. The problem states that it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx² regardless of velocity.

Wait, but in reality, if we have relativistic speeds, does Hooke's law still apply as F = -kx, or does it change? I think the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx is correct.

So, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², but that's in the non-relativistic case. Wait, no, that's when the potential energy is maximum at A. But in relativity, the total energy would be higher because the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to frame the equations.

At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero. So all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is just the potential energy.

But wait, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is mc². Then, the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At maximum speed, when x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is equal to the kinetic energy plus rest energy.

So, E = mc² + K_max.

But K_max is (gamma -1) mc². So,

E = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but earlier when x=A, E = (1/2)kA². But that can't be right because in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest and kinetic. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, no, because at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy K is zero, but the total energy should be E = mc² + K = mc².

But wait, that can't be right because the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So in that case, the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². Because the potential energy is non-relativistic? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the virial theorem. The average kinetic and potential energies in a harmonic oscillator are equal, but in the relativistic case, that might not hold. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the expressions for velocity in terms of the potential.

In the non-relativistic case, the velocity as a function of position is given by v² = (k/m)(A² - x²). So at x=0, v_max² = (k/m) A², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic scenario, option C can't be correct.

Wait, but the problem is relativistic, so we can't use that formula. So perhaps we need to find an expression where the velocity is less than c, and includes a relativistic correction.

Let me think about how velocity relates to energy.

The total energy of the oscillator is E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy, but in the relativistic case, K = (gamma -1) mc².

At maximum velocity, the potential energy is zero, so E = K + mc².

But the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 mc²) as some term alpha for simplicity.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

We can square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

1 = (1 + alpha)^2 (1 - v²/c²).

Expanding,

1 = (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²)(1 - v²/c²).

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to rearrange the equation for v.

Let me write:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which can be written as,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²)/(1 + alpha)^2.

If alpha is small (non-relativistic), then alpha² is negligible compared to 2 alpha. So,

v²/c² ≈ (2 alpha)/(1 + alpha)^2.

But that's the non-relativistic limit, so perhaps in the maximum case, alpha could be significant.

Wait, but what's alpha? It's (kA²)/(2 mc²). So if kA² is much smaller compared to mc², then it's non-relativistic. But if kA² is comparable to mc², then it's more relativistic.

So back to the expression for v_max²/c²:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should factor the numerator.

(1 + alpha)^2 -1 = 2 alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha².

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) = (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha (1 + alpha/2 ).

Wait, perhaps I can write it as (2 alpha (1 + alpha/2 ))/(1 + alpha)^
