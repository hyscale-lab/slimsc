Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit back and forth as the planet orbits it.

Alright, here's what the problem says. There are two stars with the same mass, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The first planet (Planet #1) caused a periodic shift of 5 milliangstroms in the spectral line. Planet #2's star showed a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how much longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm, wait, the RV method detects the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is related to the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / (M_star + M_p))^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) ). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach. The RV method tells us that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), assuming that M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun). So sin i would be roughly 1 for circular orbits, which they have here.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass (M), and both planets have similar masses (so M_p1 ≈ M_p2), the ratio of their K velocities should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods. Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, because K ∝ (M_p)/(M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ). Since M_p is the same for both, and M_star is same, the ratio K1/K2 would be (1/(P1^(1/3))) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So solving for K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Are these shifts proportional to K? Because the spectral line shift is proportional to the velocity. So the measured K (velocity semi-amplitude) would be proportional to the shift in wavelength. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So putting it together: K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So we can solve for (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait. Wait, if K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a proportionality constant. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So then, to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1).

So (5/7)^3 is 125 / 343. Let me calculate that. 125 divided by 343 is approximately 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364, which means that P2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as P1. So how much longer is P2 than P1? Oh wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2's orbital period than P1's. So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the correct ratio would be P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (1.4)^3 = 2.744. So P1 is approximately 2.744 times longer than P2. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

Wait, the question is: How many times longer is P2's period than P1's?

So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of P2 is ~0.36 times that of P1, meaning P1 is longer, and P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A. But wait, the way the question is phrased: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, so it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me re-do this.

We have K1 = 5, K2 = 7 (in some units). And K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 → (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364 → P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2's period is 0.36 times that of P1, which is shorter. So the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So it's 0.36 times longer, which is 0.36. So option A is the answer.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because a larger K would mean higher velocity, which would correspond to a shorter period for the planet. Because the star is moving more in its orbit, implying a higher velocity. But the period is the time the planet takes to orbit. So higher K (faster star movement) → shorter period. Because the star has to move more quickly to keep up with the planet's shorter orbital period.

Wait, yes. The planet with the larger K (7 milliangstrom) would have a shorter period than the one with K=5. So in the problem, K2 is larger than K1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, meaning it's not longer. The question is how many times longer, which would be 1/(0.36) = about 2.77, but that's not an option. So the answer is A, 0.36, because P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) shifts. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass.

The relationship between \( K \) and \( P \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their RV shifts is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \).
