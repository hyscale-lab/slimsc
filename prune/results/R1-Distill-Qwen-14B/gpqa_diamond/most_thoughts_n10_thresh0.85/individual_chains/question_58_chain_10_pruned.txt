Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum theories, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it has something to do with dealing with infinities in calculations. Like when you calculate loop diagrams in quantum field theories, you often get divergent integrals—these are infinities that pop up. Regularization is a way to make those calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method, right?

So the theories that require regularization are the ones where these infinities appear and need to be handled. If a theory doesn't have such issues, maybe it doesn't need regularization.

Let me think about each option:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, dealing with Maxwell's equations. In classical theories, you don't have the same kind of infinities as in quantum theories because you're not dealing with probabilities and observables the same way. So maybe classical theories like this don't require regularization. But wait, I'm not sure. Do any problems in classical electrodynamics lead to infinities? Like, for example, point charges have issues with their own fields at the origin, but those are more conceptual and perhaps handled differently, like through the principle of superposition or considering distributions. But I don't think regularization is part of classical theory since regularization is a quantum field theory concept.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory where particles like electrons and photons are considered. I know that in QED, you get things like the electron self-energy which leads to divergent loop diagrams. These require regularization techniques, like introducing a momentum cutoff or using dimensional regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with the strong interaction, and it's a non-abelian gauge theory. I remember that QCD has issues with things like the running coupling and confinement. But in terms of regularization, since it's a quantum field theory with loops, it would have divergences that need to be regularized. So I think B does require regularization.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of infinities as in QFT. Wait, why is that? Oh right, because in string theory, the basic objects are strings rather than point particles. The loop divergences in QFT come from integrating over all momenta, especially high momenta where particles are treated as points. Strings have a length scale (the string length) which introduces a natural cutoff. So in string theory, perhaps the integrals don't go to infinity the same way, so you don't need to regularize. So superstring theory might be the one that doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but wait another thing. How about loop diagrams in string theory? Do they avoid divergences? I think in string theory, especially the perturbative expansion involves string diagrams that don't have the same type of divergences because the underlying structure is different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization because it doesn't have the same divergent loop integrals that QFT does.

Putting it all together: the question is which theory doesn't require regularization. So D is classical, which isn't a QFT, so probably doesn't use regularization. But wait, is regularization a concept that only applies to quantum theories? Because regularization is about handling infinities in QFT calculations. Classical theories don't have that problem because they're not calculating probabilities with integrals that diverge. So for option D, classical electrodynamics, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, the question is about "physical theories"—does that include classical ones?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which of the following physical theories never requires regularization". So if a theory doesn't need regularization because the infinities don't appear, then which
