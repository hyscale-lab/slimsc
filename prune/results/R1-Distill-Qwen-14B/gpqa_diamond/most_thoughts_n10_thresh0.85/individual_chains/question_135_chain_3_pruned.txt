Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me read the question again. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Hmm, first, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the interaction term allows it. The Lagrangian here seems to involve X interacting with fermions. The term looks like X ψ̄ ψ, which would mean that X can couple to fermions, so it can decay into two fermions.

Wait, the way the Lagrangian is written, X is multiplying the fermion fields. So the interaction is X ψ ψ. So the coupling is between X and two fermions. So the decay process would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

Now, the possible fermions that X can decay into depend on two things: the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. Because for a decay to happen kinematically, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would have to have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So X's mass is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass of each fermion would be 3 GeV each, but wait, that's not exactly correct because in reality, the threshold is when the combined rest mass is equal to the boson's mass. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, particles like the top quark have a mass around 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. But wait, looking at the options, option C includes t and t̄, but X's mass is only 6 GeV, so top quark is way too heavy. So that's impossible. So any option with top quarks is out, right? So option C includes t t̄, which can't happen. So we can eliminate option C.

But wait, in the Lagrangian, is the coupling to all fermions or only specific ones? The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps the X couples to all fermions. Or perhaps only to specific flavors. Well, the question says the interaction is with fermions, so perhaps it's a Yukawa-type interaction, which usually couples to specific fermions, but the problem statement doesn't specify which. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are involved. So perhaps I can assume that X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Wait, no, each fermion's mass must be less than 6 GeV because the decay is into two identical particles. So each must have mass ≤ 6 GeV /2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, no. In pair production, each fermion must have mass less than or equal to m_X/2. So for X to decay into f and f̄, the mass of f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me list the masses of known fermions:

Electron: negligible, ≈0 GeV.

Muon: about 0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV).

Tau: around 1.78 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up quark: ~2 MeV (so much less than 3 GeV).

Down quark: ~4-5 MeV.

Strange: ~95-100 MeV.

Charm: ~1.2-1.5 GeV.

Bottom: ~4-5 GeV.

Top: ~173 GeV.

So any quarks lighter than or equal to 3 GeV can be considered. So up, down, strange, charm are all below 3 GeV. Bottom is around 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so can't be. So X can decay into u, d, s, c quarks, and leptons like e, mu, tau.

Wait, wait, the tau is ~1.78 GeV, so its mass is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs. So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ū,

d d̄,

s s̄,

c c̄.

Wait, but wait, the charm quark is about 1.5
