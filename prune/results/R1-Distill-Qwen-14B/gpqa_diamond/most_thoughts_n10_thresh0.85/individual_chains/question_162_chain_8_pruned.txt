Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface in geometry, maybe related to hyperbolic geometry or something? Or wait, pseudosphere might be a term used in different contexts. Oh right, in some contexts, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). I think this is a 2-dimensional metric because it has dx² and dy² terms. So this is a 2D surface, maybe embedded in higher dimensions, but the metric itself is 2D.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, radius is given as 2. So maybe this metric is for a pseudosphere with radius 2. But I'm a bit confused about how to get the area from the metric.

I remember that the area in a 2D metric can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

So first, I need to write the metric in matrix form. The given metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx. And g_xy = g_yx = 0 because there's no cross term.

So the metric tensor is diagonal. The determinant g is g_xx * g_yy because it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, but for area, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) is sqrt(32²/(4 - x² - y²)^2) ) = (32)/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but 32 is 32, so sqrt(32^2)=32. So area element dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But the area of the pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over all x and y where the metric is valid. But wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the metric is defined when 4 - x² - y² > 0. Because if it's zero or negative, the denominator would be zero or negative, leading to a singularity or imaginary numbers. So the domain is x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the (x,y) plane.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. So I'm integrating over x and y where x² + y² < 4. Let me write the area as:

A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

But wait, 4 - (x² + y²) is the same as 4 - r², where r² = x² + y². So maybe switching to polar coordinates would make this integral easier.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral over θ is straightforward. The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, so that's 2π. So the area becomes:

A = 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let's compute this integral. Let me factor out the constants:

32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, so 32 * 2π is 64π. So the integral becomes 64π ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, I can compute this integral. Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ [ (r dr) / u ] = ∫ (-1/2) du / u.

But when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the limits are from u=4 to u=0. But when we substitute, we have:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-1/2) (du/u) ]

Wait, the substitution gives us:

r dr = (-1/2) du.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( (-1/2) du ) / u ]

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (du/u) = (-1/2) [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ]

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0 is the same as integrating from 0 to 4 and multiplying by -1. So:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, so the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 becomes divergent because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the integrand approaches infinity.

Hmm, but wait, the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2 is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [ - (r dr)/(r² -4) ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try another approach.

Compute ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (−1/2) du = r dr.

So substitution gives:

∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ [ (r dr ) / u ] = ∫ (-1/2 du) / u.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) ) = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Substituting back, u=4 - r². So the integral is (-1/2) ln|4 - r²| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: (-1/
