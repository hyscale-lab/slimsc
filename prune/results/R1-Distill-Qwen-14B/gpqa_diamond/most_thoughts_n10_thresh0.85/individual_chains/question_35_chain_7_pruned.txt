Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A. They give that A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which equals c times S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators have specific forms, especially in the Pauli matrix context. Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used for spin-1/2 particles. Let me think—what's the structure of S here? Oh, S looks like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is the Pauli σy matrix.

And the operator Ay is c times σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

To find the eigenvalues, I know that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix Ay:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, no. No, actually, S is σy, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when multiplied by c, each element is multiplied by c. So Ay is c*(σy) which is:

Ay = 
[ [0, -i*c],
  [i*c, 0] ]

So c is h/(4π). Plugging that in, the elements become:

0, -i*(h/(4π)) in the top right, and i*(h/(4π)) in the bottom left.

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [-a, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) ]

Compute each part. 

Determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1.

So determinant = a² - [1 * (h²/(16 π²)) ] = 0.

So equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but the options given in the choices don't seem to directly match that. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, wait. Wait, no, the eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, no—the matrix Ay is Hermitian?

Wait, let's think: S is σy, which is Hermitian because σy is Hermitian (since σy equals its conjugate transpose). So c times σy is Hermitian because c is real. So Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues must be real.

Wait, that's a key point. So the eigenvalues are real numbers. So they can’t have imaginary parts. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts would
