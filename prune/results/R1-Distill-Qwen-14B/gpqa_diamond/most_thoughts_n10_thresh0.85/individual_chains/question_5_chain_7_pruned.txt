Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the eigenvector for a given operator. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0, 1] and second row [1, 0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0, -i] and second [i, 0]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled.

Pz is (ħ/2) times the matrix [1, 0; 0, -1]. So that's the Pauli Z scaled.

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So, any vector in x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates with θ in the x-z plane, and phi=0 because it's in the x-z plane.

So, the operator P along direction n is P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute n_x and n_z. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, what's the direction vector? Let me think. The direction n is a unit vector. So, yes, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y = 0.

So, putting it all together, P = (sinθ) * P_x + (cosθ) * P_z.

Each of P_x and P_z is (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So, substituting in:

P = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2) to make it easier.

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1], [1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0], [0,-1]] ]

Multiplying the matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ * 1.
The (1,2) element is sinθ * 1.
The (2,1) element is sinθ * 1.
The (2,2) element is -cosθ * 1.

So, P = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, let me double-check that. For the first row, element 1,1 is cosθ *1, because it's from the P_z term. Element 1,2 is sinθ * (from P_x) which is 1. Second row, element 2,1 is sinθ*1 from P_x, and 2,2 is -cosθ from P_z.

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

But scaled by (ħ/2).

Now, the eigenvector equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. We're looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [1; 0] * [a; b]

Wait, not quite. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ a + sinθ b , sinθ a - cosθ b ]^T = (ħ/2) [ a ; b ]

Wait, but wait, I think I should instead set up the equation without the scaling factor. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the matrix equation as:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Because when we multiply by (ħ/2), both sides are scaled by (ħ/2), so the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) λ |v> → M |v> = λ |v> where λ is the given eigenvalue.

Wait, no, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the equation is:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) (+1/2 ħ) |v> ?

Wait, perhaps I should recast the problem. Let me think again.

Wait, no: the operator P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So, when we write P |v> = λ |v>, the λ is the eigenvalue. So, in this case, λ is given as +ħ/2.

So, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = (ħ/2) * [a; b]

Wait, no. Wait, the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> ?

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is ħ/2. So, P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> ?

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) times the matrix. So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) * M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, but M is the matrix with elements [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Then, if we factor out (ħ/2), we can write (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) λ |v> → M |v> = λ |v>

So, λ is the given eigenvalue, which is +ħ/2. Wait, no, because in the equation above, P |v> = λ |v>, so λ is the eigenvalue. So, in this case, λ is +ħ/2.

Wait, but substituting, M |v> = (λ / (ħ/2)) |v>

Wait, let me re-express. Let me denote the matrix as M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So,
