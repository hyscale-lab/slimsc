Okay, so I'm trying to answer this quantum mechanics question about a diatomic molecule's energy states and the photon momentum needed for a transition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to absorb a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I remember that in quantum models, especially the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have specific structures. Oh right, the fundamental state is usually the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state, which is the ground state.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so it's a diatomic like O2 or something else. The states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon.

I think the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between the two states. But wait, what's the lowest possible energy transition? Oh, right, in molecular vibrations, the fundamental transition is from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1). Because that's the lowest energy jump possible in vibrations. So the photon should provide exactly the energy difference for this vibration.

Wait, but wait, the molecule could also change its rotational state. Oh, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the molecule could make a transition that requires the least energy. But the vibrational energy is usually higher than rotational, right? No, actually no. The vibrational energy levels are more spaced apart than rotational, I think. So the fundamental vibrational transition (n=0 to n=1) requires more energy than some rotational transitions.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which would be the lowest energy state of both rotation and vibration. So the next possible state could either be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But to get the lowest possible energy transition (so the photon with the least energy), perhaps the rotational transition is lower. Hmm, but how do I know which has a lower energy difference?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state, but the rotational part could be in a higher state. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest, so maybe it's vibrationally in n=0 and rotationally in the lowest J state, which is J=0.

Wait, but the rotation-vibration model combines both vibrations and rotations, so the total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. So the next state would have the lowest possible energy, meaning the next higher energy state. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (n=0→n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=0→J=1). Which of these has a lower energy difference?

I think the energy difference for the first vibrational transition is much larger than the rotational transitions. Because the vibrational energy depends on the square of the quantum number, but each rotational level is spaced by B (rotational constant), which is much smaller than the vibrational energy spacing.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels. Vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (n + 1/2) hν, where ν is the frequency. The spacing between n=0 and n=1 is hν. For rotational, the energy is E_rotational = (J (J+1) ) * B, where B is the rotational constant. The spacing between J=0 and J=1 is 2B (since E(1) - E(0) is [2B*1(2)] - [0] = 2B? Wait, no. Let me correct: E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * B. So E(0)=0, E(1)=2B, E(2)=6B, etc. So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. The difference between J=1 and J=2 is 4B, etc.

So the vibrational energy difference is hν, and the rotational difference is 2B. Which is smaller? Well, B is the rotational constant, which is given by h/(8π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia, and c is some constant. Wait, but in terms of actual values, rotational constants are typically in the range of 10^-4 to 10^-2 cm^-1, while vibrational frequencies are in the range of 10^3 to 10^5 cm^-1. So hν would be much larger than 2B. So the rotational transition (J=0→J=1) would require a smaller energy.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state overall. So in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next possible state, which could be either n=0, J=1 (rotational) or n=1, J=0 (vibrational). Which of these is lower in energy?

Since vibrational energy is much higher per quantum jump than rotational, the next state (the one with the least energy increase) would be the rotational J=1 state. So the photon needs to provide the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy of the system is the sum of rotational and vibrational. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the system has the minimal increase in energy.

So the possible transitions are:

1. From (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1) → energy change is 2B.
2. From (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0) → energy change is hν.

Which of these is smaller? Since B is much smaller than ν (because B is in cm^-1 and ν is much higher), 2B < hν. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the photon's energy needed.

Wait, but wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state after (n=0, J=0) is the state with the least energy increase. Thus, the photon must match the energy needed for the J=0→J=1 transition.

Wait, no. Actually, the energy levels are quantized, so the next state in energy is the one with the smallest possible energy jump. So if 2B is less than hν, then the photon's energy should be 2B. But wait, in the question, it's about momentum, not energy. Oh right, because the options are in momentum units.

So the photon's momentum p is related to its energy E. Since E = pc (for a photon, because E = hf and p = h/(λ), and c=λf, so E=pc), so p = E/c.

Wait, but hold on. Let's confirm. For a photon, E = hf, and p = E/c. So yes, p is E divided by c.

Therefore, to find the momentum, I need to calculate the energy difference required for the transition, then divide by c.

But wait, which transition are we considering? The one with the smallest energy difference is the rotational one, 2B. So E = 2B.

So the photon's energy should be 2B, so p = (2B)/c.

Wait, but let me make sure. The energy for the rotational transition is 2B. So E_photon = 2B.

So p = E / c = (2B) / c.

Now, B is the rotational constant, which is given by B = (h)/(8 π² I c_rot), where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula for B. Let me think.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ) * B, where B is the rotational constant. The moment of inertia I is given by I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So, to find B, we can use the formula B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where k is the Boltzmann constant? Or wait, no, I think B is given by
