Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The problem states that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, and without normalization, the probabilities won't add up to 1. 

Wait, right, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. So, let's compute the magnitude of each.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Oh wait, no, wait: the magnitude of a complex number a+bi is sqrt(a² + b²). So for (1+i), that's sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2). For (2-i), it's sqrt(2² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). 

So the squared magnitudes are (sqrt(2))^2 = 2 and (sqrt(5))^2 =5. Adding those gives 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), right? So the state |alpha> is 1/sqrt(7) times [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Wait, wait, the question says it's proportional to that. So I need to normalize it. So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7).

But wait, wait a second. No, wait, no. Because the overall state is proportional to that, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ). Which we computed as sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>. 

Now, the operator whose matrix is given. The matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, it's diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is A = (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ). Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So in terms of the basis |up> and |down>, it's the sum of the off-diagonal elements. 

Wait, but what's this operator? It's an observable, so its eigenstates are the eigenstates of this matrix. Let me think. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and same off-diagonal elements are +/- something. Let me compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix is [[0, a], [a, 0]] where a = ħ
