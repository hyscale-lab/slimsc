Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about electric fields and conductors. Hmm.

So, the setup is a spherical conductor with radius R, and it's uncharged. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, s must be less than R because the cavity is entirely within the conductor. The point P is outside the conductor, and we're supposed to find the electric field at point P.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, but a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero.

Let me recall the concept. For a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have an equal and opposite charge. Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. But wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, because the conductor must have zero net charge? Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the net charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q. Or wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the sum of inner and outer must be zero. Hmm.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of charges on inner and outer surfaces must be zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (because the cavity is inside, the conductor's material will have induced charges). Then the outer surface must have +q, because the inner surface is -q, and the conductor's total is zero. So the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, that would make the conductor's total charge zero: (-q from
