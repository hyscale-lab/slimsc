Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the conditions can be described using the Boltzmann distribution.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I remember that the excitation of atoms depends on temperature and energy levels. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here, right?

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, g_i is the statistical weight, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Since we're comparing two stars, I guess I should set up the ratio for each star and then compare them.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: does that mean the ratio n1/n2 is 2? Or is it the ratio of their excitation levels to their ground states? Maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of excited states to the lower state. Let's say for each star, the population in the excited state is n, and in the lower state is m. The excitation ratio would be n/m, which is given as twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the question says "twice as excited" so maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Let's let star_1 have a ratio R1 and star_2 have R2. Then R1 = 2 R2. 

Each R is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio R is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), assuming that the lower state is the denominator and the upper is the numerator. But wait, the problem states that the energy difference is between the considered levels, so ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, no, actually, typically the Boltzmann equation is written as n_j/n_i = exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), assuming E_j > E_i. So if i is the lower state and j is the upper, then n_j/n_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive. 

But in this problem, the question is about the excitation, so I think we're looking at the ratio of upper to lower states. So R = n_j/n_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But wait, that would mean that higher temperature leads to a higher R because the exponent becomes smaller (since T is in denominator), so the exponential increases. Wait, is that right? Let me see: as T increases, the exponent -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So yes, higher T leads to higher ratio R.

Now, given that for star_1, R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1 = 2 R2. But R is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so for each star:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So substituting R1 = 2 R2,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, can I take the natural log of both sides? Let's do that.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me rearrange this equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me see:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, perhaps I should subtract the two R expressions. Alternatively, let me reorganize the equation:

After taking logs,

ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2)

Which is ln(2) = ln(R1) - ln(R2)

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So ln(R1) = -ΔE/(k T1)

ln(R2) = -ΔE/(k T2)

Then ln(R1) - ln(R2) = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

= ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

So this equals ln(2).

So,

ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me double-check that. Because:

ln(R1) - ln(R2) = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

= (ΔE /k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Wait, because ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) minus ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) is equal to ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

So,

(ΔE/(k)) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Hmm, I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, that's the equation we have.

But looking at the options, none of them have the ΔE term. Wait, the options present equations for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. But in our equation, we have ΔE and k. But wait, maybe the question is assuming that the energy difference is the same for both
