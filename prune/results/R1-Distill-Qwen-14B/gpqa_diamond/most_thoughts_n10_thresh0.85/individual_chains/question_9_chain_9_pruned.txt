Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations like rotations and reflections that leave the molecule looking the same. C3h is a type of symmetry that I think involves a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I should probably start by recalling what each of these symmetry groups mean. Oh right, the notation comes from the Schoenflies notation. The C in C3h stands for cyclic, and the h for horizontal mirror plane. So that implies a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis, and a horizontal mirror plane that goes through it.

Now, looking at the options, I see four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[furan]-something, and triphenyleno[furan]-something. I'm a bit rusty on these structures, so maybe I should think about each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think that's a borane where boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. So the structure would be something like B with three isopropyl substituents. Isopropyl groups are CH(CH3)2. So, would the molecule have three identical groups? Yes. Since they're all the same, maybe it has a threefold symmetry. Wait, but the arrangement matters. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around boron, which is trigonal planar, maybe it has a threefold rotation axis. But wait, what about the mirror planes? Do they have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, wait. Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is like a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, but arranged in a way that the boron is in the center. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. If the molecule is symmetric in that plane, then it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would bisect it. But I'm not entirely sure because the isopropyl groups have their own structure.

Wait, but maybe the structure is such that there's a plane that cuts through the boron and the middle of each isopropyl group. If that's the case, then each isopropyl group would be a mirror image across that plane. So that would make the molecule have a mirror plane. So if it has a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, it would have C3h symmetry. So triisopropyl borate might be a candidate.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's a norbornane derivative, a bridged bicyclic amine. The structure has a bridge, so it's more like a cage structure. Wait, what's the symmetry of quinuclidine? I remember that quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, so maybe it has a threefold rotation axis. But I'm not certain about the mirror planes. Norbornane (
