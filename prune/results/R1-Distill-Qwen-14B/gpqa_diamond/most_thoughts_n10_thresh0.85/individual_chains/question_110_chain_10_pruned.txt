Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, but only brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES. So to be detected by both, a star must be brighter than 16 mag because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so both can see it. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Because the condition is the apparent magnitude. Let me think: HIRES can detect stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star must have V mag less than or equal to 16 to be detectable by both. Because anything brighter than 16 (which is, lower magnitude numbers are brighter) would be detectable by both. Wait, no: magnitudes are counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes mean brighter. So V=15 is brighter than V=16. So the limit for ESPRESSO is apparent V mag up to 17 (so V ≤ 17), HIRES up to 16 (V ≤16). So to detect with both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16, because that's the lower limit of the two. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's ≤16, then it's within both limits. If it's 17, HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. So only stars with V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Now, let's look at each star's apparent V magnitude. Wait, some stars have absolute magnitude, so I need to calculate apparent magnitude.

Looking at the stars:
