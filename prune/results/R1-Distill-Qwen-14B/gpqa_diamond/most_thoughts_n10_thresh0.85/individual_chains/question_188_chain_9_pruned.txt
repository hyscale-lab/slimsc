Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. It's about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is actually part of the cubic system but with all edges equal and angles not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. No, rhombohedral is a subclass of the cubic system where all edges are equal (a = b = c) and the angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So yeah, that's correct.

The question gives a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles 30 degrees. The plane is (111), which are the Miller indices. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos alpha) - (2kl cos beta) - (2lh cos gamma) ) ), but wait, is that right? Or is there another formula when the angles aren't 90 degrees?

Wait another thought: Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (not necessarily cubic) and angles α, β, γ is a bit more complicated. But in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c, and all angles are equal, the formula might simplify.

Wait, the standard formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(kl cos β) - 2(lh cos γ) ) ) multiplied by 1/a, but wait, no, I think the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ ), but in this case, since a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and all angles are 30 degrees, because it's rhombohedral, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

Wait, so substituting in the values, h, k, l are 1,1,1 because
