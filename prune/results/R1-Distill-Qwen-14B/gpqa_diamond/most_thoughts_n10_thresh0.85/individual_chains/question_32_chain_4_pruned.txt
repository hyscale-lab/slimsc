Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and in this case, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that must be lithium-6, right? Because lithium usually has an atomic number of 3. So the number of protons is 3, and with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 +3 =6. So X is Li-6.

Next, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, I don't remember the exact mass, but I think I can calculate it. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass lost due to binding energy. But for an approximate calculation, maybe I can use the average mass of a nucleon. Wait, but more accurately, I might need the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a proton and neutron. Let me think. A proton's rest mass is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron's is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass energy would be: 3*(938) + 3*(939.565) = let me calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = let's see, 3 * 939 is 2817, and 3 * 0.565 is 1.695, so total 2817 + 1.695=2818.695 MeV.

Adding both parts: 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. That's 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I think the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less than that because of binding energy. But perhaps the problem ignores binding energy and just uses the sum? Alternatively, maybe the mass is given as the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the nucleus would have protons and neutrons, but I think when considering the rest mass of the nucleus, it's the sum of the protons and neutrons' rest masses minus any mass lost due to binding energy. But if I'm not given that, maybe the problem just wants me to use the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass, but it's not in the question. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the lithium ion as a whole, but I don't have that value. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the assumption that the rest mass is approximately 5.63 GeV.

Wait, but wait! Another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about
