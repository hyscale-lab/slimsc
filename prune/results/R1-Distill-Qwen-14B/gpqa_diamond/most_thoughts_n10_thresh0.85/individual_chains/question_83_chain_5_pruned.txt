Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I need to understand what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it forms acetate ions and water. The titration process involves neutralization, so I'll have to consider the reactions and the resulting solutions at different stages.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the initial concentration after dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the new concentration (C1) would be (volume before dilution × initial concentration) / total volume after dilution.

Wait, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initial concentration (M1) is 0.05 M, volume (V1) is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.0125 M. Wait, no, wait: 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol? Wait, wait. Let me think. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. When diluted to 0.04 L (40 cm³), then concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait! So I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me correct that.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed: same as acetic acid, so 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the titration question is about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, the question says "25% titration." I think that refers to 25% of the equivalence volume. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, for the first part: pH at 25% titration.

At this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, we can calculate the amounts of acetic acid and acetate ion present.

Let me outline the approach. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid (0.025 mol/L). When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid to produce acetate ions.

At 25% titration: 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 mol, the moles of acid neutralized are 0.00025 mol, so remaining acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the solution volume is now the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So, total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] =
