Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh right, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit its star. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter period.

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they've expanded to the same size as Planet_2's star. That probably means Planet_2's star is a bit younger or less evolved, maybe a main-sequence star, while Planet_1's might be a subgiant or something, since the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Wait, no, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So Planet_2's star is more evolved, perhaps. But both have the same radius, so maybe they're both in a similar state that makes their radii the same despite their mass differences.

Now, the question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Wait, no, more specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But since we don't know the orientation, the probability is the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view.

So the formula for the transit probability is something like P = (R_star / a) * (some other factors). But wait, another approach: the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that we see a transit is (R_star / a) * (some function of the star's size and planet's orbit). Or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by another term. Hmm.

Wait, I think the geometric probability for a transit is (R_star / a). But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The probability P is the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit projects onto the sky. So the formula is P = (π (R_star)^2) / (π a^2 (1 - e^2)^(3/2)), but if the orbit is circular (e=0), it's P = (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I remember that the geometric probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1, so it's just R_star / a.

Wait, but another source says that the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (some function). Let me get this right. Ok, the transit occurs when the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, passes in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star that can be occulted by the planet to the area of the planet's orbit when projected onto the sky. But because the planet's orbit is a circle, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, squared, divided by something else? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular size to the planet's orbital angular size. So the angular size of the star is (R_star / d), where d is the distance to the star. The angular size of the planet's orbit is (a / d). So the ratio is R_star / a. So the probability is (R_star / a) * something.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The probability is actually the fraction of the orbit where the planet would cross our line of sight. So it's (R_star / a), because for a circular orbit, the chance that the planet's path intersects the star is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P = (R_star / a), multiplied by a factor that accounts for the inclination, but since the inclination is random, the probability is just (
