Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The details given are that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are different; Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, so I remember that the luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. The peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if both have the same λ_max, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. But wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Oh no, wait! Because the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply λ_max for both is the same, which would imply T is the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, I'm a little confused. Because if their temperatures are the same, then their luminosities would depend on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² times T⁴. So if T is same, L is proportional to R².

So Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, wait, the options
