Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember from my notes that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions when it's in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, stochiometric probably means a 1:1 ratio.

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constant, right, that's the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. 

So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, let me think. In a 1:1 complex, the formation constant equation would be:

K = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand])

But what's the concentration of metal and ligand here? Because when the complex dissociates, each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA. So if the complex is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

Let me denote the concentration of dissociated Ca²+ as x. So [Ca²+] = x. Since each complex gives one, the concentration of EDTA would also be x. But wait, because the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but when it dissociates, some converts into Ca²+ and EDTA. So the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But wait, if x is really small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02. Hmm, but given that K is a very large number (5e10), which is like a formation constant, it suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. That means x is really small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [Complex] ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the equation:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So:

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, so square root is sqrt(4)*1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Because 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute it numerically. 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this value.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}]}
\]

Since the complex dissociates in a 1:1 ratio, the concentration of the complex is approximately \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (assuming minimal dissociation due to the large \( K \)). Let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA} \) be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify \( 0.02 = 2 \times 10^{-2} \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
