Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the positions, probably on adjacent or diagonal carbons, but I think in adamantane, each position is a bridgehead, so 1 and 3 are across from each other.

Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base. I'm thinking elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination. So if each Br is on a bridgehead, removing two H's would form a double bond. Wait, but where? In adamantane, the structure has multiple bridgehead carbons. If we have Br on C1 and C3, maybe the elimination leads to forming a double bond between C1 and C2, or maybe C2 and C3? No, wait, elimination usually forms a double bond between adjacent carbons. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So, the structure is such that each carbon is connected to three others, if I'm not mistaken. So, when KOH is used, perhaps two E2 eliminations happen, removing two HBr molecules, and forming a double bond. But wait, there are two Br atoms, so maybe two eliminations occur, each removing HBr. So, the product would be an adamantane derivative with two double bonds?

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet for two hydrogens. Could that be an -O- group? Like maybe an epoxide? Or perhaps an ether. But wait, the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's around the carbonyl region, so maybe a ketone or an ester? Hmm, but 4.79 is more upfield for an oxygenated group, like an ether or an epoxide.

Wait, another thought. If two dehydrohalogenations happen, perhaps it forms an allene (a conjugated diene?), but that's less likely if the structure isn't conducive. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form a bridged bicyclic structure with a double bond. Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 4.79. Wait, no, the first peak is 4.79 (2H, maybe a triplet?), but wait the description says 4.79(2H). The splitting isn't given, so maybe it's a singlet because adjacent to something that doesn't split. Alternatively, perhaps the 2H are part of an epoxide. Let me think about the reaction again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. If it's a dehydrohalogenation, each Br would lose HBr, and form a double bond. But since it's 1,3, the two double bonds might be on either end. Wait, but if each elimination is on adjacent carbons, perhaps a conjugated diene forms. Alternatively, maybe a bridgehead double bond. Oh wait
