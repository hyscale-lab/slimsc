Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix and its geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. I think for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of Bloch vectors. The Bloch sphere comes into play here, right?

So, the general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). Each component of r corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z.

Let me write down the Pauli matrices to get a clearer picture.

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding those gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So when multiplied by 1/2, ρ becomes [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. That's the maximally mixed state.

Wait, but when I compare this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, substituting I gives ρ = [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ]]. But in our case, ρ is [[½, 0], [0, ½]]. So, let's set those equal.

So, (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

The off-diagonal terms in our ρ are zero. So (r_x -i r_y)/2 =0 and (r_x +i r_y)/2 =0. These conditions imply that r_x=0 and r_y=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That puts the state at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense for a maximally mixed state because it's completely depolarized and has no coherence. So the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center point (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. The components of \( \mathbf{r} \) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

For the given density matrix, the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal. Comparing this to the general form, we find:

- \( r_z = 0 \) (from the diagonal terms),
- \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \) (from the off-diagonal terms).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence or polarization. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not on the surface of the Bloch sphere.**  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as the z-component is zero.**  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not on the surface of the Bloch sphere.**

Answer: C
