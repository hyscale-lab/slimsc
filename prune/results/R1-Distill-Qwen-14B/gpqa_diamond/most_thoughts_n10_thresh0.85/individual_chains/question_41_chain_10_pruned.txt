Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when a medium like glass is moving, it affects how light propagates through it, but I'm not exactly sure how.

The setup is a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light relative to the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which is probably to make the math easier.

I think I need to use the concept of relative velocity here. But wait, light's speed isn't just additive like regular velocities because it's massless and moves at c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, but the glass is moving, so the light inside is in a different frame, right?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's frame, how would the light's speed be perceived?

In a stationary glass, the speed of light is v_light = c/n. Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium. So if n=1, it's in vacuum, and when the medium moves, this would change.

But if the glass is moving, do we add the velocities? Or is it more complicated because light's speed is always c in any frame? Wait, but the glass is moving relative to the lab
