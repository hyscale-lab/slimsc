--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about cobalt ions and thiocyanate forming complexes, and finding the percentage of a particular complex.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex.

Wait, stability constants... right, each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4. But wait, the order of β's might be a bit tricky. Wait, the stability constant increases with each added ligand, but sometimes there can be a maximum and then it might decrease. Here, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, so β3 is the highest, meaning Co(SCN)_3 is the most stable, followed by β2, then β1, then β4 is lower. Hmm, that seems a bit odd, but okay.

The question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2. So I need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form of Co(SCN)_2.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The general approach here is to use the concept of formation of each complex step by step, considering the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

So, first, let's define the complexes. Let me denote:

Co(H2O)6^2+ as Co^2+ (the free ion)
Co(SCN)_1 as the first complex,
Co(SCN)_2 as the second,
Co(SCN)_3 as the third,
and Co(SCN)_4 as the fourth.

The total concentration of all cobalt species is c_total = 1e-2 M. The total of all the species (all the complexes plus the free ion) should add up to c_total.

The concentration of each species can be found using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, the stability constant (β) is defined as [CoL^n]/([Co][L]^n), where L is the ligand. For each complex, the formation depends on the previous one.

So, for example, the concentration of Co(SCN)_1 is [Co^2+][SCN^-] * β1.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = [Co(SCN)_1][SCN^-] * β2 / β1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Each successive complex is formed by adding another SCN^- to the previous one. So, let's model it step by step.

Let me denote the concentrations as [C1], [C2], [C3], [C4], where Cn is the complex with n SCN^- ions.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process. So, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the previous one and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the concentration of each complex is:

[Cn] = [C_{n-1}] * [SCN^-] * βn / β_{n-1} ?

Wait, no. Alternatively, another approach is to model the formation using the successive addition of ligands. The fraction of each complex can be determined using the ratio of the successive stability constants multiplied by the ligand concentration ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the species distribution using the fraction of each complex.

Let me think about the distribution of the complexes. The fraction of each complex depends on the ratio of the successive β's multiplied by the ligand concentration.

Wait, yes, I remember that the fraction of a complex can be found using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach is to assume that the predominant species is the one with the highest β multiplied by [SCN]^n.

But since the β values are given, perhaps I can calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the most stable one, or relative to each other.

Let me think about the distribution. The fraction of each complex can be determined based on the product of the ligand concentrations and the stability constants.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by:

fn = (βn [SCN]^n) / (Σ (βk [SCN]^k)) for k from 0 to 4

Wait, but what's [Co] in this context? Because the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is [Co] = [Co^2+] + [C1] + [C2] + [C3] + [C4] = 1e-2 M.

But each [Cn] can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the βs.

Let me think: [C1] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]

[C2] = β2 [C1] [SCN^-] = β2 β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

Similarly, [C3] = β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

Wait, no, because β2 is the constant for the second ligand addition. Alternatively, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 is β1 * β2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the stepwise formation.

Wait, I think each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co(SCN)][SCN])

Similarly for β3 and β4.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN]

But [Co(SCN)] is β1 [Co][SCN]

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * β1 [Co][SCN]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * β2 * β1 [Co][SCN]^3

And [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 [Co][SCN]^4

But that might complicate things, as the higher complexes would have higher exponents on [SCN].

Wait, but the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M.

So, let's denote the concentration of free Co^2+ as x.

Then, [C1] = β1 * x * 0.1

[C2] = β1 * β2 * x * (0.1)^2

[C3] = β1 * β2 * β3 * x * (0.1)^3

[C4] = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * x * (0.1)^4

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because each step adds another SCN, so the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2.

Hmm, but in the problem statement, the β values are given as β1, β2, etc., which are the stepwise constants. So each successive β is for adding another ligand.

So, the concentration of Co(SCN)_n would be [Co]^free multiplied by the product of β1 to βn and (SCN^-)^n.

So, [Cn] = (β1 β2 β3 ... βn) [Co]^free (SCN^-)^n

But wait, that's a lot of multiplication for each n. Let's think for each n:

n=0: [Co^2+] = x

n=1: [C1] = β1 x [SCN^-]

n=2: [C2] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2

n=3: [C3] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3

n=4: [C4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4

So the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these:

x + β1 x [SCN] + β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = c_total = 1e-2 M

So, x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ) = 1e-2

We can factor x out and solve for x.

Let me compute the terms step by step.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

[SCN] =0.1 M = 1e-1

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3

Calculate that: 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680; (0.1)^3=1e-3 → 22680 *1e-3=22.68

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4

Compute:

9*40=360

360 *63=22680

22680 *16=362880

(0.1)^4=1e-4 → 362880 *1e-4=36.288

So now, adding all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9

+3.6 → 5.5

+22.68 →28.18

+36.288 →64.468

So the sum inside the brackets is 64.468.

So, x *64.468 = 1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M

So, x is about 1.551e-4 M. That's [Co^2+].

Now, we can compute each [Cn]:

[C1]=9 * x *0.1 =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1=9*1.551e-5 → 1.3959e-4 M

[C2]=9*40 *x*(0.1)^2= 9*40 *1.551e-4 *0.01

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute each [Cn] step by step.

Alternatively, using the expression [Cn]=β1*β2*...*βn * x * [SCN]^n

So for n=1: [C1] = β1 x [SCN] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1= 9 *1.551e-5= 1.3959e-4 M

n=2: [C2]= β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = 9*40 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2

9*40=360; 360 *1.551e-4=0.055836; then *0.01=0.00055836 → 5.5836e-4 M

n=3: [C3] =9*40*63 *x*(0.1)^3

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680 → 22680 *1.551e-4 = let's see:

22680 *1.551e-4 = 22680 * 0.0001551= ?

Wait, 22680 *0.0001=2.268, 22680 *0.0000551= approx 22680 *5.51e-5 → 22680 *5.51e-5 = (22680 *5.51) *1e-5

5.51 *22680 → let's compute 22680 *5 =113400, 22680 *0.51=11578.8 → total 124,978.8 → 124978.8e-5 =1.249788

So total 2.268 +1.249788=3.517788. Then multiply by (0.1)^3=1e-3 → 3.517788e-3 → 0.003517788 M

Wait, wait, no. Wait, [C3] would be 9*40*63 * x * (0.1)^3. So:

Calculate 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

Then, 22680 *x =22680 *1.551e-4= ?

22680 *1.551e-4 = (22680 *1.551) *1e-4.

Compute 22680 *1.551.

Well, 22680 *1 =22680

22680 *0.5 =11340 → 22680 *0.55 = 22680*(0.5 +0.05) =11340 +1134=12474

22680 *0.001=22.68

Wait, 1.551 is 1 +0.5 +0.05 +0.001.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 1.551 =1.5 +0.051.

22680 *1.5=34020.

22680 *0.051=22680 *0.05=1134, plus 22680 *0.001=22.68 → total 1134 +22.68=1156.68.

So 34020 +1156.68=35176.68.

Multiply by 1e-4: 35176.68e-4 = 3.517668.

Now multiply by (0.1)^3 =1e-3 → 3.517668e-3 =0.003517668 M.

So [C3]≈0.003517668 M.

n=4: [C4] =9*40*63*16 *x*(0.1)^4.

Compute the product of the betas: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

Multiply by x: 362880 *1.551e-4 = ?

362880 *1.551e-4 = (362880 *1.551) *1e-4.

Compute 362880 *1.551:

Well, 362880 *1 =362,880.

362880 *0.5 =181,440.

362880 *0.05=18,144.

362880 *0.001=362.88.

Adding them up: 362,880 +181,440=544,320; 544,320 +18,144=562,464; +362.88=562,826.88.

Multiply by 1e-4: 562,826.88 *1e-4 =56.282688.

Now multiply by (0.1)^4=1e-4: 56.282688 *1e-4 =0.0056282688 M.

Wait, no. Wait, the (0.1)^4 is 1e-4, so 56.282688 *1e-4 =0.0056282688 M.

So [C4]≈0.005628 M.

Wait, let me recap the concentrations:

[Co^2+] (x) =1.551e-4 M.

[C1]=1.3959e-4 M.

[C2]=5.5836e-4 M.

[C3]=0.003517668 M.

[C4]=0.005628 M.

Let me sum all these to check if they add up to 1e-2 M.

x=1.551e-4 ≈0.0001551

[C1]=0.00013959

[C2]=0.00055836

[C3]=0.003517668

[C4]=0.005628

Adding them up:

0.0001551 +0.00013959 =0.00029469

+0.00055836 → 0.00085305

+0.003517668 →0.004370718

+0.005628 →0.009998718, which is approximately 0.01 M. So that checks out.

So, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think that's [C2], the Co(SCN)_2 complex.

But wait, sometimes the blue color is associated with Co(SCN)_2, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I've heard that Co(SCN)_2 is blue, Co(SCN)_3 is green, and Co(SCN)_4 is brown. So, the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2.

So, [C2] is 5.5836e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M.

The fraction is [C2]/(total) = (5.5836e-4) / (0.01) =0.055836, which is 5.5836%.

Wait, but that's about 5.6%, which isn't one of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the β's. Let me double-check the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the stepwise formation is different. Maybe the way I calculated [C2] is incorrect. Let me think again about the [Cn] expressions.

Wait, each [Cn] is (β1 β2 ... βn) * x * [SCN]^n.

Wait, that's correct. Because each step adds another ligand, so the product of the β's up to n gives the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So for [C1], it's β1 x [SCN].

For [C2], β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Wait, but wait. The way β works is that for each additional ligand, you multiply by the next β. So [C2] = β2 [C1][SCN] = β2*β1 x [SCN]^2.

Yes, so that part was correct.

But the options don't show 5.6% as an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the [C2] concentration.

Wait, let me recompute [C2]:

[C2] = β1 * β2 * x * (SCN)^2.

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40 → 9*40=360.

x=1.551e-4 M.

(0.1)^2=0.01.

So [C2]=360 *1.551e-4 *0.01.

Let me compute 360 *1.551e-4 first.

360 *1.551e-4 = (360 *1.551) *1e-4.

Compute 360 *1.551:

360 *1 =360.

360 *0.5 =180.

360 *0.05=18.

360 *0.001=0.36.

So 1.551 =1 +0.5 +0.05 +0.001.

So 360*(1 +0.5 +0.05 +0.001) = 360 +180 +18 +0.36 = 558.36.

Multiply by 1e-4 → 558.36e-4 =0.055836.

Now multiply by 0.01 (from (0.1)^2) → 0.055836 *0.01 =0.00055836 M.

So [C2] is 0.00055836 M.

So [C2]=5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's 0.00055836 M.

Hmm, so as a percentage of the total 0.01 M, that's (5.5836e-4)/(1e-2) ) *100= (0.055836)*100=5.5836%.

That's about 5.6%, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given as log β or something else? No, the problem states they're stability constants β1=9, etc.

Wait, maybe the β's are for the overall formation, not stepwise. Let me think. No, the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc.' So I think they're stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all complexes with two SCN ligands, but wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, so n=2 would be the dithiocyanato complex.

Hmm, perhaps I've missed something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the sum for x is incorrect. Let me go back. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all [Cn].

Wait, another approach: the sum is:

x + β1 x [SCN] + β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = c_total = 1e-2.

So, x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ) = 1e-2.

Earlier, I computed each term as follows:

Term1:1

Term2:9*0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9

Term3:9*40*(0.1)^2= 360*0.01=3.6 → sum=5.5

Term4:9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68 → sum=28.18

Term5:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 *1e-4=36.288 → sum=64.468.

So the sum is 64.468, correct.

x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M. Correct.

So, the calculation of x is correct.

So then, [C2]= (9 *40) * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 *1.551e-4 *0.01 = 360 *1.551e-6 = 5.5836e-4 M.

So, [C2]=5.5836e-4 M.

So, the fraction is [C2]/c_total = (5.5836e-4) / (1e-2) ) = 0.055836, which is 5.58% approx.

But none of the options are close to that. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.

So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Maybe I should consider that the formation constants are given for the overall complex, not stepwise.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the βn is the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n.

In that case, the formation constants would be:

β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co][SCN]^2)

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3] / ([Co][SCN]^3)

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4] / ([Co][SCN]^4)

Wait, that's different. So in this case, [Cn] = βn x [SCN]^n.

If that's the case, then the approach changes.

Let me try that.

So, with this scenario:

[C1] = β1 x [SCN] =9 * x *0.1.

[C2]=β2 x [SCN]^2=40 *x*(0.1)^2.

[C3]=63 *x*(0.1)^3.

[C4]=16 *x*(0.1)^4.

The total cobalt is x + [C1] + [C2] + [C3] + [C4] = 1e-2.

So, substituting:

x +9 *x*0.1 +40 x (0.01) +63 x (0.001) +16 x (0.0001) =1e-2.

Compute each term:

x =x.

9x*0.1=0.9x.

40x *0.01=0.4x.

63x *0.001=0.063x.

16x *0.0001=0.0016x.

Sum: x (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) ) = x (2.3646) =1e-2.

So x= (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈ 4.228e-3 M.

Wait, that's higher than before. So, let's compute each [Cn]:

[C1]=9 *4.228e-3 *0.1 =9 *4.228e-4=3.805e-3 M.

[C2]=40 *4.228e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.228e-3 *0.01=40 *4.228e-5=1.691e-3 M.

[C3]=63 *4.228e-3 * (0.1)^3=63 *4.228e-3 * 0.001=63 *4.228e-6=2.66484e-4 M.

[C4]=16 *4.228e-3 * (0.1)^4=16 *4.228e-3 *1e-4=16 *4.228e-7=6.7648e-6 M.

Now, sum all:

x=4.228e-3≈0.004228

[C1]=0.003805 → total 0.008033.

[C2]=0.001691 → 0.009724.

[C3]=0.000266 → 0.00999.

[C4]=0.00000676 → ~0.00999676, which is about 0.01 M, correct.

So, [C2] is 0.001691 M.

As a percentage of the total 0.01 M, that's (0.001691 / 0.01 ) *100 = 16.91%.

Which is approximately 16.9%, option D.

Ah, so that's the answer. So the mistake was assuming that the β's are stepwise when in reality they are overall formation constants.

Wait, but the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.'

Wait, the definition of βn for the nth complex is the overall stability constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. So, βn = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So, if the problem gives βn as the stepwise constants, then the overall for n=2 would be β1*β2.

But in the first approach, I used stepwise and calculated the sum as 64.468, which led to a [C2] of about 5.6%, which isn't an option.

In the second approach, I treated each βn as the overall constant for the nth complex, which led to [C2]=16.9%, option D.

But the problem's β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc. So, which is correct?

Hmm, I think the problem states they are the stability constants for each complex, so β1 is the overall for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc. So in that case, the approach where [Cn] = βn x [SCN]^n is correct.

Because when it says 'stability constants', each βn refers to the nth complex.

So in that case, the correct approach is the second one, leading to [C2] of ~16.9%, which is option D.

So, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants (\( \beta \)) for the complexes are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Key Assumptions and Approach
1. **Stability Constants**: The given \( \beta \) values are interpreted as the overall stability constants for the respective complexes:
   - \( \beta_1 \): \( \text{Co(SCN)} \)
   - \( \beta_2 \): \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2 \)
   - \( \beta_3 \): \( \text{Co(SCN)}_3 \)
   - \( \beta_4 \): \( \text{Co(SCN)}_4 \)

2. **Concentration of Each Complex**: The concentration of each cobalt complex is expressed as:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   where \( [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \) is the concentration of free \( \text{Co}^{2+} \) ions.

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} + [\text{Co(SCN)}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Calculation of Free Cobalt (\( [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \))**: Using the expressions for each complex, the total cobalt concentration is rewritten in terms of \( [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \):
   \[
   [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right) = 10^{-2}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \left( 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 \right) = 10^{-2}.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( 1 = 1 \)
   - \( 9(0.1) = 0.9 \)
   - \( 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4 \)
   - \( 63(0.1)^3 = 63(0.001) = 0.063 \)
   - \( 16(0.1)^4 = 16(0.0001) = 0.0016 \)
   Summing these:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]
   Solving for \( [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} \):
   \[
   [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentration of \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2 \)**: Using the formula for \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] \):
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}]^{\text{free}} [\text{SCN}^-]^2.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 40 \cdot 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01.
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 40 \cdot 4.228 \times 10^{-5} = 1.691 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2 \)**: The percentage of \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2 \) is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{c_{\text{total}}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.691 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \right) \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.
