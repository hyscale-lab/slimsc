Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titration. Hmm, let me read the question again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to break this down step by step. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Original volume (V1) is 20 cm³, and the original concentration (M1) is 0.05 M. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume (V2) becomes 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that: 1 / 40 is 0.025. Wait, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH.

Let me find the moles of acetic acid initially. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Moles = M * V (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So original acetic acid moles were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, it's the same moles, 0.001 mol in 0.04 L, which is 0.025 M.

So for the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. At 25%, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So that's 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the moles needed. Because 25% titration could mean 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 10 cm³ is the equivalence volume. So 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So let's first calculate the pH at
