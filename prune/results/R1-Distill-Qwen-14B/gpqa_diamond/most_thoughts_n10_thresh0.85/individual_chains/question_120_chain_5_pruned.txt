Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed usually implies that the number density is constant in space. But here, the distribution is in terms of parallax. So how does the number of stars per unit parallax depend on plx?

I think I should model this. Let's see, the number of stars in a certain volume would be proportional to the volume if they're uniformly distributed. But wait, the question is about number per unit range of parallax. So maybe I should consider how the volume changes with parallax.

Let's think in terms of spherical shells. Each shell at a certain distance would have a certain thickness. Wait, but parallax is inversely related to distance. So for a small change in parallax, how does the corresponding distance change?

Parallax plx = 1/d, so if plx increases by some amount, d decreases. The change in d with plx is d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). Hmm, not sure if I need that yet.

I think the key is to find the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's denote the number of stars as N, and the range of parallax as Δplx. So the number per unit parallax would be N/(Δplx).

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, say n. So the total number in a volume element dV would be n*dV.

Now, I need to relate dV to a change in parallax. Let's consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² * dd. But we need to express dd in terms of plx and Δplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd = -d² * (dplx) (taking the derivative of d with respect to plx). Wait, let's compute that properly.

Differentiate d = 1/plx with respect to plx:

dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2)

So dd = (-1/(plx^2)) * dplx.

But I'm looking at a small range in plx, Δplx. So the corresponding change in d is Δd = (-1/(plx^2)) * Δplx.

Wait, but the shell's volume is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, d² = 1/(plx^2). And dd is ( -1/(plx^2) ) * Δplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π*(1/(plx^2)) * ( -1/(plx^2) * Δplx ). Wait, that would give 4π * (1/(plx^2)) *
