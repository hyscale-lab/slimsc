Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's rotation and vibration. Hmm, I remember that molecules can be modeled using different quantum models, and this one is the rotation-vibration or non-rigid rotor model. The question is about the photon momentum needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But what kind of transition are we talking about here? Is it a pure rotational transition, a vibrational one, or a combination?

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, I guess the bond length isn't fixed, so maybe it's considering both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, no—the non-rigid rotor model might refer to a rotor that accounts for centrifugal distortion, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the problem says the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The energy states are a combination of both, right? So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

In the ground state (fundamental state), the molecule has the lowest possible rotational and vibrational energies. So the vibrational quantum number ν is 0, and the rotational quantum number J is 0 as well. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state?

I think that in such transitions, the molecule can either increase its rotational state or vibrational state. But according to the selection rules for diatomic molecules, the vibrational transitions are usually ν → ν+1, but the rotational transitions can change by ΔJ = ±1, similar to the rigid rotor.

Wait, but in the problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state. So its initial state is (J=0, ν=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state, which could be either the first rotational state (J=1, ν=0) or the first vibrational state (J=0, ν=1). Which one has lower energy?

Hmm, I need to compare the energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (ν + 1/2)ħω, and rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is μr², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length. So let's calculate that.

Given:
Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

First, compute the reduced mass μ. The formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So plugging in the numbers:

Mx + My = 20 + 2 = 22 amu.
μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

I = μ * R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's calculate that:

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, the vibrational energy for ν=0 is E_vib = (0 + 1/2)ħω. The rotational energy for J=0 is E_rot = 0, since J(J+1) would be 0*(0+1)=0. So the initial energy is (1/2)ħω.

If the molecule absorbs a photon and goes to the next state, what is the next possible state? The next state could be either J=1, ν=0, or J=0, ν=1. Which requires less energy? Let's compute both possibilities.

Energy for (J=1, ν=0): E_rot = (1*2) ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). And E_vib remains (1/2)ħω. So total E = (1/2)ħω + ħ²/(I).

Energy for (J=0, ν=1): E_rot is 0, E_vib is (1 + 1/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. So E = (3/2)ħω.

Which is lower? Let's compute both.

Compute E for J=1, ν=0:

Calculate ħ²/(I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ħ² ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

E_vib is (1/2) ħω: ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J. Half of that is 2.109e-20 J.

Total E_rot + E_vib = 9.22e-23 + 2.109e-20 ≈ 2.19e-20 J.

Wait, wait. No, correction: The energy for J=1 is (J(J+1)) * ħ²/(2I). So for J=1: 1*2=2. So E_rot is 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I) = 9.22e-23 J. And E_vib is (1/2)ħω = 2.109e-20 J. So total is 2.109e-20 + 9.22e-23 = approx 2.19e-20 J.

Now, E for J=0, ν=1: E_vib is (3/2)ħω = 3 * 2.109e-20 /2 = 3 * 1.0545e-20 ≈ 3.163e-20 J.

So comparing 2.19e-20 J (J=1, ν=0) vs 3.163e-20 J (J=0, ν=1). The first is lower. So the molecule would transition to J=1, ν=0, which is a rotational transition.

So the energy difference is the energy of the photon needed. The initial energy is E_initial = (1/2)ħω. The final energy is E_final = (1/2)ħω + ħ²/I. So ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħ²/(I).

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. Initial state is (J=0, ν=0): E_initial = E_rot (J=0) + E_vib (ν=0) = 0 + (1/2)ħω = 0.5 ħω.

Final state after transition is (J=1, ν=0): E_final = E_rot (J=1) + E_vib (ν=0) = (1/2ħ²)/(I) * 2 (since J=1: J(J+1)=2, so E_rot = 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). Plus E_vib is still (1/2) ħω. So E_final = ħ²/I + 0.5 ħω.

So ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ħ²/I + 0.5 ħω] - [0.5 ħω] = ħ²/I.

So the photon's energy must be ħ²/I.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the transition is from J=0, ν=0 to J=0, ν=1, the energy difference would be ΔE = (3/2 ħω) - (1/2 ħω) )= ħω. But as we saw earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy: ħ²/I = 9.22e-23 J vs ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J. So 9.22e-23 J is less than 4.218e-20 J. Hence, the rotational transition is lower in energy.

So the photon needed is for ΔE = ħ²/I.

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, energy levels are spaced as (ħ²/(2I)) multiplied by J(J+1). So the spacing between levels J and J+1 is from (J(J+1)) to (J+1)(J+2). The difference is ΔE_rot = (J+1)(J+2) ħ²/(2I) - J(J+1) ħ²/(2I) = [ (J+1)(J+2 - J) ) ] * ħ²/(2I) = (J+1)(2) * ħ²/(2I) )= (J+1) ħ²/(I).

Wait, no, let me compute the exact difference. For J=0 to J=1: E(J=1) - E(J=0) = (2) ħ²/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/I. So yes, the energy difference is ħ²/I.

So the photon's energy must be ħ²/I.

But photons have energy E_photon = h ν_photon = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. Wait, no, E = pc for photons because their mass is zero. So E_photon = p c. That is, p = E_photon / c.

So the energy of the photon is ΔE = ħ²/I.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the photon's energy is h ν, where ν is the frequency. Alternatively, since E = pc, the momentum p is E/c = (h ν)/c = (h / (c)) ν. But in terms of angular frequency ω, since ω = 2π ν, then E = ħ ω. So E_photon = ħ ω_photon.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let's clarify:

Photon energy E_photon = h ν = ħ ω, where ω is angular frequency. And since E = pc for photons, p = E_photon / c = (ħ ω) / c.

So if the photon's energy is ΔE = ħ² / I, then p_photon = (ΔE) / c = (ħ² / I) / c.

Wait, but wait. The energy required for the transition is ΔE = ħ² / I, so the photon's energy must match that. So E_photon = ΔE = ħ²/I.

Thus, p_photon = E_photon / c = (ħ²/(I)) / c.

So let's compute that.

First, compute ħ² / I:

We already have ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.113e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.225e-23 J.

Then, E_photon = 9.225e-23 J.

To find p_photon, divide by c (speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s).

p_photon = 9.225e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.075e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units are correct.

Wait, 3.075e-31 kg·m/s is 3.075e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are in that range. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the transition wrong. Maybe the next state is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. Because maybe the energy required for the rotational transition is lower, but perhaps the problem says the molecule is modeled via rotation-vibration, so perhaps the transition is a vibrational one.

Wait, let's re-examine. The question says: what momentum should an absorbed photon have, so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The next state with the lowest energy is the one that requires the least energy to reach from the initial state. So we have two possibilities: transition to J=1, ν=0 (ΔE_rot = ħ²/I) or transition to J=0, ν=1 (ΔE_vib = ħ ω).

We need to compare these two energies to see which is smaller, because the question is asking for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Compute ħ²/I:

I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68 J²·s².

ħ²/I = 1.113e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.225e-23 J.

Compute ħ ω: ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ ω = 1.055e-34 *4e14 = 4.22e-20 J.

Comparing 9.225e-23 J (rotational) and 4.22e-20 J (vibrational), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon needed is 9.225e-23 J.

But when I compute the momentum, I get p_photon = E/c = 9.225e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.075e-31 N·s. But none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, the mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that exactly:

1.818 * 1.6605 = approximately 3.015 (because 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, 0.018*1.66 is ~0.03, so total ~3.018).

So μ = 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ²/I: ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05)^2 = 1.1025, so 1.1025e-68 (but precise calculation: 1.05457e-34 squared is (approx) (1.05457)^2 = 1.1123, so 1.1123e-68 J²s²).

So ħ²/I = 1.1123e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approximately 9.214e-23 J.

Then E_photon = 9.214e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.214e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.071e-31 kg·m/s = 3.071e-31 N·s.

Looking at the options, the smallest is option D:1.4e-28 Ns, which is much larger than 3e-31. Hmm, so maybe I'm way off.

Wait a minute, perhaps I have to consider the vibrational transition instead. Because maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed, or perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts. So when you make a transition, you can change either J or ν, or both. But the selection rules usually allow for ΔJ=±1 and Δν=±1 for vibrational transitions, but sometimes vibrational transitions can involve ΔJ as well.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition in either vibration or rotation. But the question is to find which photon allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy difference, which as calculated earlier, is the rotational transition.

But this gives a p_photon of 3e-31 Ns, but none of the options are near that. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next energy level, which is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. Because maybe the rotational energy spacing is smaller than the vibrational one, but in this case, the rotational transition is less energetic than the vibrational.

Wait, but the vibrational transition requires more energy. So if the photon has enough energy to cause a vibrational transition, but perhaps the problem is asking for the transition where the molecule goes to the next state, which may involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy difference between the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0) and the next state, which could be the first vibrational state (ν=1, J=0). The energy difference is ΔE = E_vib(ν=1) - E_vib(ν=0) = (3/2 ħω) - (1/2 ħω) )= ħω.

So E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is p=1.4e-28 Ns. Hmm, that's matching.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why are we considering the vibrational transition?

Ah, perhaps because in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the transitions typically involve a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but perhaps the problem is simply asking for the photon that causes a transition to the next state, which is the lowest energy, which would be the vibrational transition, because E_photon for that is higher than the rotational transition, but perhaps I'm missing something in the model.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest possible. The next state with the lowest energy is the one that is just one quantum higher than the fundamental. So, it would be the first excited state. The energy levels in a diatomic molecule are usually a combination of vibrational and rotational states. The order of the energy levels can be such that some rotational states are higher than certain vibrational states.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the next state is the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever is lower. But in this case, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, but that leads to a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from the ground state (J=0, ν=0) to the next state (J=1, ν=0), which would require a rotational photon.

But in that case, the energy is E_rot = (1*(1+1))ħ²/(2I) - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ² / I.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = 1.05457e-34^2 / (1.207e-46) as before.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². Then, I = μ R² = (3.015e-27 kg) * 4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg·m². So that part is correct.

So E_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.206e-46 = (1.112e-68) / 1.206e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

Then, E_photon = 9.22e-23 J. So p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So way off.

So perhaps the photon is a vibrational one. Let's compute that.

E_photon_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon_vib = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But earlier calculation said that the rotational transition requires less energy, so it would be the next state. But perhaps in reality, the vibrational transitions are the dominant ones when considering the overall state transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering just the vibrational transition. Because the rotational transition would require a much lower energy, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational parts. The next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state, which could involve either a change in J or ν.

So the possible transitions are:

1. J=0, ν=0 → J=1, ν=0 (rotational)
2. J=0, ν=0 → J=0, ν=1 (vibrational)
3. J=0, ν=0 → J=1, ν=1 (rotational and vibrational)

But which of these has the lowest energy?

Compute the energy for each:

Case 1: J=1, ν=0.

E = E_rot + E_vib = (1*(1+1)ħ²/(2I)) + (0 + 1/2)ħω.

E_rot = (2)ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I) ≈9.22e-23 J.

E_vib = (1/2)ħω = 2.109e-20 J.

Total E1 = 9.22e-23 + 2.109e-20 ≈ 2.19e-20 J.

Case 2: J=0, ν=1.

E_rot = 0.

E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħω = 3/2 * ħω = 3 * 2.109e-20 /2 = 3.163e-20 J.

Case3: J=1, ν=1.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) =9.22e-23 J.

E_vib = (1 +1/2) ħω =3.163e-20 J.

Total E3 = 3.163e-20 +9.22e-23 ≈3.255e-20 J.

So the energies are:

E1: 2.19e-20 J (J=1, ν=0)

E2:3.163e-20 J (J=0, ν=1)

E3:3.255e-20 J (J=1, ν=1)

The next state with the lowest energy is E1, which is 2.19e-20 J.

But the energy difference from the initial state (E0= (1/2) ħω =2.109e-20 J) is E1-E0 = (2.19e-20 - 2.109e-20 )= 8.1e-23 J. Wait, no, E0 is 2.109e-20 J, E1 is 2.19e-20 J. So ΔE = 2.19e-20 - 2.109e-20 = 8.1e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right because E_rot for J=1 is 9.22e-23 J, and E_vib is 2.109e-20 J.

Wait, no, E0 is (J=0, ν=0): E_rot=0, E_vib= (0.5) ħω=2.109e-20 J.

E1 is (J=1, ν=0): E_rot=9.22e-23 J, E_vib=2.109e-20 J. So E1 = 9.22e-23 +2.109e-20 = approx 2.19e-20 J.

So E1-E0 = 2.19e-20 - 2.109e-20 = 8.1e-23 J.

Wait, but E0 is 2.109e-20 J, and E1 is higher by 8.1e-23 J. But earlier when I thought the rotational transition required 9.22e-23 J, that was the E_rot part, but in reality, the total energy includes adding the E_vib which is already part of E0.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the energy difference between the initial state and each possible next state, and choose the one with the smallest ΔE.

So initial state: (J=0, ν=0) → E0 = 2.109e-20 J.

Possible next states:

1. (J=1, ν=0): E1 =9.22e-23 + 2.109e-20 = 2.19e-20 J → ΔE= 8.1e-23 J.

2. (J=0, ν=1): E2 =3.163e-20 J → ΔE=3.163e-20 -2.109e-20 = 1.054e-20 J.

3. (J=1, ν=1): E3=9.22e-23 +3.163e-20 =3.255e-20 J → ΔE=3.255e-20 -2.109e-20=1.146e-20 J.

So the smallest ΔE is 8.1e-23 J (case 1). So the photon's energy should be 8.1e-23 J.

But calculating p_photon=8.1e-23 J /3e8 m/s =2.7e-31 Ns. Still way smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy difference.

Wait, E0 =2.109e-20 J.

E1 = 9.22e-23 +2.109e-20 =2.19e-20 J.

ΔE1= E1 - E0 = 2.19e-20 - 2.109e-20 = 8.1e-23 J.

p_photon = 8.1e-23 /3e8 =2.7e-31 Ns.

Again, no matching option.

But wait, another approach: maybe the question is considering the molecule being in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state (J=0). Then, the next energy level would be the first vibrational level (ν=1), which would require a photon with energy ħω.

Because in some models, the transition to the next state is the first vibrational excitation, even though it's higher in energy than a rotational transition.

So, if the photon's energy is ħω, p_photon= ħω/c.

Compute that:

ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14=4.218e-20 J.

p_photon=4.218e-20 /3e8= 1.406e-28 Ns.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the question assumes that the next state is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

But why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so it would be the next state. But perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the molecule's energy is considered as a combination, but the next state is a vibrational one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recheck the reduced mass:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct calculation for the rotational transition leads to a momentum of 3e-31 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended path is to take the vibrational transition.

So the correct answer would be option D:1.4e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the ground state, where both the vibrational quantum number \( \nu = 0 \) and the rotational quantum number \( J = 0 \). The goal is to find the photon momentum that corresponds to the energy difference for the smallest possible transition.

### Key Parameters:
- Mass of atom \( X \): \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom \( Y \): \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Reduced Mass:
The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Moment of Inertia:
The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

### Energy Levels:
1. **Rotational Energy**: The rotational energy is given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \), \( E_{\text{rot}} = 0 \). For \( J = 1 \), \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \).

2. **Vibrational Energy**: The vibrational energy is given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left( \nu + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar \omega.
   \]
   For \( \nu = 0 \), \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \). For \( \nu = 1 \), \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).

### Initial and Final States:
- **Initial State**: \( J = 0, \nu = 0 \), total energy \( E_0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \).
- **Possible Final States**:
  1. \( J = 1, \nu = 0 \): Total energy \( E_1 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} + \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \).
  2. \( J = 0, \nu = 1 \): Total energy \( E_2 = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).

### Energy Differences:
1. Transition to \( J = 1, \nu = 0 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. Transition to \( J = 0, \nu = 1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = E_2 - E_0 = \hbar \omega.
   \]
   Substituting \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison:
- \( \Delta E_1 = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) (rotational transition).
- \( \Delta E_2 = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \) (vibrational transition).

The rotational transition requires less energy, but none of the provided options match the calculated momentum for this transition. Instead, the vibrational transition corresponds to a photon momentum:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}.
\]
Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
\[
p = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The photon momentum required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), corresponding to option **D**.
