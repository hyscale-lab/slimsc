Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The question gives five stars, each with their own RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some extinction values. The key points are the V magnitudes each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 V mag, so that means it can detect stars with V mag <=17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so it can detect up to 16 mag.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says: for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Brighter than 17 would mean magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So, if a star is brighter (has a lower V mag), it's more easily detected. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <=16.

So the stars that both can detect must have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 16, because that's the brighter limit for HIRES, which is stricter than ESPRESSO's 17. Wait, but wait, because if a star is brighter than 17 (so, V <=17), it's visible to ESPRESSO. But HIRES can only see V <=16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to be brighter than 17 mag? No wait, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. So "brighter than 17" means V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16, which is V <16. So a star that is V=16.5 is too faint for HIRES but okay for ESPRESSO. Wait, no: because if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 (so, V=16 is brighter than 17), it's observable by ESPRESSO. For HIRES, stars brighter than
