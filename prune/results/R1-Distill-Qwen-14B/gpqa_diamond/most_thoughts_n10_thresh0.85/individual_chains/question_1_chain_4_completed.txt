Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ/(Δt2) = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So ΔE1 is about 7e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 7e-8 eV. 

The total uncertainty when considering the two states would be the sum of these individual uncertainties, I think. Because if both states have some energy spread, the minimum energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable. Wait, no, maybe it's the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the sum? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, ΔE should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because each state's energy isn't a single value but a range. So for them to be clearly resolved, the difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. 

Adding the two uncertainties: 7e-7 eV + 7e-8 eV = 7.7e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be larger than approximately 7.7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7, so not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no way.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 vs 7.7e-7. 1e-4 is bigger. So yes, this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Which is 1e-8, which is 0.0001 times 1e-6. So that's smaller than 7.7e-7. So D is not enough.

So the correct option is C. Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let's double-check.

Wait, calculating 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 s: 

1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J. Then converting to eV: 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-7 eV. Yes. 

Then, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times bigger than 1e-8. So 1e-4 is much larger than the required 7.7e-7.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For two states with lifetimes \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2}.
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \hbar \) to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}.
\]

For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this requirement with the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller, so this is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly resolve the two states.
