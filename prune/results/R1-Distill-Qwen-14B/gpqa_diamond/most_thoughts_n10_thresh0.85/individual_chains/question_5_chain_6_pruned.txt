Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my operator eigenvectors, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, Jx, Jy, Jz, they have specific matrix forms. And eigenstates can be found by solving the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> or something like that. Wait, wait. The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, n is a unit vector, right? So, any direction in x-z plane would mean that n has components (nx, 0, nz), and since it's arbitrary, I can probably parameterize it using an angle θ from the z-axis. So, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps?

But wait, the operator P is the angular momentum operator, I think. So, the operator along direction n would be P_n = n · P, where P is the vector of operators (Px, Py, Pz). So, P_n = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny =0, so P_n = nx Px + nz Pz.

Given that, the eigenvalue equation would be P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So the state |ψ> is an eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue ħ/2.

But wait, the operator P could be the spin operator, since we're dealing with a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So, the spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

Wait, looking back at the question, it says the operator is P. The X-component of P is given as (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,
