Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let me go through the information given.

Both planets are Earth-like and detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So, their minimum masses are known, but we don't have to worry about inclination here since RV gives us the minimum. Wait, but for transit probability, inclination is a big factor. Oh, right, because a transit occurs only if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us.

Wait, the RV method can't determine the inclination directly, but it gives a minimum mass. But for transit probability, it's more about the inclination. If the planet's orbit is more likely to be aligned, then the transit probability is higher.

The probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the orbital distance. The formula I remember is something like P = R_star / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5). Since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies to P = (R_star) / a. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.

The transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned within a certain range. Actually, the exact probability is given by (R_star / a) * (something about the angle). Oh right, the probability that the inclination is just right for a transit is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_star/a)^2)^0.5 ). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, the transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately (R_star / a)², no, wait: the actual formula is (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_star / a)^2 )^(-0.5). No, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think: the probability is the area where the planet's orbit is within the cone around our line of sight. The probability is (R_star / a)², but wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2)^-1), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else). Oh wait
