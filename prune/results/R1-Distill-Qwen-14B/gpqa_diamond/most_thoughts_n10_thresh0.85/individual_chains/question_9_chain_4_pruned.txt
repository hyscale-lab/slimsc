Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). Alternatively, it's the combination of C3 and a mirror plane. Wait, sometimes I get confused between C3h and D3h. Oh wait, no, C3h is a subgroup of D3h, right? So C3h has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, but not the other mirror planes that D3h has.

So the task is to find which of the given molecules has this C3h symmetry. The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about each molecule one by one.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. Its structure is (i-Pr)3B(OCH3)2, I think. Wait, triisopropylborate would have a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups and two OMe groups attached. Hmm, the structure is something like B with two OMe and three iPr groups. So how symmetric is that? The molecule would have the boron as the center. The three isopropyl groups are all the same, but the two OMe are in another position. Wait, but wait, I think the structure is more like B with three isopropyl substituents and two OMe groups attached. Wait, no, maybe it's (iPr)3B(OCH3)2. So that would be a borate with three isopropyl and two OMe groups.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure. Borate typically has a trigonal planar structure around boron. So, if three substituents are isopropyl and two are OMe, wait, that would be five substituents. No, wait, maybe the formula is (iPr)3B(OCH3)2. Wait, that would be five substituents, which doesn't make sense because boron usually has three bonds. Oh, I must have gotten that wrong. Maybe it's (iPr)3B(O-)2, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe it's (iPr)3BO(OCH3)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (iPr)3B(OCH3)2, but that would imply five substituents, which doesn't make sense for boron. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the boron has three substituents: three isopropyl groups. But that can't be because the
