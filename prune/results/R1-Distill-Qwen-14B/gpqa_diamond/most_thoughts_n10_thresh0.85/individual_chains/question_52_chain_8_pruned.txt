Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. When the star doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. This ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so the ratio N1/N2 (where N1 is level 1 and N2 is level 2) is observed to decrease when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Therefore, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_spots = factor.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (N1/N2)_spots < (N1/N2)_no_spots. So the factor would be (no spots ratio) / (spots ratio) = a number greater than 1. So the answer options are numbers like 1.1, 7.8, etc. The options given are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9. So the factor is probably one of these.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, because the transition is between these two levels, and the wavelength is given, perhaps I can find the energy difference from the wavelength. The energy E is related to the wavelength λ by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light. Oh wait, but E is the difference between the two levels. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, the energy difference for the transition from level 1 to level 2 is E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E2 - E1)/(k T) = - (hc)/(λ k T).

But wait, which level is higher in energy? Well, since the transition corresponds to emission or absorption at that wavelength, but for the Boltzmann factor, we're considering the excitation. So if the star emits light when an atom drops from level 2 to 1, then level 2 is higher in energy.

So the formula for the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (hc)/(λ k T) )

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So in the presence of spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, so when the spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. However, the problem is about the photosphere, which is the star's atmosphere. Wait, but the spots are on the surface, so when the spots are present, parts of the surface are cooler. But the question states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So the Teff of the entire photosphere is lower.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation applies to each region. But the star's surface is not all at the same temperature when spots are present. But the problem says that in the photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the average T is lower, but I'm not sure how that affects the ratio. Alternatively, maybe the problem
