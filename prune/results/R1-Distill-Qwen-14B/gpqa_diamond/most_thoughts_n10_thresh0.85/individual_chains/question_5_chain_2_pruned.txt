Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar when a linear operator is applied to them. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector gives (plus ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So that's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is given by some angle in the x-z plane. Wait, but n is arbitrary, so the operator P would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, in spherical coordinates, an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane would have an angle θ where θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So maybe the direction is given by angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π perhaps. Wait, let me think: if n is in the x-z plane, then the direction is determined by the polar angle θ from the z-axis and the azimuthal angle φ is either 0 or π, depending on which way you go. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, no. The direction in the x-z plane would have φ = 0 or φ = π, but for the purposes of the operator, maybe we can write P as a combination of P_x and P_z, since P_y would have zero component because n is in x-z. So the operator P would be P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) * something, but wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So for a general direction n in x-z, the operator would be P = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z. But since each P component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices, maybe we can represent P as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Or wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>. So the operator P has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, but how does this relate to the spin matrices? Oh, because for an electron (or muon, which is similar), the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. Wait, but here the operator is P, which I think is analogous to the spin operator. So P is similar to S, but let me confirm.

Wait, the operator is given as P, with components P_x, P_y, P_z. So I think P is an angular momentum operator, but for a spin-1/2 particle. So, the operator for the component along a direction n would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since in this case, n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0, so P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = (n_x) P_x + (n_z) P_z. So the eigenvalue equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, but each P component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So I can factor out ħ/2:

(n_x (σ_x) + n_z (σ_z)) * (ħ/2) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So the equation becomes (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |v> = |v>.

So the matrix for the operator is (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ), which is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Let me write this as:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 (since the equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |v> = |v> → (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |v> = 1 * |v> ).

So the eigenvector equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |v> = |v>.

To find the eigenvector, let's set up the equation (A - I) |v> = 0, where A is the matrix above and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (A - I) is [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1]].

The determinant of (A - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let's compute the determinant:

det(A - I) = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - n_x^2.

Expanding this: (n_z^2 + n_z - n_z -1) -n_x^2 → (n_z^2 -1) -n_x^2.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, because n is a unit vector, so n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2.

Substituting into the determinant: (1 -n_x^2 -1) -n_x^2 = (-n_x^2) -n_x^2 = -2n_x^2. So the determinant is -2n_x^2, which equals zero only when n_x=0. But n_x being zero would mean n is along the z-axis, which is a special case. But the problem says n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps this approach isn't the way to go, or maybe I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for the eigenvectors without going through the determinant. Let's think about the eigenvector equation:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0.

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

Which gives two equations:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0.

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

Let me write them as:

v1 (n_z - 1) + v2 n_x = 0 → equation (1)

v1 n_x + v2 (-n_z -1) =0 → equation (2)

Let me try to solve these equations. Let's express equation (1) as v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 ), assuming n_z ≠1.

Substituting into equation (2):

[ (-n_x v2) / (n_z -1) ) ] * n_x + v2 (-n_z -1 ) = 0

Multiply through:

- n_x^2 v2 / (n_z -1) ) + v2 (-n_z -1) = 0

Factor out v2:

v2 [ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Since we're looking for non-trivial solutions (v2 ≠0), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

- n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Expanding the second term:

(-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) ) → -n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 → -n_z^2 +1.

So the equation becomes:

- n_x^2 + (-n_z^2 +1 ) = 0 → (-n_x^2 -n_z^2 +1 ) =0.

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, this becomes (-1 +1) =0 → 0=0, which holds true. So the equations are dependent, and thus, any solution of equation (1) will satisfy equation (2).

So from equation (1):

v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Let me choose v2 = (n_z -1 ), assuming n_z ≠1. Then v1 = -n_x.

Wait, but then v1 = -n_x and v2 = (n_z -1 ). But perhaps a better approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter. Let me set v2 =1, and solve for v1.

So v2 =1 → from equation (1):

v1 (n_z -1) + n_x *1 =0 → v1 = -n_x / (n_z -1 )

But it's not always convenient, especially when n_z =1. Maybe it's better to find the eigenvector in terms of angles.

Wait, another approach: Since the operator is along a direction n in the x-z plane, the eigenvector can be written in terms of angles. Let me think about the spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates of S·n are spin-up and spin-down along n. The eigenvectors can be written using the angles θ and φ, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ=0 because n is in the x-z plane (so φ=0 or π, but let's take φ=0 for simplicity).

The general form of the spin-up state along direction (θ, φ=0) is:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |→⟩

Wait, no, more accurately, the eigenstate for spin-up along (θ, φ) is:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + sin(θ/2) |↓⟩

But since in our case, φ=0, so:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + sin(θ/2) |↓⟩

Wait, but another way to write this is in terms of the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, the eigenvector can be expressed as:

v = [ a, b ]

So for spin-up along n, the components would be a and b. Let me think. The eigenstate for spin-up along n has components a and b given by:

a = cos(θ/2)

b = sin(θ/2)

Wait, but that's only if φ=0. If φ is non-zero, then perhaps the second component has a phase factor. But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π, but let's take φ=0 for simplicity.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which would fit this, but let's see what the options are.

Wait, the options are presented as possible eigenvectors. Let's see the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but let me think. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the spin-up state would have components depending on θ, which is the angle from the z-axis. So perhaps the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would correspond to option C. But wait, option C's second term is sin(theta/2), which is correct. But looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvector explicitly. Let's proceed.

We have the eigenvector equation: (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z) |v> = |v>.

The matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Which I can write as:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We can find the eigenvectors by solving (A - I)|v> = 0.

So A - I is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

The equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 → equation (1)

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0 → equation (2)

Let me take v1 as a variable and express v2 in terms of v1.

From equation (1): v2 = [ (1 - n_z) v1 ] / n_x

Wait, but n_x can't be zero because then n would be along the z-axis. If n_x=0, then n is along z, and the eigenvector would be (1,0) or (0,1). But since n is arbitrary in x-z, let's proceed assuming n_x ≠0.

Substituting v2 into equation (2):

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z) v1 / n_x ] = 0

Factor v1:

v1 [ n_x + ( (-n_z -1) (1 - n_z) ) / n_x ] =0

So:

n_x + [ (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ) ] / n_x =0

Multiply both sides by n_x:

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) =0

Expand the second term:

(-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z )

= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 +n_z

Simplify:

(-n_z + n_z) cancels, so we have n_z^2 -1.

So:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1 ) =0 → but since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1,

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) = n_x^2 + (1 -n_x^2 -1) ) = n_x^2 + (-n_x^2 ) =0 → 0=0.

So the equation holds, which means we have a one-parameter family of solutions. So we can choose v1 as a parameter, say v1 =1, then find v2.

Wait, but if I set v1=1, then from equation (1): (n_z -1)*1 + n_x v2 =0 → v2 = (1 - n_z)/n_x.

So the eigenvector is (1, (1-n_z)/n_x ). But since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, we can choose any non-zero multiple.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize in terms of the angle theta.

Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, let's let theta be the angle from the z-axis. So:

n_z = cos(theta)
n_x = sin(theta)

Because in spherical coordinates, for a point in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0, so the direction vector is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So substituting n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta).

Then the matrix A is [[cos(theta), sin(theta)],
                        [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ]

The eigenvector equation is (A - I)|v> =0.

So (cos(theta)-1) v1 + sin(theta) v2 =0 → equation (1)

sin(theta) v1 + (-cos(theta)-1) v2 =0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1):

v1 = [ sin(theta) v2 ] / (1 - cos(theta) )

Let me write this as v1 = [ sin(theta) / (1-cos(theta)) ] v2.

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 ), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ).

So the ratio becomes [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] ) = cot(theta/2 )

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me choose v2 = sin(theta/2 ), then v1 = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, that's option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )).

But wait, are there any phase factors? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are defined up to a phase, but the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). That seems correct.

Alternatively, let me think about another approach. The operator P is along n, so the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states. The spin-up state along n in the x-z plane would have components based on theta. So the state can be written as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

So this would correspond to option C.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. The problem states the operator is P, which is the same as the spin operator scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P·n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Which aligns with our earlier approach, so the eigenvector is correctly given by option C.

Alternatively, looking at the other options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ ). This seems to have units of ħ, but eigenvectors are dimensionless, so perhaps this is incorrect.

Option B
