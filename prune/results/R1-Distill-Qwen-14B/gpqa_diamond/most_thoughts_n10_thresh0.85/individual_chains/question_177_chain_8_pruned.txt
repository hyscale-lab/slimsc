Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Oh, but wait, the question says the luminosities are compared using black body radiation, so I think I need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here.

Wait, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared multiplied by its temperature to the fourth power. So the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, that should apply here.

But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is same, then T is same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait, if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, that would imply that T1 = T2. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if the λmax is same, their temperatures are the same. But wait, isn't that a bit
