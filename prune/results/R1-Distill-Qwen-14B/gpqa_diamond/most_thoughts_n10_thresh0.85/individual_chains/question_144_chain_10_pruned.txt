Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their mean path length depends on how long they live before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther they can travel before decaying. But particles moving at high speeds will also have a larger mean path. So I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime multiplied by its velocity and the speed of light, maybe?

But wait, how does the lifetime relate to the width Γ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime) is given by τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the width in the energy spectrum, and the lifetime is the inverse of the uncertainty in energy.

So the formula I'm thinking of is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should check the units here. ħ is in units of GeV·s, since Planck's constant h is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, and ħ is h/(2π), but the exact value is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ would be in seconds.

So first, I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Then τ = ħ / Γ. Let me calculate that. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s. Let's compute 6.582 /0.32. 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is a bit more than 20.5. So like 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, wait, I've got τ in seconds, right. Now, the
