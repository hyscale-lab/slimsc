Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is such that when the star rotates, it causes brightness variations, mimicking what might look like an exoplanet transiting. The question is asking: if instead, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star?

Hmm. So I think the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the transit depth) caused by a planet and compare it to the brightness variation caused by the spots. The problem states that if the star wasn't spotted, the same amplitude would require a planet of a certain radius. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth is the same as the variation from the spots.

Wait, but wait, the star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit more complicated. Because when the spots are on the visible side (and then rotate away), the star's overall brightness changes. But how much would that change be?

Let me think. First, the star's brightness without any spots is given by its total luminosity. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So the total brightness change would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature.

The star's radius is Rstar, same as the Sun. The filling factor f is 20%, so f = 0.2. Each spot has a temperature T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. So each spot is cooler.

The star's total luminosity without spots (L0) is 4πRstar² * sigma * Teff^4. The spots' luminosity is f * 4πRstar² * sigma * T_spot^4. But wait, when the spots rotate into view, the star's total luminosity decreases because a part of its surface (the spots) is cooler. So the observed luminosity when the spots are visible would be L = L0 - (f * L_spot), where L_spot is the luminosity per unit area of the spots.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. The fractional change ΔL/L0 would be (ΔL) / L0. The spots contribute less light, so ΔL is negative.

Let me calculate the contribution of the spots. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, but wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the total area of spots on the entire star is 0.2 * (2πR^2) because the hemisphere is 2πR². Wait, no, wait. The star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². If one hemisphere has 20% coverage, then the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) )= 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface. Wait, no; wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2. But the filling factor is the fraction of the observed hemisphere that is covered by spots. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute 20% of that hemisphere's area. So each hemisphere has an area of 2πR², and the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². But the entire star's surface is 4π R², so the fraction of the entire star covered by spots is (0.4π R²)/(4π R²) )= 0.1, or 10%. So the total area of spots is 0.1 * 4π R²? No, wait, that's not correct. The spotty hemisphere is the one we see, but when the star rotates, the spots that were on the other side come into view. Wait, no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So maybe when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the star is being observed, and the spots on one hemisphere cause the brightness to vary as the star rotates. So when the spotty side is facing us, the star is dimmer. When the other side (non-spotty) is facing, the star is brighter.

So the maximum brightness occurs when the spotty hemisphere is not visible (i.e., when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us). The minimum brightness is when the spotty hemisphere is facing. So the brightness variation would be the difference between these two scenarios.

So, let me model the star's brightness when the spotty side is visible (minimum brightness) and when it's not (maximum). But wait, no. Because even when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, it's not that the entire star is spotted, just a part of it. So the star's total brightness when the spots are visible is L = L_unspotted + L_spots.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total luminosity without any spots is L_total = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. The spots are cooler, so when spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star's brightness decreases. The amount of decrease depends on the area of the spots and their temperature.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the observed luminosity is L_obs = L_total * (1 - (f * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ))) ? Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4. The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4. The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is f = 0.2 (but wait, no: the filling factor is 0.2 for one hemisphere, which is 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) ) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1,
