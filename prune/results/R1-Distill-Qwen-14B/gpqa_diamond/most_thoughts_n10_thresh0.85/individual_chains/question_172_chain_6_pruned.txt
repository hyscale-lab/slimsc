Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of energy levels changes with temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think this is the value of ΔE. Oh wait, wait. Let me think. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. Specifically, n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but wait, is the question comparing the same level or different levels? Oh, the energy difference is the same for both stars, I think. Because the energy levels themselves are the same; the difference is just a fixed value between the two levels.

Let me rephrase. For star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2 in the same energy level. So, the ratio (n_1 / n_2) is 2. But wait, wait. No, wait. Because n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is given by that exponential.

Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. Hmm, maybe I need to model this. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of the upper level (U) to the lower level (L) as R = U/L.

So for star_1: R1 = U1/L1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited, meaning more in the upper level). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Oh, wait, 'specific energy level'—so perhaps each star's considered level has a different population. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the excited state is the same for both. So, the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But considering that each star's own ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should model it mathematically.

Let me define ΔE as the energy difference between two levels, E_upper and E_lower, so ΔE = E_upper - E_lower.

In LTE, the ratio of the populations in the upper and lower levels is given by:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

So for star_1, the ratio is R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And for star_2, the ratio is R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the excited atoms (probably
