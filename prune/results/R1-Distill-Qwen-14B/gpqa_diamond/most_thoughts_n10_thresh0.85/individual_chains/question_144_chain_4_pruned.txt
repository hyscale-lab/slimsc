Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, specifically bosons, composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They decay quickly. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas here.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate it and see which option matches.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor, multiplied by the velocity. But wait, let me think again. Decay length L is c times gamma times the proper lifetime tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but wait, E here is the total energy. Or is it based on the energy of the particle?

Wait, the particle's energy E is given, which is 8 GeV. Its mass is 1.2 GeV, so I can calculate gamma as E/(m c²). But wait, the units might complicate things. Let me think about units. But maybe I don't need to worry about units because I'm working with GeV and can use natural units where c=1?

Wait, no, because the final answer is in meters, so I can't ignore units entirely. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I think the first step is to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħc / tau, but wait, no, I think it's Γ multiplied by the lifetime equals ħ. Wait, no. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for the Breit-Wigner distribution, the lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ. Or wait, the natural line width is Γ, and the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ/(Γ). But I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the decay width Γ by tau = ħ / Γ. Because the decay width is the energy width corresponding to the uncertainty in the particle's lifetime. So yes, tau = ħ / Γ.

But I need to be careful about units. Because ħ is in J·s, but the width Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert units properly.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) of the meson using its energy E.
3. Calculate the velocity beta (v/c) based on gamma and the rest mass energy.
4. The mean decay distance is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, yes. Because the mean lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime
