Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. 

So let's compute the sum. ΔE1 is 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV. Adding them together: 6.56e-7 + 0.656e-7 = approximately 7.216e-7 eV. 

Looking at the options, I need to find an energy difference larger than 7.2e-7 eV. Let me check the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001 e-6 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7. So no, can't resolve.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller, no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 7.2e-7. Yes, that's way bigger. So it could be resolved.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. Comparing to 7.2e-7, which is 7.2e-7 is 72e-8. So 1e-8 is less than 72e-8, so no good.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So we need ΔE > sum of uncertainties. So any ΔE larger than that would work. 

So the options are: 

C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So that's good.

Wait, but are the uncertainties additive? Or is the uncertainty in the energy difference just the maximum of the two? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, the energy difference's uncertainty would be the minimum of the two, perhaps? Or perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is dominated by the shorter lifetime? Let me think.

No, wait. Each state has its own energy uncertainty. The energy difference between the two states would have an uncertainty that's the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because when you measure the difference, the uncertainty adds in quadrature, but perhaps in the worst case, it adds linearly. Or maybe the maximum of the two. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, but when you take the difference, perhaps the dominant uncertainty is the larger one.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the difference ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty would be sqrt( (ΔE2)^2 + (ΔE1)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. But that's the formula for combining uncertainties when adding. So for subtraction, same as addition.

But in our case, what's the correct way to get the uncertainty in the energy difference?

Wait, let me think. Suppose E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2. The energy difference ΔE has uncertainty sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), because each energy has its own uncertainty, and when you subtract, the uncertainties add in quadrature.

So let me recalculate the uncertainty in the energy difference:

ΔE_diff ≈ sqrt( (6.56e-7)^2 + (6.56e-8)^2 ) eV.

Calculating that:

(6.56e-7)^2 = approx 4.3e-13.

(6.56e-8)^2 = approx 4.3e-15.

Adding them: 4.3e-13 + 4.3e-15 ≈ 4.3043e-13.

Square root of that is sqrt(4.3043e-13) ≈ 6.56e-6.5 eV? Wait, no, sqrt(4.3e-13) is about 6.56e-6.5? Wait, 4.3e-13 is (6.56e-7)^2. Oh wait, that's the same as (6.56e-7)^2. So the square root would be 6.56e-7 eV, which is the same as ΔE1, since ΔE2 is smaller. So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be approximately 6.56e-7 eV.

Wait, that's interesting. So the energy difference's uncertainty is about 6.56e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that for us to resolve them.

So the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV: 0.001e-6 → 0.001 n eV. Way smaller than 6.5e-7 eV (which is 0.656e-6 eV). So no.

B) 1e-11 eV: Even smaller, so no.

C) 1e-4 eV: 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. Which is much larger than 6.5e-7 eV. So yes, it could be resolved.

D) 1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is less than 6.56e-7. So no.

So option C is the correct answer.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E_1 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(6.56 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.56 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
(6.56 \times 10^{-7})^2 = 4.30 \times 10^{-13}, \quad (6.56 \times 10^{-8})^2 = 4.30 \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{4.30 \times 10^{-13} + 4.30 \times 10^{-15}} \approx \sqrt{4.30 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be greater than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
