Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think. A rhombohedral crystal is one where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, sometimes called a trigonal crystal system too. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance probably refers to the lattice parameter, which is 'a' in this case. And all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. That's calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos beta) + 2(hl cos gamma) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, no, I might be mixing something up. Oh wait, no, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the Miller indices hkl.

Wait, the formula I remember is d = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + other terms) ^ something. No, wait, I think the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) ). But since in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α=β=γ=30 degrees. So cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) )

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, no, I think I got it wrong
