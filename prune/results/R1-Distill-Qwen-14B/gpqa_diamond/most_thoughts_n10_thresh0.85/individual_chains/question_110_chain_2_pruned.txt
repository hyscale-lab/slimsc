Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some key points about the two spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars have to be bright enough for both instruments.

Wait, no. Actually, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag are observed. So, wait, higher magnitude means fainter, right? Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Like, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16 and <=17? Wait, no. Because if a star is at V=16.5, HIRES can't detect it, because it's brighter than 16? Or wait, the statement says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So for ESPRESSO, V < 17. Because higher magnitude is fainter. So stars with V=17 or fainter are not observable. But wait, the question says "brighter than 17 can be observed", so V <17. So for a star to be observed by ESPRESSO, its apparent magnitude must be less than (brighter than) 17.

Similarly, for HIRES, "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed". So apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. So the star must have V <16 to be seen by HIRES. Because both spectrographs can observe it, the star's V must be less than the lower limit of the two. So the stricter condition is V <16.

Wait, no. Because if a star's V is, say, 16.5, then ESPRESSO would see it because 16.5 <17. But HIRES requires V <16, so 16.5 is too
