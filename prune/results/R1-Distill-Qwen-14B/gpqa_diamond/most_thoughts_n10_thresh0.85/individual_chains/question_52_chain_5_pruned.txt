Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Astronomers are looking at a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So, first, I think about what affects the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. Because in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of different energy levels is determined by the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Where:
- n_i is the number of atoms in level i
- g_i is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of level i
- E_i is the energy of level i
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

So the ratio of levels 1 and 2 (let's say level 1 is the lower energy level since the ratio decreases when spots are present) would be (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. 

But wait, does the presence of spots affect the local temperature where the Ti atoms are? Or is the overall Teff lower because some parts are cooler? Hmm. The question states that the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower, which affects the ionization and excitation states of atoms.

But wait, in the case of starspots, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall observed effective temperature is lower. But the photosphere without spots is at 6000 K, and when spots are present, the average is 5500 K. 

But wait, the question is about the stellar photosphere. So in the photosphere when spots are present, does each region (spot and non-spot) have the same temperature? Or is the entire photosphere on average at 5500 K? Hmm, I think the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. So the temperature considered is the average, but perhaps we need to model the contributions from both the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So perhaps the unspotted regions are at the original 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot. Then the overall Teff is a weighted average of those two.

Wait, but the problem states that the effective temperature of the whole photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So maybe the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature. So the effective temperature is a sum of the fluxes from both regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire photosphere (including spots) is at 5500 K. But that might not make sense, because the spots themselves are cooler, so the average would be lower than 6000 K. So when 40% is spotted, the average Teff is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the entire star's photosphere is now at 5500 K on average. Alternatively, perhaps each part of the photosphere is either at 6000 K or cooler, but the average is 5500 K.

But regardless, the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So if the temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present, how does this affect the ratio n1/n2.

Wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotless (Teff=6000 K), the ratio is higher than when it's spotted (Teff=
