Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options A to D. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, so I'm trying to remember the reactions involving ketones and nitriles. Let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh right, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like from NaCN), it's a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN. But wait, wouldn't that give a ketone nitrile? Or is there more to it?

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would replace the O with CN, giving (CH3)2CNC. Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures to see.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure would be CH2(C(COOH)(CN)CH3) or wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN? Let me think. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure should be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile has four carbons, right? So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Or maybe CH3CH2CH2CN? Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused
