Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because the rules change. Relativity, right? Einstein's theory. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed, and for the energy, I'll probably have to use the total relativistic energy formula.

The question says astronaut 1 has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, we're to find the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame, and the total energy.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, wait. The problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." Oh, so for the relative speed, I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. But wait, the options are giving a single relative speed, so I wonder which way it's being measured. Oh, perhaps it's the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame, or vice versa. But since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference adjusted for relativity.

And for the total energy, perhaps I need to calculate the sum of their energies in the same frame. Wait, but energy is frame-dependent. Oh, maybe the question is considering the rest frame where the total momentum is zero, but that's the center of momentum frame. Or maybe it's the sum of their energies as seen from the lab frame? Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear, but I think perhaps the question is treating each astronaut's energy in their own rest frame and then adding them. Or maybe the total energy is the sum of the energies in the lab frame where they are moving.

Wait, the problem says "the system." So perhaps the system's total energy would be the sum of their energies in the same frame. But what frame? If we're considering the rest frame of the combined system, that's the center of momentum frame. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each astronaut's rest frame energy. But I'm a bit confused.

Let me take it step by step.

First, the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed u' (of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame) can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the speed of the object in the original frame (here, astronaut 2's speed as seen from the lab), and v is the speed of the original frame (here, astronaut 1's speed as seen from the lab). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Sorry, I might be getting this confused.

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at v = 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut 2 is moving at u = 0.5c in the lab frame. So, what is the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame? So, the lab frame is S, astronaut 1 is moving at v = 0.6c, so the astronaut 1's rest frame is S'. We want to find the speed of astronaut 2 in S', which is u'.

The formula for velocity transformation is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So substituting u = 0.5c and v = 0.6c:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/(c²)) 

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6 c²) / c² → 1 - (0.3) = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "relative speed" which is a scalar. So the answer's relative speed is 0.14c.

Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a good start.

Now for the total energy. Let's see.

Total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. But wait, which frame are we considering? Because in different frames, the energies change.

If the question is asking for the total energy in the lab frame, then each astronaut's energy would be calculated in the lab frame and summed. Alternatively, if it's the center of momentum frame, then perhaps we calculate the energies there, but that's more complicated.

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Well, system energy is frame-dependent, but in the rest frame of the combined system, the total energy would be the sum of rest masses plus the kinetic energy in that frame. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the energies in the lab frame.

But looking at the options: option B says E=4.96 mc^2, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, D says E=5 mc^2.

Wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So the rest energies are 2mc^2 and 3mc^2. So sum of rest energies is 5mc^2. But in the lab frame, each astronaut has kinetic energy as well.

Wait, so astronaut 1's energy in lab frame is gamma * m_rest * c². Similarly for astronaut 2.

So, for astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mass of astronaut 1 is 2m. So m_rest is 2m. So E1 = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2's v is 0.5c. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Then total energy in lab frame is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering the rest energy of the combined system, which would be the sum of rest masses, 2m +3m=5m, so 5mc². But that's only the rest energy. But then the system's energy would be higher because they're moving, but wait, in the center of momentum frame the total energy is the sum of their energies as seen from that frame. Hmm, but that would require more calculations.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the total energy is simply E1 + E2 = 5.96 mc². So that would correspond to option C, which has v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

So that would be the correct choice. Let me confirm.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed, which we found to be 0.14c, and the total energy is the sum of their energies in the lab frame, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of astronaut 1 in the lab frame),
- \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of astronaut 2 in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts in the lab frame. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut 1:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \),
- Speed \( v_1 = 0.6c \),
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \),
- Energy \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \).

#### For astronaut 2:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \),
- Speed \( v_2 = 0.5c \),
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \),
- Energy \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \).

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
