Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. But I'm not sure, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the nucleus is X, which is Li (lithium) with 3 neutrons. So the atomic number Z is 3 (since Li has 3 protons). The mass number A would be Z plus the number of neutrons, so 3 +3=6. So X is lithium-6. Okay, so the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

The problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, so we're dealing with relativistic mechanics here. I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c.

Let me compute gamma:

v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (because 0.28 squared is 0.0784)
So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma * m * c². But I need the mass of the nucleus X. X is Li-6. So I need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus in kilograms to calculate E, or perhaps there's a way to express it in terms of the atomic mass unit (u) and then convert to GeV.

Wait, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the atomic mass. The mass of one atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg, but more importantly, 1 u of mass is equivalent to about 931.5 MeV/c². Oh, right, because E=mc², so 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So the mass of Li-6 is what? Let's think. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately... I think it's about 6.017 u. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The exact mass is important for the calculation, but I might need to look it up. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass can be approximated, or maybe it's given in the question. Wait, the problem doesn't provide the exact mass, so perhaps I'm supposed to take a value from a standard table.

I think the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.01753 u. So I'll take m = 6.01753 u.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the binding energy, but that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the molar mass in u for the nucleus is the right approach. So, for Li-6, the molar mass is approximately 6.017 u.

So m = 6.017 u.

But wait, another thought: in particle physics, the mass is often given in GeV/c². So perhaps I can convert the mass from u to GeV/c² by multiplying by 931.5 MeV/u, which is 0.9315 GeV. So 6.017 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ? Let's compute that.

6.017 * 0.9315 ≈ 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, and 0.017 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.0158. So total is approximately 5.6048 GeV/c².

Wait, let me do the exact multiplication:

6.017 * 0.9315 = ?

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589
0.017 * 0.9315 = 0.0158355
Adding them gives 5.589 + 0.0158355 = 5.6048355 GeV/c².

So m c² is approximately 5.6048 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m c². So gamma is about 3.5714, so E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6048 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 *5.6048.

Hmm, 3 *5.6048 is 16.8144, and 0.5714 *5.6048.

0.5 *5.6048 = 2.8024, 0.0714 *5.6048 ≈ 0.4016. So 2.8024 + 0.4016 ≈ 3.204. So total E ≈ 16.8144 +3.204 = 20.0184 GeV.

Wait, that's 20.0184 GeV. Let me check more accurately.

Wait, 3.5714 * 5.6048.

Let me compute using exact multiplication:

Let me calculate 3.5714 *5.6048:

First, 3 *5.6048 = 16.8144
0.5 *5.6048 = 2.8024
0.07 *5.6048 = 0.392336
0.0014 *5.6048 = 0.00784672
Adding all together: 16.8144 +2.8024 = 19.6168; 19.6168 +0.392336=20.0091; 20.0091 +0.00784672≈20.0169 GeV.

Wait, but I'm using 3.5714 as gamma, which is approximately 25/7. Let me do it more accurately.

Gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28. 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.6048355 GeV.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 25/7 *5.6048355.

25 *5.6048355 = 140.1208875. Then divide by 7: 140.1208875 /7 ≈20.01727 GeV.

So approximately 20.017 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C
