Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question gives the brightness limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 mag. Wait, no. Wait, I think I got that reversed. Oh no, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So the brighter a star, the lower its magnitude. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that's m < 17. Because 17 is a higher number, so it's dimmer. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 mag (but not fainter than that). HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 mag, so m < 16. So what's the key point here? Well, each spectrograph can detect stars down to certain apparent magnitudes. So a star that's brighter than 17 can be detected by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 by HIRES. So which stars are bright enough (apparent magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO, less than 16 for HIRES) to be detected by both?

Wait, the question is asking
