Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopy data provided. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the IR data. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So this compound probably has an alcohol group (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, maybe around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the question says "very broad" which might suggest it's a hydroxyl group, like in an alcohol or maybe another functional group.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, but perhaps a conjugated one, like maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone? Or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution, like conjugation. Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but that's not one of the options here. Since the options don't include nitrogen, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and 1650 is an aromatic C=O? Or maybe an alkene's C=C. Wait, no, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are H's attached to a double bond. So maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch? But wait, I'm a bit confused. Typically, C=C stretches are around 1600-1680. So maybe both 1700 and 1650 are carbonyl groups. But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl, the other is an aromatic ring or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be an ester (which is usually around 1740-1720), but maybe a conjugated ester could be a bit lower. Alternatively, a ketone is around 1700-1720. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. That makes sense because the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated system with a carbonyl group next to a double bond.

Moving on to the NMR. There are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. The presence suggests maybe an alkene group in the structure.

Now the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43, not 45), or maybe something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment C3H7O or something. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 3*6 +16 = 24 +18 +16= wait, no, (CH3)2O is (2*15) +16? Let me calculate: 12*2 (2 carbons) + 6 (for the 6 H's in two CH3 groups) +16 (O) = 24 +6 +16=46? Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's C3H9O+? Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular ion of something like (CH2)2CO or another group. Alternatively, it might be a cleavage product. Another thought: in Mass Spec, common fragments like the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is m/z 91, so that's not it. Maybe the m/z 45 is a small fragment, like a methyl group attached to an oxygen or something.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible molecular formulas given. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Let me list their degrees of unsaturation to see:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N.

For C6H12O:
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one ring or double bond.

C6H10O:
DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. Two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C6H10O2:
DoU = (14 -10 -2*2)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Wait, wait: formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, DoU is (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Because O doesn't affect DoU. So same as C6H10O.

Wait, another approach: for each molecule,

C6H12O: 6*2 +2 =14. 14-12 =2. 2/2=1 DoU.

C6H10O: 14-10=4 → 2 DoU.

C6H10O2: 14-10=4 → 2 DoU.

C6H12O2: 14-12=2 → 1 DoU.

So the options have varying DoU.

Looking back at the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, which implies at least one DoU (a double bond). So the compound must have at least one DoU.

Looking at the IR, the peaks at 1700 and 1650—earlier thought was maybe two carbonyl groups. If so, each carbonyl is a DoU. So that's two DoU. But the options C6H10O and C6H10O2 have two DoU, while others have one.

But wait, the FTIR peaks: 1700 is probably a carbonyl (like ketone, ester, aldehyde, etc.), and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond (C=C) or an aromatic ring. Alternatively, the 1650 might be an amide or another group, but as the options don't include N, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought—what if the 1650 is a C-O stretch? No, that's usually around 1250-1050. So that's unlikely. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, meaning that the carbonyl is next to a double bond, which would contribute to the DoU
