Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the spectroscopy data provided. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the problem says that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually suggest O-H stretching. So, that makes me think the compound has either an alcohol (-OH) group or maybe a carboxylic acid (-COOH), because those have broad O-H stretches. Wait, but carboxylic acids also have a carbonyl group which might show up elsewhere. Let me hold that thought.

Then, the FTIR has two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is where carbonyl groups (C=O) typically absorb. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl, which might suggest something else. Wait, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or maybe an amide? Hmm, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide. Another possibility is that the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is from conjugated carbonyl groups, like in an ester or a ketone. Wait, but esters have two carbonyl groups? No, esters have a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which can have lower wavenumbers. Or maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated ketone or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has an alkene group. So, something like CH₂=CH- or maybe part of a ring or another structure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45, but more likely, it's a CO group plus something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule. Let me think: the molecular ion or a fragment breaking off. For example, if the molecule has a carbonyl group, say, maybe an ester, the loss of an ester group could leave a fragment. Wait, but 45 is the exact mass of, say, (CH3)2CHO or something else? Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Wait, maybe it's the loss of a methyl ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Hmm, not entirely sure yet.

Now, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let's write their molecular formulas:

- Option A: C6H12O2
- Option B: C6H10O
- Option C: C6H10O2
- Option D: C6H12O

I need to figure out which one fits all the data.

Let me start with the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H, which would mean either an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if it were a carboxylic acid, I'd expect a peak around 2500-3300 (which I think is covered by the broad 3000), and also a strong peak for the carbonyl around 1700. But the 1700 and 1650 are both there. Wait, maybe it's an ester or a ketone, but then why the O-H? Alternatively, perhaps a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another thought: if the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl group, that would fit with either a carboxylic acid (which has both, but the O-H is very broad and the carbonyl is around 1700). Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol? But the IR would have the carbonyl and a broad O-H. Alternatively, maybe an ester and an alcohol? Or perhaps an ester group where the carbonyl is at 1700 and maybe another group, like a conjugated double bond leading to the 1650.

Wait, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond. Let's think about possible structures.

If the molecule is an ester, it would have a carbonyl group. But the FTIR has two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. Hmm, perhaps an ester and another carbonyl group? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, which could lower the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl (like ester or ketone), and the 1650 is from an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the options are all six carbons. Let's think about possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. For C6H12O2: the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for an ester is CnH2nO2. For n=3, it's C3H6O2. Wait, but here it's C6H12O2, which is like 2 ester groups? No, that's unlikely. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester (lactone) or something else. Alternatively, maybe a di-ester, but that would require more oxygen. Hmm, maybe a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 6 carbons, 10 H. For each molecule, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees: maybe one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So maybe a ring and a double bond, or a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree: either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR says vinyl Hs, so perhaps a double bond.

Now, let's revisit the IR. The broad peak at 3000 might suggest an -OH group. So we can eliminate any structure without an -OH. Looking at the options, only options A and C have two oxygens, which might suggest the presence of more oxygen-containing groups. But wait, option B and D have one oxygen. So if the FTIR indicates an -OH, then options B and D, which have only one oxygen, might not fit if the structure requires two oxygen-containing groups. Alternatively, if the compound is a diol, but that would require two -OH groups, but the IR would show a broad peak, but maybe two oxygens in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't a diol but another structure with an -OH.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak, which is more indicative of an -OH group, perhaps in an alcohol. So if the compound has an -OH group, then the formula must have at least one oxygen. But if the IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, that would require another oxygen, making the formula have two oxygens. So perhaps the formula is either A or C. Because options B and D have only one oxygen, but the IR suggests both O-H and C=O, which would require two oxygens. So that would point to options A or C.

So that reduces the options to A and C: C6H12O2 (A) and C6H10O2 (C).

Now, looking at the NMR data: peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So the structure must have a double bond. So both A and C have enough carbons for a double bond.

The MS shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about common fragments. 45 can be a (CH3)2CHO- group? Or maybe a CH2CH2O group. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (which is 58? Wait, wait, (CH3)2CHO is (46 for (CH3)2CH-OH? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me calculate: 45 is the mass. So 45 is 45 g/mol. What is the formula for 45? Let's think: 45 = 12a + 1b +16c. Let me find combinations. 12*3=36, 1*3=3, 16*0=0 → total 39. No. 12*2=24, 1*9=9 → 33. Doesn't reach 45. 12*1=12, 1*3=3, 16*(2)=32 → 12+3+32=47. Close. Alternatively, 12*3 +1*3 +16*0=39. Hmm. Or maybe 12*2 +1*1 +16*1=24+1+16=41. No. Wait, maybe 12*1 +1*9 +16*1=12+9+16=37. Not 45. Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)CO, which is 59? No. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to oxygen. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2O, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps it's the loss of a fragment that's 45. Like, the molecular ion breaks into two parts, one being 45.

Wait, let's think about the options. Let's take option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be at 116. If a fragment is at 45, then 116-45=71. That doesn't seem to ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So a fragment at 45 implies the other part is 114-45=69. Not sure.

Wait, another approach. The fragment m/z=45 is probably a common group. Let me think about possible groups with a mass of 45. For example, CH3COO- would have a mass of 60 (12*2 +1*4 +16*2=24+4+32=60). Not 45. Alternatively, maybe CH2CH2O is 45? Let's calculate: (CH2CH2O) is CH2CH2O. Wait, that's C2H4O. Molecular weight is (2*12)+(4*1)+(16)=24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Maybe CH2CH2OH (45 would be 45: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16 → total 45. So CH2CH2OH would be 45. That's a hydroxymethyl group. Or maybe another structure.

Wait, another possibility: 45 could be a ketene ion, like O=C=CH2, which would have a mass of 45. Because O is 16, C is 12, so 16 + 2*12 + 2*1 = 16+24+2=42. Hmm, no. Wait, O=C=CH2 has formula C2H2O. So 2*12 +2*1 +16 = 24+2+16=42. So that's not 45.

Hmm, maybe it's the loss of a fragment. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, the ester could cleave, releasing an alcohol. For instance, if the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not right. Alternatively, the ester could hydrolyze in the MS, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a ketone. For example, a fragment with a carbonyl group. For example, (CH3)2CO would be 58 (since (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58). No, that's higher than 45. Another possibility is an acyloxy group. Wait, maybe the molecule is an ester, and the ester group breaks off.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures for each.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could include an ester with a cyclohexane ring, or an ester with an alkene.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a benzene ring (but that would require more carbons). Alternatively, an ester with a cyclopentane and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a substituted ester, like methyl vinyl something. Let me think about the NMR: vinyl hydrogens indicate a double bond, so perhaps the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group.

So for example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. That has a double bond (vinyl Hs), an ester group (so two oxygen atoms), and an O-H? Wait, no, methyl acrylate is an ester, so it doesn't have an O-H. So that's a problem. Because the FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, so the compound must have an -OH group.

Wait, maybe it's a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has both a carbonyl and an ester group. But then, would that have an O-H?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures that fit the IR, NMR, and MS data.

So, considering the IR data: O-H, C=O, and another peak at 1650 which could be an alkene or conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Mass spec shows a fragment at 45.

Let me think about possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: Maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a gamma or delta lactone. Alternatively, a di-substituted ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent. For example, cyclohexene with an ester group attached, like O-CO-OCH3 or something.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula.

Another approach: Degrees of unsaturation.

For option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one degree: either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present. So that would account for the one degree. So the structure would have a double bond and one ring? Or a double bond and another group.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak that suggests an O-H, so it's an alcohol, which would have one degree (the O-H is not a degree of unsaturation; that's a single bond). So with option A's formula, which has one degree, that would mean either a double bond or a ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present. So for option A, with one degree, that would require a double bond and that's it. So perhaps a cyclopropane ring and a double bond? That's unlikely for a six-carbon compound.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring and a double bond. But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for option A is only 1, so that would mean either a ring or a double bond, not both. So if the compound has a double bond (as in the NMR), then the other degree must come from somewhere else. Wait, no, the degrees of unsaturation calculation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for option A, the calculation comes to 1. So the molecule has one degree, which is either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR indicates a double bond, so that uses up the single degree. Therefore, the structure must have a double bond but no rings. Or a ring but no double bond, which can't be because the NMR shows vinyl Hs.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present. So if option C has two degrees, one is the double bond, the other could be a ring. So the structure might be a cyclic compound with a double bond, like a cyclohexene ring, and another functional group.

Alternatively, maybe a diene and a ring? Not sure.

But wait, let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Let me think about the mass spec fragment. 45 is a key mass. Let's think about possible functional groups that could lose a fragment of 45.

In an ester, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. If the molecule is an ester and an alcohol, perhaps the ester group could split off. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a hydroxyl group, maybe during fragmentation, the ester group breaks away as an acylium ion or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2. Let's compute their molecular weights.

Option A: 6*12=72 + 12*1=12 + 2*16=32 → 72+12+32=116.

Option C: 6*12=72 +10*1=10 +2*16=32 → 72+10+32=114.

So, the molecular ion would be at m/z 116 (A) or 114 (C).

If a fragment is at 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into 45 and another part. For option A (116), 116-45=71. What's a fragment of 71? Maybe a cyclopentyl group (C5H9+ would be 71?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 71 is the molecular weight of CH2=CHCOOH (acrylic acid?), which is 72, no. Hmm.

Wait, the fragment could be from the ester group. For example, if the molecule is an ester, the ester group (O-CO-O-R) could break away. The ester group itself would be R-O-CO-O-R', but in the case of R = methyl, the fragment would be 99 (for O-CO-OCH3 is 15 + 43 = 58? No, wait. Let me think. Methyl ester group is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, the molecular weight of O-CO-OCH3 is 16 (O) + 44 (COO-) + 15 (CH3) → 16+44+15=75. No, that's not matching 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss of a methylene group (CH2) which is 14. Then, 116-14=102. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for ketones. But I don't know if that applies here.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the mass of a methyl group with an oxygen. Wait, methyl is 15, but 45 is three times that. 3*(CH3) would be 3*15=45. Oh! So maybe the fragment is (CH3)3O+? That would be 15*3 +16= 45 +16=61? No, that's not right. Alternatively, (CH3)3O+ is 61. Hmm, no. Maybe (CH2CH2O+) which is 44? No.

Wait, maybe it's a trimethylene oxide ion, which is O(C2H4)3? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion. The ketene ion is O=C=CH2, which has a mass of 44 (12+16 + 12 + 2*1 = 12+16=28; 12+2=14; 28+14=42? Wait, no: O is 16, each C is 12, each H is 1. So O=C=CH2: 16 + 12 + 12 + 2*1 = 16+24+2=42. So the mass is 42, not 45.

Hmm, perhaps it's the loss of a fragment. For instance, if the molecular ion is 114 (option C), the loss of 69 would leave 45. Not sure what 69 is. Alternatively, if it's 116 (option A), the loss of 71 leaves 45. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which likely implies an alkene. So the structure has a double bond.

The IR shows a broad O-H, so an alcohol group.

The IR also shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

So the compound could be an ester with an alcohol group and a double bond.

Wait, but how does that fit the molecular formula?

Let me think of a possible structure. For example, a compound with an ester group (O-CO-O-), an alcohol group (-OH), and a double bond.

But the molecular formula would have to accommodate that.

Option A is C6H12O2. Let's see: the ester group (O-CO-O-) has three oxygens, but the formula only has two, so that's not possible. So maybe it's not an ester.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. So, a ketone (C=O) and an -OH group.

So the formula would have two O's. For example, something like cyclohexanol with a ketone group.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has the formula C6H10O. But that's option B, which has only one O. So that wouldn't fit the IR data, which suggests two O-containing groups (the O-H and the C=O).

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol with a carbonyl. But that complicates things.

Another thought: the FTIR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700. The 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester).

So the structure might be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an -OH group.

Wait, but then the formula would need two oxygen atoms. So let's think of such a structure.

For example, something like CH₂=CHCO-O-R, where R is an alcohol group. Wait, but that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an -OH group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-diketone, but that's two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something similar, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: considering the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: 1 degree. So either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows a double bond, so that would mean that the structure has a double bond and no ring. So, for option A, the structure would have a double bond and that's it.

But then, if there's a carbonyl group (C=O), that would require another degree of unsaturation, which isn't possible because option A has only one. So that can't be. Because the carbonyl is another double bond. So that's a problem.

Wait, that would mean that option A can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl group because that would require two degrees of unsaturation, but option A only has one. So that would rule out option A.

So that leaves option C as the only possible option. Because option C has two degrees, which can accommodate a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me double-check. For option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So it can have two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings.

The NMR shows a double bond (so one degree), and the IR shows a carbonyl (another degree). So that fits.

So the structure has both a double bond and a carbonyl group, which would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, but the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond, making the carbonyl peak lower than 1700. So an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl would have the carbonyl at around 1700 and the conjugated double bond at 1650.

So the compound likely has an ester group (from the carbonyl at 1700) and a conjugated double bond (from the 1650 and the vinyl Hs in NMR). Plus, the O-H from the broad peak.

Wait, but the ester group would require two oxygen atoms. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, the mass spec. The fragment at 45. If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an -OH group, perhaps the ester group (O-CO-O-) would break off. Let's think: if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R is something with an -OH group.

Wait, maybe something like methyl acrylate with an -OH substituent. Let's think of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an allyl alcohol ester. For example, an ester where the ester group is attached to an allyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure, but the mass spec has a peak at 45. Let me think, for option C, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114.

If the fragment is 45, then the rest is 114-45=69. What's a possible fragment of 69?

69 could be the molecular weight of cyclopropane (but that's 42), or perhaps a propyl group attached to something. Alternatively, 69 is the molecular weight of a benzene ring with some substituents, but that's 78 for C6H6.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen. For example, a propyl ester group. Let me think: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 would have a molecular weight of (16 + 44 + 71) → 16+44=60, 71 is the propyl ester. Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Alternatively, the fragment could be an ethyl group with an oxygen. CH2CH2O would be 44. Close to 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is an acylium ion. For example, if the molecule loses a CH2CH2O group (44), the remaining would be 70, but that's not matching. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion (42), but that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be from the ester group. For example, the ester group (O-CO-O-) is 60. If it breaks off, the rest would be 114-60=54, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses a part of the structure, such as a CH2=CHCOO group. Let me calculate that. CH2=CHCOO is 72 (C3H4O2). 114-72=42. But the fragment is 45, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about which option fits all the data.

So, the most likely is option C: C6H10O2.

Because:

- FTIR: broad O-H (alcohol), carbonyl at 1700 (ester or ketone), and a conjugated double bond at 1650.

- 1H NMR: vinyl Hs, so double bond present.

- Degrees of unsaturation: 2, which account for the double bond and the carbonyl.

- The formula has two oxygen atoms, which matches the FTIR data.

As for the mass spec, I'm not 100% certain, but given the other data points, option C seems the best fit.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The following data was obtained:

1. **FTIR**: A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol). Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond.

2. **¹H NMR**: Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H₂C=CH-) indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at m/z = 45 was observed. This suggests the presence of a common fragment with a mass of 45, possibly related to the functional groups in the molecule.

### Analysis of the Options:
The molecular formulas provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each formula:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This could correspond to a double bond or a ring.
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This could correspond to two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, or a ring and a carbonyl group.
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This could correspond to a double bond and a carbonyl group, or a ring and a double bond.
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This could correspond to a double bond or a ring.

#### Key Observations:
1. The **FTIR data** indicates the presence of both an O-H group and a C=O group, which requires at least two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options **B** and **D**, as they only contain one oxygen atom.
2. The **¹H NMR data** shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. This requires at least one degree of unsaturation.
3. The **FTIR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which requires another degree of unsaturation.

#### Remaining Options:
After eliminating **B** and **D**, the remaining options are **A** and **C**. Both have two oxygen atoms and accommodate the double bond and carbonyl group.

- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This can only account for either a double bond or a ring, but not both. Since the NMR data confirms the presence of a double bond, this option is less likely.
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This can account for both a double bond and a carbonyl group, making it the most consistent with the data.

#### Mass Spectrometry:
The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is consistent with a common fragment, such as a methyl group or a related structure. While the exact identity of the fragment is unclear, the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option **C**) aligns better with the other spectroscopic data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data.
