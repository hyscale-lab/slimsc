Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different values in meters.

Wait, mesons are bosons, right? And they can decay into other particles. The mean decay distance would be how far the meson travels before it decays. I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the width. Oh, right! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to the width of its resonance.

So the formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact relationship is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ would be ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is the total decay width. Yeah, that's right.

But wait, the mean decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Because the particle is moving, so distance is velocity times time. So L = v * τ. Or L = v * (ħ / Γ).

But wait, how do I find the velocity of the meson? Since we have its energy and mass, I should be able to calculate its velocity using relativistic equations.

The meson's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than its rest mass, which means it's moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², maybe I can compute γ as E/(m c²) but in units where c=1, so E = γ m. So γ = E/m. Wait, but E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Once I have gamma, I can find the velocity. The velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Because gamma is γ = 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So rearranging, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Let me compute that. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667. Let's compute 1/γ²: 1/(6.6667)^2. 6.6667 squared is about 44.444, so 1/44.444 is approximately 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

So v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. Let me remember that c is about 3e8 m/s.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, wait. Units are important here. Because ħ has units of GeV·s if we're using natural units where c=1 and ħ is in those units.

Wait, I need to be careful with units. The decay width Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.
