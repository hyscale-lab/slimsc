Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they form sodium acetate and water. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution needs to be calculated first.

Molarity is moles per liter. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 0.040 L, the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Wait, the question is about 25% titration. I think that refers to when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, maybe it refers to when 25% of the initial volume of the acetic acid solution is titrated. Hmm, I think the first interpretation is correct, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted.

So let me clarify: The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would be when 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. Let me compute the moles first.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So at 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. 

Wait, but how much volume of NaOH does that correspond to? The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. But maybe I don't need that right now.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point volume. Hmm, no, I think it's the amount of acid neutralized. Let's proceed.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So, let's model the solution.

The initial concentrations after dilution: [CH3COOH] = 0.025 M, [CH3COO^-] = 0.

At 25% titration, 0.25 of the acetic acid is neutralized. So:

moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol.

moles of CH3COO^- formed = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is still 40 cm³, so the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.040 = 0.01875 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.040 = 0.00625 M.

Now, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.736 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733 or so, maybe 4.73).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.00625 / 0.01875). Let's compute that ratio.

0.00625 / 0.01875 = (6.25e-3) / (1.875e-2) = (6.25/187.5) * 100? Wait, 6.25 / 18.75 is 0.3333. Oh wait, 1.875e-2 is 0.01875, and 0.00625 is 6.25e-3. So 6.25e-3 / 1.875e-2 = 6.25 / 18.75 * (1e-3 / 1e-2) )= 0.3333 * (0.1) = 0.03333? Wait, no, wait, 6.25e-3 is 0.00625, 18.75e-3 is 0.01875. So 0.00625 / 0.01875 = 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But wait, perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recalculate: 0.00625 / 0.01875.

0.00625 is 62.5e-3, 0.01875 is 187.5e-3. 62.5 / 187.5 = 0.333... Yeah, that's correct. So log(1/3)= -0.4771. So 4.73 -0.4771 = 4.2529, so 4.25 is about right. So 4.25 would be the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of NaOH added at equivalence would be equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since the volume is 40 cm³, the concentration of acetate ions would be 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.025 M.

The hydrolysis reaction can be approximated by:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, so [OH^-] ≈ x.

So Kb ≈ x² / (0.025) → x² = Kb * 0.025 = 5.405e-10 * 0.025 = 1.35125e-11 → x = sqrt(1.35125e-11) ≈ 3.677e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.677e-6 → pOH = -log(3.677e-6) ≈ 5.433. So pH = 14 - 5.433 ≈ 8.567.

Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. But wait, maybe my calculation is a bit off. Let me compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(1.35125e-11).

Let me compute 1.35125e-
