Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to identify the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I should probably draw the structures of the starting material and the target compound to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, seems a bit complex. Let me parse that name.

So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, there's a substituent at the 1-position (the same carbon as the aldehyde). That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which means a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be the aldehyde on the cyclohexane, and a side chain that's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. The full substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is a methyl group with two groups attached: a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl. So, the structure would be:

The cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) on one carbon. On the same carbon, there's a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group attached. So, that carbon has three substituents: the aldehyde, the cyclohexyl, and the hydroxyl.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group: so, the main carbon (the one where the aldehyde is) has a CH2 group attached. But that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of functional groups and reaction mechanisms.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: that's cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl) substituent. So, it's CH2C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane? Or is it more like cyclohexane with a sp-hybridized carbon attached to another carbon? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, attached to the cyclohexane.

So, the target is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group on a methyl chain attached to the aldehyde carbon.

I think the synthesis steps would involve modifying the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about what reagents are used in the options.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, (CH3)2S, Li, liquid NH3, etc.

Hmm. Let me think about what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in alkyne chemistry. It can induce elimination or deprotonate to form an alkyne.

Methyl chloride is a methylating agent, but when used with a strong base like NaNH2, it's likely for alkylation, perhaps in a Grignard-like reaction or for forming methyl ethers or methyl esters. Wait, NaNH2 is also used in dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. If I treat it with a strong base, like NaNH2, I might form an alkyne with an adjacent leaving group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps deprotonating the terminal alkyne.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Oh wait, no: ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon. So, it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the molecule is ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and another carbon. So, structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH attached to a carbon on the ring?

Wait, no, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡C-CH3? No, that's propargyl. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So, it's cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon (which is CH). So, the structure is:

cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Now, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the target as cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1. Also, at position 1, there's a CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, meaning a methyl group with both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group attached. So, it's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the aldehyde is on a carbon that's connected to a CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the steps required. The starting material is an alkyne. To get to the target, which has an aldehyde group, perhaps we need to perform some oxidation or functional group transformations.

Also, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, which suggests some ring-forming or perhaps a coupling reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group. Alkyne to ketone or aldehyde.

A common way to convert an alkyne to a carbonyl is via the hydrolysis of the alkyne, perhaps using mercury-based reagents, like HgSO4 and H2SO4, which would oxidize the alkyne to a ketone or carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, ozonolysis of an alkyne could give different products, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but let's consider the options given. Let's go through each option and see which makes sense.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is CH3Cl. This sounds like an alkylation. Possibly, it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But wait, where would the proton come from? The alkyne's acidic alpha protons. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, giving an acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, leading to a new alkyne.

Wait, starting with ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Treating with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^- + NH2^-.

Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl), the acetylide would attack, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡CCH3. So, the alkyne becomes propargyl cyclohexane.

Then, step 2: H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing the triple bond. Using H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but propargyl is -CH2-C≡CH. Wait, wait the structure after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexyl and the methyl.

Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens, turning it into a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or maybe cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, after step 1, the alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡CCH3. Hydrogenation would convert that to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait: triple bond is between C1 (cyclohexyl) and C2. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond to make a single bond, so it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule becomes a straight chain: cyclohexyl attached to CH2, then another CH2, then CH3.

Wait, but that's not possible because adding two H2s to the triple bond would make a single bond. So, propargyl (C≡C) becomes CH2CH2? No, wait, no, the triple bond is between two carbons. So, after hydrogenation, the triple bond would become a single bond, but the number of carbons remains the same. So, (cyclohexyl)C≡CCH3 would become (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. The triple bond is between two carbons: C1 (cyclohexyl) and C2 (CH3). So, the molecule is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond, so C1 and C2 become CH2 and CH2, but wait, that's not possible because each carbon in the triple bond has two other bonds. Wait, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the product after step 1. Let's think again: starting with cyclohexyl-C≡CH, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne's terminal proton to form the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-), then methyl chloride would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne is now between the cyclohexyl and a methyl group.

Hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps the cyclohexyl group is attached to a -CH2-CH2-CH3 via a single bond. Wait, but that would make it cyclohexylpropane, which doesn't seem relevant to the target molecule.

Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, like forming epoxides or in the Birch reduction. Alternatively, it could be used for saponification, but that's more for esters. Wait, perhaps it's used for epoxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used for elimination, like forming a double bond.

Then, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Those reagents are typical for the oxymercuration reaction, where an alkyne is hydrolyzed in the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4 to form a ketone or carboxylic acid. Wait, but after step 2, we have a single bond, so perhaps step 3 and 4 are about oxidation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost here. Let's look at the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that has a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group on a methyl.

So, perhaps during the synthesis, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and some kind of substitution or addition happens to introduce the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Let me think about the other options.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. That would form an ethyl-substituted acetylide. Then, Li and liquid NH3 is a condition for elimination, perhaps forming a triple bond again or maybe a different structure. Then ozonolysis and workup.

But the target requires an aldehyde group, so ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with H2O and NH4OH) would give aldehydes. Hmm, maybe breaking a double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Let's consider each step.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Deprotonate the alkyne to form cyclohexyl-C≡C^-, then ethyl chloride would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a condition for elimination—like deprotonation to form a stronger base, leading to elimination. For example, in a dehydrohalogenation or for forming alkenes via elimination. Wait, but after step 1, we have an alkyne. So, perhaps step 2 is something else.

Wait, Li in NH3 is a common condition for Birch reductions, but that's for aromatics. Alternatively, maybe it's for forming Grignard reagents, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's for elimination to form a more substituted alkyne.

Wait, maybe it's a deprotonation that leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. But I'm not certain.

Then step 3: O3 (ozone) followed by H2O. Ozonolysis is used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. But I thought step 2 was using Li/NH3, which could be for elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, but no, H2/Pd is for hydrogenation. Wait, no, step 2 in option B is Li/NH3, which is a different condition.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for isomerization. For example, converting the alkyne to an alkene via some mechanism.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let's move to option D.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3, (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent. So, deprotonate the alkyne, form the acetylide, then treat with methanol to form the methyl ether? Or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If the alkyne is treated with NaNH2, the terminal proton is removed, forming the acetylide. Then, methanol would provide a methyl group. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl group, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol as an electrophile, leading to a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methylating agent. But methanol isn't a great methylating agent; perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think of another angle.

Another approach is to think about the target molecule's structure and think backwards. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group and a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. Grignard reagents can add to carbonyl groups to form alcohols. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone or aldehyde, then adding a Grignard reagent.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think about the steps involved in converting an alkyne into the desired aldehyde.

Another point is that the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon. That sounds like a protection and then a reaction, but perhaps it's formed via an oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves the addition of a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl, followed by oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via a hydrolysis reaction.

Let me think about the possible reagents again. HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water (step 4 in option A) is a condition for the oxymercuration of alkynes, which converts them into ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions.

Wait, when an alkyne is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water, it undergoes hydration to form a ketone. So, for example, R-C≡CH + reagent → R-CO-H (ketone). But if the alkyne is between two R groups, then the product would be a ketone.

Wait, let's say after step 1 in option A, the alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which would be for hydration of a triple bond — but wait, after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So that doesn't make sense. So option A might not be correct.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 1 is same as option A: form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3. Step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond, perhaps to a single bond, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. But after step 2, the molecule is a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then methylating? Maybe leading to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps forming a methyl ester or ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a ketone via some mechanism. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for eliminations or reductions. But perhaps in this case, it's used to deprotonate and form a more substituted alkyne.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Then, step 4: NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for hydrolysis.

But I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a cyclohexyl group to a hydroxymethyl group attached to the aldehyde carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition: adding a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide to an aldehyde to form a secondary alcohol, but then oxidizing or modifying it.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, converting the alkyne into a ketone, then performing some kind of addition to introduce the substituent.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule's substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group which also has a hydroxyl group. That suggests that the substituent is a cyclohexyl-substituted alcohol attached to the main chain.

Perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol, then oxidizing it to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, further reactions could lead to the aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again, focusing on the steps.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2 with ethyl chloride, then Li/NH3, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

So, after step 1, the alkyne becomes longer: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li/NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for deprotonation or elimination. Perhaps it's used to form a trans-alkene via elimination.

Wait, step 2 could be converting the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, but NaNH2 and ethyl chloride gave us a longer alkyne. Then, Li/NH3 is a condition for elimination, perhaps turning the alkyne into a trans-alkene.

So, after step 2, we have a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? Wait, no, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure how that would work here.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by a coupling reaction.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. If after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

For example, if step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not certain.

If the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For instance, if the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, that's a single bond, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by some elimination to form a more substituted alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group which is attached to an aldehyde. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing the cyclohexyl group via some substitution or addition.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option D.

Option D: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2 methanol; Li/LiNH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne becomes an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3. Hmm, but that's an ether formation, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe that's a Birch reduction, but that's typically for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it could be used to form a trans-alkene from the alkyne. Wait, if you have an alkyne and treat it with a strong base like Li in NH3, it can deprotonate and form a more substituted alkyne. Or perhaps it's for elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not exactly sure.

Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for hydrolysis.

But I'm still not seeing the connection to the target molecule. Maybe I should think about how the aldehyde is formed.

Wait, another approach: the target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that a ketone or aldehyde precursor was oxidized or underwent some reaction.

Let me think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. So, cyclohexane attached to a carbon with a triple bond (C≡CH). The target has an aldehyde on cyclohexane, and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some addition or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a specific reaction.

Wait, the target's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. That suggests that the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol via a Grignard addition, then oxidizing the alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction, where an OH group is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via hydroxylation. Ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S) would give aldehydes, and a subsequent reaction could introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via an epoxide opening or some other mechanism.

Another thought: perhaps the synthesis involves a cyclopropane ring-opening or some kind of [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a hydroxyalkylation of the aldehyde. So, after forming the aldehyde, adding a hydroxymethyl group that's also substituted with cyclohexyl.

Hmm.

Wait, going back to the options. Let's think about option D's steps:

After step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne becomes an acetylide, then reacts with methanol to form an ether? Or perhaps the acetylide attacks a methyl group, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3-O-... Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a deprotonation and alkylation, leading to a longer alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a deprotonation, then a substitution with methanol as the electrophile. So, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) would attack a methyl group from methanol, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. Hmm, that might form a methyl ether.

Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this is for deprotonation again, or perhaps for elimination to form a more substituted alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction to form a diene, but that's more for aromatic rings.

Hmm, I'm not getting much progress. Let's think about the target again. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so maybe it's formed via a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

Suppose the molecule is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol on the same carbon, which suggests that perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of an alcohol.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a series of reactions. For example, hydration of the alkyne to a ketone, followed by reduction to an alcohol, then oxidation to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group, then adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reaction.

Let me think about option C.

Option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenation to (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then, step 3: ozone with (CH3)2S. But after step 2, the molecule is a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this option doesn't make sense.

Option B: steps are NaNH2 ethyl chloride; Li/NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

After step 1, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3, perhaps for elimination, forming a trans-alkene.

Wait, treating an alkyne with Li/NH3 could lead to the formation of a trans-alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

If step 2 forms a trans-alkene, then ozonolysis in step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene is between the cyclohexyl and the ethyl group, ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups.

Then, step 4: NH4OH, which is used in the workup for ozonolysis, perhaps leading to the formation of aldehydes.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group. Maybe this is the right path.

Wait, let me imagine the structure after each step.

Start: cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this deprotonates and forms a trans-alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact transformation. Let's assume that step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is at the end, so the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, for example.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it, producing two carbonyl groups. So, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the starting material after step 2 is a longer chain, perhaps something like cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. For example, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then ozonolysis would produce a cyclohexyl-CHO and another aldehyde group.

But the target has a single aldehyde group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps ozonolysis would produce a single aldehyde group on the cyclohexane ring. Let's imagine that. After ozonolysis, the cyclohexane ring would have an aldehyde group attached.

Then, step 4: NH4OH would work up the ozonolysis, perhaps hydrolyzing any ozonides to form the aldehyde.

But then, where does the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group come from? Maybe I'm missing a step.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a substitution reaction. For example, after forming the aldehyde, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution occurs where a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group are introduced.

But I'm not seeing a clear path. Maybe I should try to think about each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option D again: steps are NaNH2 and methanol, Li/NH3, ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, and then NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. The alkyne becomes an acetylide, which attacks methanol, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Perhaps this forms a Grignard-like reagent, adding to the carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings but I don't think it's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation leading to elimination, forming a trans-alkene.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. For example, if the molecule has a double bond between the cyclohexyl and another group, ozonolysis would form two aldehydes.

But I'm not seeing how the substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) would form.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent is introduced via a substitution reaction after the aldehyde is formed. For example, after forming the aldehyde, a hydroxyl group is added via hydroboration or another method, and then a cyclohexyl group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via an epoxide-opening reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about each step again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms acetylide, then methylates to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3: perhaps deprotonates to form a stronger base, then eliminates to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves a double bond to form aldehydes.

4. NH4OH: hydrolyzes any remaining ozonides.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Another thought: maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, after forming an aldehyde, adding a Grignard reagent would form a secondary alcohol, which could then be oxidized or modified.

But given the time I've spent, I think I need to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the target has an aldehyde and a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group attached to a methyl.

Which of the options provides a pathway to form such a structure?

Option D's steps include ozonolysis, which could form an aldehyde. Then, perhaps the substituent is added via a Grignard reaction. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is formed via a substitution after ozonolysis.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, option B's steps include ozonolysis, which might form an aldehyde, and then a hydroxyl group via NH4OH.

Wait, ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S) gives aldehydes. Then, perhaps in another step, a substitution could add the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to the aldehyde, but I don't see that in the steps.

Wait, option D's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup leading to aldehydes. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which might be aqueous workup, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the substituent has a cyclohexyl group, which suggests that a cyclohexane ring was introduced via some reaction, perhaps via a coupling reaction or via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxylation of a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to think about the possible correct option based on the reagents.

The target has an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol. So, the aldehyde could be formed via ozonolysis of a double bond (from an alkyne that was hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene), and the secondary alcohol could be formed via a Grignard addition.

Looking at the options, option D uses ozonolysis and then NH4OH. So, if the alkyne is converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis would form the aldehyde. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to form the secondary alcohol.

But how? Let's see option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond to form an aldehyde.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolyzing any remaining groups.

But I'm not seeing the formation of the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution on the aldehyde carbon after it's formed.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxylation reaction. For example, using OsO4 for dihydroxylation of a double bond, but that isn't present in the options.

Given that I'm not making progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the possible reagent sequences.

The correct sequence likely involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde) and then adding the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Looking at the options, option D includes ozonolysis which would form an aldehyde. Then, perhaps a Grignard reaction could add a cyclohexyl group to form the substituent.

Wait, but in option D, after ozonolysis, there's no Grignard step. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution after the aldehyde is formed. But I'm not certain.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and I'll have to choose the best option based on the reagents.

The correct sequence likely is option D. Let me explain.

Wait, option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: forms acetylide and methylates to (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves the double bond to form aldehyde groups.

4. NH4OH: hydrolyzes any remaining ozonides, perhaps forming the aldehyde on the cyclohexane.

But where does the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group come from? Maybe I'm missing that in this process.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction after step 3.

Wait, perhaps after step 3, we have an aldehyde. Then, a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) is added, followed by hydrolysis to form the secondary alcohol.

But none of the options include a Grignard reagent addition. So this might not fit.

Hmm, I'm not confident, but I think the correct answer is option D.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the key steps involve converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and introducing the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.  
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.  
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely induces elimination or substitution, but the exact transformation is unclear.  
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration of a triple bond, but the triple bond was already hydrogenated in step 2. This sequence does not align with the target structure.

### Option B:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₂CH₃.  
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Possibly eliminates to form a trans-alkene.  
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl groups.  
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes ozonides to aldehydes.  
This sequence could form an aldehyde but does not account for the introduction of the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl substituent.

### Option C:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.  
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in (cyclohexyl)CH₂-CH₃.  
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive workup forms aldehydes, but the triple bond was already hydrogenated in step 2.  
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Unclear role in forming the target structure. This sequence is inconsistent with the target.

### Option D:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C-OCH₃.  
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Possibly eliminates to form a trans-alkene.  
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes.  
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes ozonides to aldehydes.  
This sequence aligns with the formation of an aldehyde but does not explicitly address the introduction of the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl substituent. However, it is the most plausible option among those provided.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most reasonable sequence of reagents to synthesize the target compound, despite some uncertainties in the exact formation of the substituent.
