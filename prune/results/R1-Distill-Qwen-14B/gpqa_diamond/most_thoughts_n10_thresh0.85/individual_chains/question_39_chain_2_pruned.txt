Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function for a particle in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, they didn't find any in x <1 or x>3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function needs to be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. So that's the normalization condition. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set that equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's find its absolute square, which is ψ*(x)ψ(x). The complex conjugate of ψ is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, the real parts would be (a^2)/(1+x) because when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x))*(a/sqrt(1+x)) you get a²/(1+x). Then the imaginary parts: (0.5i)*(-0.5i) = 0.25*(i^2) = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. But wait, when you multiply the two, the cross terms would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) + (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i), right? Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the multiplication is (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i). Let me compute that correctly.

Let me think, (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B². So A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5i. So the product is A² - B². So A² is (a²)/(1 + x), and B² is (0.5i)^2 = (0.5)^2*(i)^2 = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So ψ*ψ is [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) + (0.5i)*(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Let's compute term by term.

First term: (a²)/(1+x).
Second term: -0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).
Third term: +0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).
Fourth term: (-0.5i)(0.5i) = -0.25 i² = +0.25 because i² is -1.

Oh wait, the second and third terms cancel each other because they are negatives. So the cross terms go away. So ψ*ψ = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait, that would make the absolute square ψ*ψ = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. Hmm, that's an interesting result. So when we integrate |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3, it's the integral of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

And this must equal 1 because the wave function is normalized. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.693147.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait a second. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, I have to square the modulus correctly.

Wait,
