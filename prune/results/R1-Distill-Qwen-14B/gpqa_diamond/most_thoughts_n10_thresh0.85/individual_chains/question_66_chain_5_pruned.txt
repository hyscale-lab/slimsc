Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that effective field theories are constructed to respect certain fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model. So what symmetries are those? Well, the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Lorentz symmetry is a big one because it's part of the framework of relativity.

Then there's Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Oh right, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So if Poincare is a bigger symmetry, then if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it includes Lorentz. But if they are separate options, maybe both are required?

Wait no, the SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry because it includes the Lorentz group and translations. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they respect Lorentz symmetry as well. So if an operator violates Lorentz, it would violate Poincare. So I think that both must be respected, but Poincare includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the question is, which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must individually respect these symmetries. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it can't be part of the SMEFT. Same with Poincare. But wait, can an operator respect Poincare without respecting Lorentz? No, because Poincare includes Lorentz. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it can't respect Poincare either. So maybe the question is whether both must be enforced, but I think Poincare is a larger symmetry already. So perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz is also preserved.

Wait, but the options include 1 (
