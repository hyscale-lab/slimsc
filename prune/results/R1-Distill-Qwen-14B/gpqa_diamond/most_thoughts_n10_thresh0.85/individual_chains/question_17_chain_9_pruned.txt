Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds with calcium ions. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in the form that can bind the metal ion effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard conditions, so maybe activity coefficients are around 1 or something. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, the problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So when EDTA binds calcium, it forms a complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, the total EDTA includes both the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca. So let's think about it.

I remember that for a complex like CaY^2- (where Y is EDTA), the concentration of calcium ions can be found if you know the formation constant and the total concentration of the complex. The total concentration here is 0.02 M, which is [CaY^2-].

So the formula is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y]). But wait, the total EDTA is [Y_total] = [Y] + [CaY^2-]. Hmm, but in this case, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh wait! Stoichiometric usually means that the moles of EDTA and Ca are in a 1:1 ratio. So the solution is made by adding just enough EDTA to completely complex the Ca, but wait no—wait, the question says 0.02 M is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total Ca is all in the complex, or is some free?

Wait, no. If the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, then that's the concentration of the complex. But in solution, some of the EDTA might not be bound to Ca. Wait, no, in a stoichiometric solution, I think the main species is the complex. But wait, the EDTA could be in excess or not, but in this case, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So perhaps the total EDTA is 0.02 M, but that can't be because EDTA is a ligand and Ca is a metal. Wait, no, the complex is [CaY]^2-.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me denote [CaY^2-] as 0.02 M. Because that's the given concentration of the complex. Then, the formation constant equation is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But what's [Y^4-]? Well, the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA (Y^4-) and the complex (CaY^2-). So [Y_total] = [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-]. But wait, wait, is the solution made by adding Ca and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts? Or is the 0.02 M the concentration of the complex, which implies that the EDTA is in excess?

Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. That's a bit unclear. "Stoichiometric" might mean that the amounts of Ca and EDTA are just right to form the complex without any excess. So for every mole of Ca, there's a mole of EDTA. So in that case, the total EDTA would be [EDTA] = [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-]. But since the complex is 0.02 M, and if it's stoichiometric, then [EDTA_total] is equal to [CaY^2-], because each Ca is bound to one EDTA. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if all EDTA is bound, the free EDTA would be zero, which can't be right because K is large, so the complex is stable, but in reality, a tiny bit of free EDTA might exist.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant K is 5e10. We need to find [Ca^2+].

The formation constant equation is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But [Y^4-] is the free EDTA. Since EDTA is a weak acid, pH affects its form, but the question says pH is ideal, so [Y^4-] is at its maximum, and perhaps we can
