Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to the correct formula.

First, let me go through each piece of information one by one. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, the broadness—carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because it's acidic and easily dissociates. Alcohols also have a broad O-H, but maybe less so. Another peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). Then, another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1650 is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone or aldehyde. Maybe an ester or maybe conjugated carbonyl groups? Or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like in a conjugated system. Alternatively, a conjugated carbonyl could lower the wavenumber.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, possibly conjugated with something else, maybe the carbonyl.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. So, what fragments could give a mass of 45? Let's think. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12+16+12+16+1?) Wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH3)2O has a molecular weight of (12*2 + 1*6 + 16) = 46. Oh wait, 45? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetyl group (CH3CO) which is 43. Hmm. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion or a fragment could lose some groups. Let me think about possible structures.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's look at their molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation? Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C6H12O2: The formula is CnH2mOx. The formula is C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation calculation is: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees—could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14-12)/2=1.

So from the NMR, we know there's a vinyl group (a double bond, so at least one degree of unsaturation). The IR shows a carbonyl (another degree), so that's two degrees. So in the compound, there must be at least two degrees, so the options must have at least two degrees. Let me check.

Option A: 1 degree. Not enough because we have a double bond (vinyl) and a carbonyl. So that can't be right. So A is out.

Option B: 2 degrees. That's possible. So maybe a double bond (vinyl) and a carbonyl, which would account for two.

Option C: 2 degrees. That's possible too.

Option D: 1 degree. Not enough, same as A.

So the possible options are B and C. Now, looking at the IR, the carbonyl at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is higher, so maybe a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated system. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, like an enone.

The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggest a double bond adjacent to something else. Maybe adjacent to the carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. So structures like cyclohexenone derivatives or similar.

Looking at the mass spec: m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, in an ester, if the molecule breaks into a smaller part. The fragment at 45 could be the mass of a ketene ion, perhaps, or a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO-O- something. Wait, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's try to think of a structure for C6H10O2 with a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula for each option:

A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72 +12 +32=116.

B: C6H10O. (6*12)+(10*1)+16=72+10+16=98.

C: C6H10O2. (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

D: C6H12O. (6*12)+(12)+(16)=72+12+16=100.

The mass spec shows a peak at m/z 45. So which of these could lose a group to give 45?

Wait, the molecular ion is usually the highest m/z. So if the molecular ion is, say, 114 (for option C), a fragment at 45 would imply losing 69 (114-45=69) or maybe more steps. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a smaller part.

Wait, 45 is the same as the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58, no). Wait, wait. Let me calculate.

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see: Possible structures with a molecular weight of 45. Maybe (CH3)2O, which is 45? Wait, (CH3)2O: (2*12) + (6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Nope, 46. So that's not it.

Another possibility: CH3COOH would be 60. Hmm. Wait, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion? Or perhaps a CH3CO group minus something. Wait, CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12*2 + 3*1 +16 = 24 +3 +16=43). So 45 is 43 plus 2? Not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from a benzene ring losing some groups, but the options are all C6, so maybe it's a cyclohexene derivative.

Wait, another approach: What's the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2. Let's think of a possible structure. Maybe something like methyl cyclohex-2-enone? No, wait, cyclohex-2-enone would be C6H8O, but with another oxygen? Alternatively, perhaps an ester with a double bond. Like methyl vinyl ether? No, that would be OCH2CH2O... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But that would have a ring, which would account for a degree of unsaturation.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. That suggests two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another group. Wait, 1700 could be an ester or ketone. 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated groups, like in a carbonyl compound. Or maybe an amide, but the options don't have N, so probably not.

Wait, another thought. If there's a conjugated diene, maybe. But the NMR shows vinyl protons, which are on a double bond. Let me think of structures with a conjugated enone (double bond next to a carbonyl). For example, cyclohexenone has a double bond conjugated with the ketone. Its structure is (cyclohexyl with a ketone and a double bond). Molecular formula for cyclohexenone is C6H8O. But the options don't have C6H8O. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the options for O2 include C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. Let's think of something like methyl vinyl ketone. Its formula is C4H6O. But that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe a diethyl ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which has a ring and an ester group. For example, a six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H8O2. But again, that's not matching any of the options. The options are C6H12O2 which is 116, but C6H8O2 would be 104. Alternatively, maybe a substituted ester with more hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the compound is a substituted ester with a vinyl group. Let's think of methyl acrylate. Its formula is C4H6O2. But again, not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Let me see. For example, if it's cyclohexene with an ester group. Let me calculate the formula. If it's something like cyclohexene with an ester (O2), then the formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding an ester (COO...) would add O2 and subtract H2? Wait, not sure. Let me think again. Ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for cyclohexene (C6H10) with an ester group, perhaps replacing one H with the ester. So, molecular formula would be C6H10O2. That's option C.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond (vinyl H's in NMR) and an ester group (which would have a carbonyl, so the IR peaks at 1700 and another peak for conjugation, perhaps? Or maybe another carbonyl group).

Alternatively, if the ester is conjugated with the double bond, the carbonyl peak might shift. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl could be at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond's stretching (C=C) would be around 1650. So the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 might correspond to the ester carbonyl and the conjugated double bond (C=C).

That seems plausible. So the structure would have an ester group and a conjugated double bond.

Now, the mass spec fragment at m/z 45. If the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment, perhaps the ester group contributes. The ester part is O-CO-O. But perhaps the fragment is from the acylium ion. The acylium ion would have a mass of (COOH) minus something. Wait, wait. Let's think about the possibility of the ester group breaking off. If the molecule is an ester, say, R-O-CO-R', then a cleavage could occur at the ester oxygen, leading to two fragments. One could be R-O- and the other CO-R'.

The CO-R' part would have a molecular weight of (12+16) + (R' mass). For example, if R' is CH2CH2..., but perhaps a simpler case. Alternatively, the fragment could be the acetyl group (43), but that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The molecular formula of option C is C6H10O2. If it's an ester with a vinyl group, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 or similar. Alternatively, maybe a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structures and how they would fragment. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, when the molecule breaks, perhaps the conjugated system breaks, leading to a fragment. Alternatively, the ester group could break off, producing a smaller fragment.

Wait, for the fragment at m/z 45. Let me think of possible ions. 45 is 45. So that's a molecular weight of 45. What's a group with 45? Let's calculate.

Possible candidates:

- CH3COOH: 60. No.

- (CH3)2CO: 58. No.

- CH3COO-: 43 (but would be [CH3COO-]⁻, which is 43, but in positive ions, perhaps 44 or 45? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The fragment could be CH3CH2CO (propanoyl group). That would be 12*3 + 1*6 +16= 36+6+16=58. No.

Wait, what about CH2COOCH3? That's methyl propenoate? No, wait. Wait, no, methyl propenoate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Molecular formula is C5H6O2. Hmm, but our compound is C6H10O2. Maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. The acylium ion is R-CO⁺. The molecular weight of that would be R's weight plus 43 (since CO is 28, but the acylium is R-C⁺=O, so 43? Wait, maybe I should think of specific examples. For example, acetone's acylium would be (CH3)2CO⁺, which is 58. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller ion. Suppose the molecular ion is at 114 (option C: 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2 O=32 → 72+10+32=114). If the molecule loses 69, 114-69=45. So the fragment would be m/z 45. But 69 is the molecular weight of something like cyclohexanol (C6H12O) which is 100. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: what's the molecular formula for each option, and what are their possible degrees of unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2 → degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees: could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

If the structure has a double bond and an ester group (which is a carbonyl), that accounts for two degrees.

So back to the spectral data.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 → O-H (maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Wait, but in an ester, the O-H is from an alcohol, but in an ester, the O-H is usually deprotonated or not present. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, wait. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R', so they don't have an O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 can't be from an ester. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the options don't have any with -OH except options A and C, which have O2. Or wait, the options are:

A) C6H12O2 → could be ester, which doesn't have O-H; or could be a diol (two -OH groups), but diols don't have broad peaks unless they're in a cyclic structure maybe. Or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H peak, which matches the description.

But the problem is, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000. In a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is very broad and around 2500-3300. So that fits.

But then, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm⁻¹, which matches the first peak. But where's the second peak at 1650? Carboxylic acids don't typically have that. Maybe it's an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system. So, if the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, the IR would show the C=O at 1700 and the C=C at around 1650.

But wait, the options:

Option A is C6H12O2. If it's a diester, maybe. But diesters don't have O-H. Or maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a ring and an ester, but lactones don't have O-H.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, another possibility: The broad peak at 3000 could be from an alcohol (-OH). So the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But if it's an alcohol, the O-H peak is usually less broad than a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if the alcohol is in a cyclic structure, like a cyclic ether, but that doesn't have O-H.

Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, but the options don't have benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the compound has both an alcohol and a carbonyl group, like a ketone. But the options don't have that, looking at the formulas.

Wait, maybe the FTIR has other peaks. Let me re-examine the FTIR data. It shows a very broad peak at 3000, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The broad peak suggests an O-H group, but in which functional group? If it's a carboxylic acid, yes. But if it's an alcohol, the O-H is less broad.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the compound is a beta-keto acid, which has both a carboxylic acid group and a ketone. But I don't know if that matches the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an -OH in an ether, but that's not typical. No, ethers don't have O-H.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an amide, but the options don't have N.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures include an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons. Wait, no. Let me think of a six-carbon compound with an ester and a double bond.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula of option C is C6H10O2. Let me calculate the possible structure. Maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But a six-membered lactone would have the formula C5H8O2, I think. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ester, like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Let's see: cyclohexene is C6H10. If it's a carboxylate ester, the formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, because cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding a COOCH3 group would add (COOCH3) which is 3 O and 1 more C? Wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. The ester would be something like O=C-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 or similar. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclopentene with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think about the possible fragments. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. So losing 114-45=69. So what's 69? 69 is, for example, C4H9O. That's butanol (4 carbons, 9 H, 1 O). So if the molecule loses a butanol group, leaving a fragment of 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts: one part being a small ester, like methyl acetate (which is 88). No, 88 is higher than 45.

Wait, wait. Another way: the fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion. A ketene has the formula R-C=C=O. The fragment would have a molecular weight of (R) + (C=C=O). For example, if R is CH3, the fragment would be CH3-C=C=O, which is (12*4 + 1*4 + 16) = 48 +4 +16=68? Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43. But the peak is at 45. Hmm, maybe it's a CH3CO-O- group, but that's 60.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CHCOO- group, which is 72. No, that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the other data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The IR has a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at
