Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Then, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I need to normalize the given state |alpha>, because right now it's just proportional to that combination. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Wait, no, wait. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So |1+i|² is (1² + 1²) = 2, and |2-i|² is (2² + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix where the diagonal is zero and off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. It's A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2}, right? So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues. Let me think: the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for A, which is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of A. Because the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate are the square of the absolute values of the coefficients when |alpha> is written in that basis.

So first, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>

Where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

The eigenstates of A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write:

|alpha> = c |+x> + d |−x>

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>, we have:

|alpha> = c (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + d (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ (c + d)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c − d)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But from earlier, |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, so:

a = (c + d)/sqrt(2)  → equation 1
b = (c - d)/sqrt(2)  → equation 2

I can solve these two equations for c and d.

Adding equations 1 and 2: a + b = 2c / sqrt(2) → c = (a + b) * sqrt(2)/2

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from 1: a - b = 2d / sqrt(2) → d = (a - b) * sqrt(2)/2

Let me compute a + b and a - b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a + b = [1 +i + 2 -i ] / sqrt(7) → (3)/sqrt(7) = 3/sqrt(7)

a - b = [1 +i -2 +i ] / sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7)

So,

c = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/2 = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

But wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7? Wait, sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b). So sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7? No, wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7, because sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7.

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(7))) = sqrt(14)/7. So,

c = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/(2) = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3 sqrt(14) / (2 *7) )? Wait, maybe it's better to just compute the numerical factors.

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414 and sqrt(7) is about 2.6458. But perhaps I can just leave it in terms of sqrt(14), since sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14).

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's calculate c and d.

Compute c:

c = (a + b) * (sqrt(2)/2 )

a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / sqrt(7)

So c = [3/sqrt(7)] * [sqrt(2)/2 ] = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, d = (a - b) * (sqrt(2)/2 )

a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)

So d = [ (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) ] * (sqrt(2)/2 ) = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))

But perhaps I should compute the squared magnitudes |c|^2 and |d|^2 to find the probabilities.

So |c|^2 is |3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))|^2.

Wait, 3^2 is 9, (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, (2 sqrt(7))^2 is 4*7=28. So 9 * 2 / (28) ) = 18/28 = 9/14.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute |c|^2:

c = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

So |c|^2 = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7) ) → 18/(28) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

And |d|^2 is [ | (-1 +2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) | ]^2.

The numerator's magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5. Multiply by (sqrt(2))^2 → 5*2=10.

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))^2 = 4 *7=28.

So |d|^2 = 10 /28 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are |c|^2=9/14 ≈0.6428 and |d|^2=5/14≈0.357.

But wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → 0.64 + 0.36 =1. Close. But perhaps precise fractions would matter.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So that's matching option A's first two numbers, 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the next part is the average value of the operator. The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, its average is given by the expectation value.

But wait, A is (ħ/2) σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it using the expansion in |+x> and |−x> states.

Since A acts on |+x> as (ħ/2) |+x>, and on |−x> as -(ħ/2) |−x>.

So, the expectation value is c* (ħ/2) c* + d* (-ħ/2) d* ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expectation value <A> is the sum over the eigenstates' contributions, weighted by their probabilities.

So, <A> = |c|^2 * (+ħ/2) + |d|^2 * (-ħ/2)

Because |+x> has eigenvalue +ħ/2, |−x> eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So, <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 → (4 * ħ/2 ) /14 → (2 ħ ) /14 → ħ/7.

Hmm, so the average is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64,
