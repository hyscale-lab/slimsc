Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. Let's see what information I have.

The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. Oh wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what's the next state? I think in such models, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational, but the next state might be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So, the next state with the lowest energy could be the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). But which transition gives a lower energy photon?

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. Hmm. Momentum p is related to energy via E = pc, since for a photon, E = hf and p = E/c. So if I can find the energy difference between the states, I can compute p.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the smallest possible energy increment. So, which transition requires less energy: a vibrational or a rotational transition?

Vibrational energy transitions usually have higher energy differences because the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out. For example, the energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. The spacing between adjacent vibrational levels is h w. So the energy needed to go from n=0 to n=1 is h w.

For rotational transitions, the energy levels are E_rot = [ (J)(J+1) - (J-1)J ] h c / (8 pi^2 I), but wait, when J increases by 1, the change in energy is from J to J+1. The energy difference between J and J+1 is [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] (h c)/(8 pi² I) ). Simplifying, it's [2J+2] (h c)/(8 pi² I) )? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the energy difference between J and J+1 is E_{J+1} - E_J = B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = B [ (J^2 + 3J +2) - (J^2 + J) ) ] = B (2J + 2).

So the energy difference depends on J. For the lowest transition, J=0 to J=1: delta E = B (0 + 0 + 2) = 2B.

But wait, B is given by B = h²/(8 π² I c), but wait, no, the rotational constant is B = ℏ²/(2 I ), where ℏ is h/(2 pi), so B = (h^2)/(8 pi² I).

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J +1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I c) ), but I think I'm mixing up some constants. Wait, perhaps in the energy expression, E_J = (h² J (J+1) )/(8 π² I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me get the right formula. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So yeah, I need to compute that first.

So let's compute I: I = μ R².

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ around 3.015 (since 1.8 *1.66 is around 2.988, but 1.818*1.6605 is about 3.015). So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

Then, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is (h²)/(8 π² I ). Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ about 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² is about 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator is 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.206e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me do the calculation more accurately: 78.9568 * 1.206e-46 = approx 78.9568 *1.206= around 95.3, so 95.3e-46.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (95.3e-46) ) = (4.39e-67) / (9.53e-45) ) [because 95.3e-46 is 9.53e-45? Wait, no. 95.3e-46 is 9.53e-45? Wait, 95.3e-46 is 9.53e-45 because 95.3e-46 = 95.3 *1e-46 = 9.53 * 1e-45.

So 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 = (4.39 / 9.53) ) * 1e-22 ≈ approximately 0.46 e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is:

delta E_rot = B [ (1)(2) - 0 ] = 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the vibrational transition delta E_vib is h w. Let's compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So delta E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, 2.65e-19 J for vibration, and 9.2e-23 J for rotation. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So if the molecule is in the ground state, which is n=0 and J=0, then the next possible transition with the lowest energy would be J=0 → J=1.

Wait, but wait: in some models, the vibrational transitions require that the rotational state can change as well. But the question seems to be more about the energy difference between states, regardless of whether they're rotation or vibration.

But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which of these requires a smaller photon energy?

As we saw, the rotational transition requires about 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires about 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have that lower energy.

Wait, but wait: the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be the next higher in the overall energy, which might involve a combination of both. But I think in this context, the question is considering the transition to the next state in either rotational or vibrational, whichever has the lower energy.

So the photon must supply the energy difference of either a rotational or vibrational transition. Since the rotational transition is smaller, that's the one to consider.

So the energy delta E is delta E_rot = 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

But wait, wait: in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy isn't just purely rotational; it's a combination. Hmm, but maybe the question is considering the main transition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it as either a vibrational or a rotational transition, and the minimal one is the rotational.

But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's not about the energy of the transition, but the next state's energy. For instance, the next state might be a vibrational transition to n=1, which is higher in energy than any rotational state. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next higher energy states would be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. But which of these is lower in energy?

Let me compute the energies.

E_vib for n=1 is (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w = (3/2)(6.626e-34 *4e14) = (3/2)(2.65e-19) = 3.975e-19 J.

E_rot for J=1 is B * 1*(1+1) = 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

So n=1, J=0: E = E_vib = 3.97e-19 J.

n=0, J=1: E = E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

So n=0, J=1 is a much lower energy state than n=1, J=0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is n=0, J=1.

Wait, but does that make sense? The energy levels would be ordered as J=0 (n=0), then J=1 (n=0), then J=2 (n=0), etc., and then the vibrational levels at higher n would come in. So, the next state after the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) is (n=0, J=1), which is much lower in energy than any vibrational state.

So the photon must supply the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

So delta E = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = 2B.

So delta E = 2 * (4.6e-23 J) = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave B as 4.6e-23 J, so delta E is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the momentum of the photon: since E = p c, and for a photon, p = E/(c). Because E = hf = pc.

So p = delta E / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are in the
