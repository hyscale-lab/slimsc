Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy required depends on the mass and velocity of the particles. The nucleus in question here is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the isotope would be Li-6, because lithium typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

I need to find the total energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. Oh right, from special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me compute v²/c² first. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me check that calculation. Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is about 3.5714. Right.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... Well, the atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². But wait, I should get the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, lithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass can be calculated using the sum of protons and neutrons. Each proton is about
