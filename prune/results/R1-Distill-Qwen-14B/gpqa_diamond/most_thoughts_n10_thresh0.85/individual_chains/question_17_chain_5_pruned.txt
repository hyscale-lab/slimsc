Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They're asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high Kf means the complex is stable, so the calcium is tightly bound.

So the setup here is that we have a solution where calcium and EDTA combine to form a complex. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But how much of that dissociates into calcium and EDTA?

Wait, no, wait. The problem states it's a stochiometric solution. Stochiometric means that the molar amounts are in exact proportions. So, in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M. But because it's a 1:1 ratio (I think EDTA is usually in a 1:1 ratio with metal ions), the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But wait, what's the dissociation here? The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or another form,
