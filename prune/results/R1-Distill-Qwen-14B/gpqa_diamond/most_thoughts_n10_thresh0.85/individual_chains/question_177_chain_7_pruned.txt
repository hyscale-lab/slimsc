Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. So, T1 = T2.

Now, the problem says that astronomers calculated the luminosities. Luminosity of a star usually depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, the L should be proportional to R². But wait, wait, the problem says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times larger, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So, the luminosity of Star_1 should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are around 2.23 to 2.35, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh, the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's moving directly towards or away from us at that speed, but Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! The Doppler shift could change the observed wavelength.

But wait, in the problem, it says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Hmm, but if Star_2 is moving, its actual emitted wavelength would be different before considering the Doppler shift. So I need to account for that.

Wait, let me clarify. The stars emit at their own peak wavelengths based on their temperatures. But because Star_2 is moving (with radial velocity of
