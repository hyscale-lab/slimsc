Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think means they are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. The question is asking me to compute two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, this is probably a 2x2 matrix.

First, I need to find the probabilities. Since the state is given in terms of |up> and |down>, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of these basis states. But wait, the state is proportional to that combination, so I should probably normalize it first. Because when probabilities are involved, the state needs to be a unit vector.

So, let's write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and then find its normalization factor. The normalization is done by taking the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product would be (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i), because when you take the conjugate of the coefficients, the first term becomes (1-i) and the second (2+i).

Wait, let me compute that:

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) +1*(-i) +i*(1) +i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

Second term: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2*2 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), making |alpha> = [1/(sqrt(7))] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the state is normalized, because the coefficients squared (modulus squared) sum to 1.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, this would be:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. Matrix representation is a bit tricky here. Let me think. If i is not equal to j, A_ij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So yes, the matrix would be:

0     hbar/2
hbar/2  0

So this operator is essentially sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices have 0 on the diagonal and 1 on the off-diagonal, but with a positive and negative sign. Wait, no, the actual Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for this operator, they would be hbar/2 * (+1) and hbar/2 * (-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait, the states are |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_x. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Right, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, these are the eigenstates of the operator in question.

So, the question is, what is the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates when we measure the operator whose matrix is as given.

In other words, our state |alpha> is expressed in the sigma_z basis (|up>, |down>), but the operator's eigenstates are in the sigma_x basis. So to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in the sigma_x eigenbasis and find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

So, step by step:

1. Express |alpha> in the |up>, |down> basis, which we've already done: |alpha> = (1+i)|up>/(sqrt(7)) + (2 -i)|down>/(sqrt(7)).

2. Find the eigenstates of the operator. Let's denote them as |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

3. Express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Then, the probabilities will be |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So, let's compute c_+ and c_-.

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

We have:

|alpha> = (a)|up> + (b)|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (a)|up> + b|down> = (a + b)|+x> + (a - b)|-x> / sqrt(2)

Wait, let's see:

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) |alpha> = (a + b) |+x> + (a - b) |-x>

So,

c_+ = (a + b)/sqrt(2)
c_- = (a - b)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So,

a + b = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / sqrt(7)
a - b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)

Wait,

Wait, (1 +i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 +i -i = 3.

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = 1-2 + i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

c_+ = (3)/sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) ) = 3/(sqrt(14))
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

So, the coefficients are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients should be c_+ and c_-, but perhaps I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |alpha> with |-x>, which gives the coefficients c_+ and c_-.

Yes. So,

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] [ (a, b) ]^T

But wait, in terms of the components:

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product with |alpha> is:

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] |alpha> 
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

<up|alpha> is a = (1 +i)/sqrt(7)
<down|alpha> is b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] 
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 +i + 2 -i) ] 
= (1/sqrt(14)) [3]
= 3/sqrt(14)

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ]

So,

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1 +i - 2 + i) ] 
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So,

c_+ = 3/sqrt(14)
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9 /14 ≈ 0.6429

Compute |c_-|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571

Wait, no. Wait, the modulus squared of a complex number a + b i is a² + b².

So, for c_-, which is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), the modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 (so approximately 0.64) and 5/14 ≈ 0.357 (around 0.36).

Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36. That matches.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, so 0.64 is correct when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36. So the probabilities would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of the operator.

The operator is A, with matrix elements zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) * <alpha | sigma_x | alpha>.

So, let's compute <sigma_x> = <alpha | sigma_x | alpha>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which in the standard basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, to compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>, first write |alpha> in the standard basis:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

So,

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * sigma_x * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Multiplying it out:

The product would be the first component of the row vector multiplied by the first column of sigma_x times the column vector, plus the second component times the second column of sigma_x times the column vector.

Wait, no, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we perform the matrix multiplication sigma_x * |alpha>, it swaps the components.

So,

sigma_x |alpha> = [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which is:

(1 -i)(2 -i) /7 + (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2.

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i.

= 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2 +3i + (-1) = (1) +3i.

So sum both terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

Divide by 7: 2/7.

So, <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Wait, no: the expectation value is (hbar/2) times <sigma_x>.

Wait, sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1, so its expectation value is 2/7. So, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar /7.

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the expectation value <A> = (hbar/2) * <sigma_x>.

Since <sigma_x> is 2/7, <A> is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar (1/7) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar /7.

So, putting it together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation of <sigma_x>.

Another approach: since the operator is A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation of sigma_x.

The expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> can also be found by another method.

The state |alpha> is in the sigma_z basis. So, sigma_x can be expressed in terms of |up> and |down> as:

sigma_x = |up><down| + |down><up|

So, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = <alpha| (|up><down| + |down><up| ) |alpha>
= <alpha|up><down|alpha> + <alpha|down><up|alpha>
= (a*) b + (b*) a

Where a = <alpha|up> = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = <alpha|down> = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

(a*) b = (1 -i)(2 -i)/7 = (1)(2) +1*(-i) -i*(2) +i^2*(-i) ?

Wait, no, (1-i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Similarly, (b*) a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So, <sigma_x> = 2/7, same as before. So, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So, yes, the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, the options for the probabilities are given as the first two numbers, and the third is the average.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


The problem involves an electron described by the state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]

where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Steps:

1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
   \[
   \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)}{1} = 2 + 5 = 7.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
   \[
   |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis:**
   To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
   \]
   where:
   \[
   c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right),
   \]
   \[
   c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:
   \[
   c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities:**
   The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are:
   \[
   P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
   \]
   \[
   P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( A \):**
   The expectation value of \( A \) is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
   \]
   Using \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \), we find:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
