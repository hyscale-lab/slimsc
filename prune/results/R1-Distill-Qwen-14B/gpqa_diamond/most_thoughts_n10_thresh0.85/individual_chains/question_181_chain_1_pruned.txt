Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction branch stops. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, because that's about the time it takes for a photon or neutrino to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the reaction stops, the effects on the neutrino flux would be observable on Earth after that time. But in this question, the change has already happened, so we need to consider the resulting flux.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux_band1 / flux_band2.

First, I need to remember what the pp-III branch does. The proton-proton chain has a few branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing two positrons and two neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are less prominent. Wait, I think the pp-III branch is when one of the protons captures a helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle), right? Or wait, maybe it's a different part. Alternatively, I recall that the pp-III branch involves reactions where a proton combines with a helium-3 ion, leading to a boron-8 isotope. Oh yeah, boron-8 is a major source of high-energy neutrinos because it decays into lithium-8 and emits neutrinos.

So the pp-III branch produces boron-8, which in turn emits neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of boron-8 would stop. Boron-8 has a half-life of about 76 million years, which is really long, but wait, does the question say the pp-III branch stopped just 8.5 minutes ago? So, the boron-8 would still be present, but no new production is happening. Hmm, but neutrinos are produced when boron-8 decays, so if we stop making new boron-8, but the existing boron-8 might still decay and produce neutrinos for a while. But the time scale here is 8.5 minutes, which is much shorter than the half-life. So the existing boron-8 would continue to produce neutrinos, but their number would slowly decrease over the next millions of years.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio now, right after the pp-III stopped. So the immediate effect would be that new boron-8 isn't being made anymore. But the existing boron-8 would still decay. So the neutrino flux from boron-8 would decrease over time, but in the immediate moment, the flux from the pp-III branch would stop, but others continue.

Wait, what are the main sources of neutrinos from the Sun? The main ones are from the proton-proton chain (pp-I), which produces low-energy neutrinos, and the boron-8 from the pp-III branch, which produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (from boron-8) will decrease over time, while the lower-energy ones (from pp-I) remain unaffected.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of two specific energy bands. Let's think about the energy distribution. Neutrinos from the pp-I branch have lower energies, while those from pp-III (boron-8) have higher energies. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So band 2 is higher energy than band 1, and perhaps boron-8 contributes more to the higher energy bands.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with lower energies, around a few hundred keV. The boron-8 decay produces higher-energy neutrinos, like around 1-10 MeV or so. Oh wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, so the bands in question are in the lower part of the boron-8 neutrinos. Or perhaps not. Wait, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay are in the MeV range. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is in the lower end. So band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) are both in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-I process have energies up to around 400 keV or so. The boron-8 decay emits neutrinos with energies up to about 15.5 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is higher than the pp-I neutrinos. So the 700-900 keV bands would be in the range where the boron-8 neutrinos are dominant, not the pp-I.

Wait, let me double-check. The main pp-I neutrinos are around 0.3-0.4 MeV, I think. Boron-8 neutrinos are much higher. So the bands in question (0.7-0.9 MeV) would be in the region where only boron-8 neutrinos contribute, because the pp-I neutrinos are lower energy. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of boron-8 (and thus these high-energy neutrinos) would stop, but the existing boron-8 would still decay, producing neutrinos for a while.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between band1 and band2. If the pp-III stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like from boron-8) stops. So, the flux in both band1 and band2 would depend on how
