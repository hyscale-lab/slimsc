Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of an operator P along some arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables like momentum are represented by operators. The operator P here is a vector operator with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, right, these look like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Their forms are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Yes, so each component of P is (ħ/2) times these. So P = (ħ/2)(σx, σy, σz) · n, where n is the direction vector.

Since the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, n must have components (nx, 0, nz). And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P along n is P = (ħ/2)(nx σx + nz σz). Because the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, no, wait. The operator is the vector dot product of P (which is (Px, Py, Pz)) with the direction vector n. So P·n = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P·n = nx Px + nz Pz.

So the operator we're interested in is (ħ/2)(nx σx + nz σz). Let me compute that matrix.

Wait, let me write each component of P:

Px = (ħ/2) σx = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) σz = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2)(nx σx + nz σz) = (ħ/2)[[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]]

Wait, let me compute that. nx σx is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]], and nz σz is [[nz,0],[0, -nz]]. So adding them:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so:

Operator P·n is (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Wait, no, that's correct. So the matrix of P·n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>

Let me write this as a matrix equation. Let the eigenvector be [a; b]. Then:

( (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Let me write these two equations:

1) nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0
2) nx a - nz b = b → nx a + (-nz - 1) b = 0

Hmm, so we have two equations:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Wait, perhaps I can write this as a homogeneous system. Since the system must have non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, I can try to find a non-trivial solution for a and b.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps using the properties of Pauli matrices would help. Because I remember that for the spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

In this case, P·n is similar to the spin operator S·n multiplied by ħ (since S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices). So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which matches the given problem.

The eigenvectors for spin-up along n are given by the spinor:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

Wait, but wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane (i.e., in the xy=0 plane, so azimuthal angle φ is 0? Or wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane implies φ=0 or π, but perhaps for a general direction, we can parameterize it differently.

Wait, perhaps n is in the x-z plane, so let's parametrize it as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle φ would usually be the angle around the y-axis. Wait, no. Wait, spherical coordinates: in standard terms, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is the angle around the z-axis. So in the x-z plane, the angle φ is either 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. So maybe φ is 0 or π, depending on the direction.

Wait, but in the problem, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So perhaps we can write n as (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ). Hmm, but since it's in the x-z plane, the point is that the direction has no y-component. So more accurately, n can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but that's only for a specific θ. Wait, no, because I can have any angle from the z-axis, so
