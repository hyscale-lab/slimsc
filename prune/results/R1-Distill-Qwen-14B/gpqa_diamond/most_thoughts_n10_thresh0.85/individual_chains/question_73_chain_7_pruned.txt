Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this step by step.

So the question is asking about the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different v_rel and E.

First, let me jot down what I know. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. So they're both moving in the same direction. So the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because we're in the realm of special relativity. Right, because at such speeds, classical velocity addition doesn't apply. I remember the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different.

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait—no, wait. Let me get that right. Because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just u - v, because of the relativity of velocity addition.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), right? Because in special relativity, you can't just subtract velocities in the same way as in classical mechanics.

Wait, so in the problem, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from A's perspective, what is the speed of B? Or wait, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the other astronaut relative to the first. Because the wording says 'relative speed and the total energy of the system.' Hmm, but wait, the system is both astronauts together, so maybe the relative velocity is between them.

Wait, but wait, no. The problem is phrased as 'the relative speed and the total energy of the system.' So perhaps each is moving, and the relative speed is between them. Oh, but the question is about the relative speed as perceived by one astronaut, I think. Or perhaps it's the speed of one relative to the other. Let me think.

Wait, but if they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.6
