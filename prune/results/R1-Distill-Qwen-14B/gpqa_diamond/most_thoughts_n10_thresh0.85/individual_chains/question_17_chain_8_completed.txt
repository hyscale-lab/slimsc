Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says.

The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion.

So, the reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Right, and K is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = K.

Wait, but the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, that would be the concentration of the complex ion. Let me denote [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M.

I need to find [Ca²+]. Let's think. In the solution, the EDTA is present as the complex, but is there any free EDTA or free calcium left? Well, since the K is really large (5e10), the reaction heavily favors the product, so most of the Ca²+ and EDTA would be tied up in the complex. But wait, we're given the concentration of the complex. So, I think we can assume that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero, and then they react to form the complex.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, when it's in solution, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, I can write the dissociation as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is for the formation of the complex, so K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. But when the complex dissociates, the K for the dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. So, K_dissociation = 1/K = 2e-11.

Wait, but for the dissociation, the reverse reaction would be the same as the formation, so the K for the dissociation (if I call it Kd) is 1/K_form.

So, [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA²-]/(K_form). Or, rearranged, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²-]/(K_form * [EDTA^4-]).

Wait, no, maybe I should model it properly. Let me let the complex be 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, some x amount dissociates, so:

[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02).

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, the expression is K_form = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Substituting, 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(10^-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So x is about 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, let me calculate that again. Let me compute x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. The dissociation is minimal due to the high K. So, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both x, as I set up earlier.

So, substituting, the calculation is right. So the [Ca²+] is x = 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start with the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium constant for the dissociation is the reciprocal of the formation constant:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of the dissociated ions \([Ca^{2+}]\) and \([EDTA^{4-}]\) both be \(x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
