Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how it affects the brightness variations observed. The scenario is that these spots make the star's light curve look similar to one with an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star.

Wait, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Right, so R_star is same as R_sun. The dark spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. Oh wait, wait, no, wait, the spots cover one hemisphere, but the filling factor is 20% over that hemisphere? Or is the total coverage 20% of the entire star? Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, I think the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the entire star's surface would have 10% coverage because one hemisphere is 50% of the surface, and 20% of that is 10% of the whole star? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the entire surface covered. Oh, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, okay, so the entire area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, no, no. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area that the spots cover. So, the star's total surface is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations.

The problem says that if we didn't have the spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we need to compute the relative change in brightness (the dip) caused by the spots and then find what planet would cause the same dip.

Wait, but when a planet transits a star, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is πR_planet² / πR_star² = (R_p/R_s)^2. So that's the fractional decrease in brightness.

But in this case, the spots are causing a similar dip. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots should be equal to the dip caused by the planet. So the dip from the spots is the same as the dip from the planet.

But wait, the star's brightness without spots is compared to a star without spots, but with a planet. So the spots cause a 20% coverage in the hemisphere, but their temperature is lower. So the total flux from the star when spots are visible will be less than when they're not.

Wait, when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. When the other side (unspotted) is facing, the flux is higher. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by the average.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the variation, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, and when it's the other side, it's higher.

So the brightness variation (ΔF) is the difference between the flux without any spots (entire star at 6000K) and the flux with spots (some spots at 5000K and the rest at 6000K).

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view. So during the rotation, part of the star's surface is covered by spots, so the total flux is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness when the spots are visible is lower than when they're not. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum (no spots visible) and minimum (all spots visible) flux.

Wait, but I think the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate into and out of view. So when the spot is on the leading limb, it's partially visible, and when it's on the opposite limb, maybe more of it is visible. Wait, but perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is facing us. Alternatively, maybe it's when the center of the spotted area is facing us. Hmm, but I think the maximum dip would be when the maximum amount of spots is visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So maybe the variation in brightness is similar to that of a planet transit. So the dip caused by the spots is similar to the dip from a planet.
