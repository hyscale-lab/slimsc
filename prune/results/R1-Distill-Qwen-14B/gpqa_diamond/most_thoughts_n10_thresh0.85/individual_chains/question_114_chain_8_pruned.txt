Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, two reactions and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically react with HCN, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo addition of CN-.

Wait, but I think for the addition of CN- to a ketone, you probably use an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon, which is activated by the acid. So the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming the tetrahedral intermediate, which then loses water to form the nitrile.

So, in the first reaction, A is the acid catalyst. Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+ (which is acidic), and option C has A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- but I'm not sure if that's the acid catalyst here.

Wait, but for the addition of HCN to ketones, H3O+ (like from H2SO4) is used as a catalyst. So maybe A is H3O+.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form amides or carboxylic acids. The conditions for this usually involve strong acid or base and heat.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis typically can be done in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you might use H2SO4 and heat, and then maybe a subsequent step to convert the amide to the acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you use something like NaOH and heat.

But looking at the reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile must have been hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's using HCl for hydrolysis.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. Hmm, but nitrile hydrolysis usually requires more than just water. Oh wait, perhaps reagent B is something that helps the hydrolysis. For example, in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So if the nitrile is treated with water and acid, it would form the carboxylic acid.

So, what's B? The options give B as either HCl, CH3COOH,
