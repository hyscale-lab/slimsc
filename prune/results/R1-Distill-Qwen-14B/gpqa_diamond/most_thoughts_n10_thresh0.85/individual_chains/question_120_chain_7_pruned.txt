Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their number density is the same throughout the space we're considering. But wait, I remember that in reality, stars aren't really uniformly distributed because galaxies are clumpy, but this is a hypothetical scenario, so I should just go with the assumption.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1, at 2 parsecs, it's 0.5, and so on.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I think I need to figure out how the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on the parallax value itself.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is constant. Number density is number per unit volume. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by that volume.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me think about the volume of space between two distance shells. The volume between distance d and d + dd would be a spherical shell. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between (r+dr)³ and r³ is approximately 3r² dr when dr is small.

So the number of stars between d and d+dd is n * 4πd² dd. But we need to express this in terms of parallax (plx). Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that.

So substituting d = 1/plx, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Oh wait, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = -1/d² dd. So dd = -d² d plx. But since plx is a positive quantity and we're dealing with small increments, maybe I can
