Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. They found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to know the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay, so luminosity of a star as a black body. I remember the luminosity formula for a black body: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same? Because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does that come into play? Oh, right, velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength might be different from the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if the stars' rest wavelengths are determined by their temperatures, but due to Doppler shift, their observed λ_max is the same.

Let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be shorter (blue shifted), and if moving away, longer (red shifted). But the question states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, for Star_1, if it's not moving (radial velocity 0), its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max must match Star_1's.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ_observed_1 = λ_observed_2.

So let's model this. Let's denote for Star_1: observed λ1 is λ_max1.

For Star_2: observed λ2 is λ_max2.

But λ1 = λ2.

But λ_observed is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter than its rest wavelength. Or if moving away, longer.

Wait, but radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. The sign might matter, but the problem doesn't specify direction, so maybe it's moving away or towards. Hmm. Let's proceed mathematically.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) 

Wait, no, wait. The Doppler effect formula depends on the relative velocity. If the star is moving towards us, v_r is positive, but the observed wavelength is shorter. The exact formula I think is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), but that's for small velocities. Alternatively, the general relativistic formula is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away).

Wait, but wait, let's be precise. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away (positive v_r) would result in redshift, so longer wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its rest λ.

But in our case, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's λ_max. But Star_1's observed λ is equal to its own rest λ because it's not moving (v_r=0). So λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. And λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is proportional to 1/T. So λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2. Since λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor, then:

b/(T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

Which simplifies to:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Star_1 has v_r1 = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 has v_r2 = 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor. Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So (b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

Canceling b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but Doppler factor depends on velocity. Let's compute the Doppler factor for Star_2.

The Doppler factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 + v / c) / (1 - v / c) ), where v is the radial velocity. Since v is 700 km/s, we need to compute this.

Wait, but v is 700 km/s. Let me compute v/c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700/(3e5) = 7e2 / 3e5 = (7/300) ≈ 0.023333.

So v/c ≈ 0.02333.

So, Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + 0.02333) / (1 - 0.02333) ) )

Compute numerator: 1.02333, denominator: 0.97667.

So (1.02333)/(0.97667) ≈ let's see, 1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ approx 1.048.

Wait, 1.02333 / 0.97667: Let me compute that.

1.02333 ÷ 0.97667 ≈ 1.048 approximately.

So sqrt(1.048) ≈ approx 1.0237.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.0237.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So T2 is about 2.37% higher than T1.

Wait, but wait. Because in the earlier step, T2 = T1 * Doppler factor. Or wait, no: from earlier, T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, let me go back. We have:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So,

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * Doppler_factor.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler_factor.

Wait, but Doppler_factor is greater than 1 if the star is moving away, because λ_obs is longer than λ_rest.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength, so λ_obs = λ_rest * Doppler factor, which is greater than 1.

In the case where v_r is positive (moving away), Doppler factor is greater than 1. So in our case, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor (which is about 1.0237 as we found). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_rest1 = λ_obs1, then:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.0237.

But λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So (b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.0237.

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.0237.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of approximately 1.0237.

So T2 ≈ 1.0237 * T1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if Star_2's temperature is higher, and it's smaller in radius, but considering the other factors, that would affect the luminosity.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, but the peak for its own emission (without considering velocity) would be at a shorter wavelength (since T is higher). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of rest wavelengths and temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it with the observed λ being the same for both.

Ok, let me think again.

For each star, the observed λ_max is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_0.

For Star_1, which is stationary, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, which is moving, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But, using Wien's law, λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So (b/T1) = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

Simplify: 1/T1 = (Doppler factor) / T2.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

So T2 is higher than T1.

Hmm. So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1.

Wait, but Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ is longer than its rest λ. Because when it's moving away, the wavelengths are stretched. So Doppler factor is about 1.0237, so λ_obs2 = 1.0237 * λ_rest2.

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_rest1 = 1.0237 * λ_rest2.

Since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T, higher λ_rest means lower temperature. So Star_1 has a lower temperature than Star_2? No, wait: λ_rest1 = 1.0237 * λ_rest2.

So λ_rest1 > λ_rest2.

Since lambda is inversely proportional to temperature, T1 = b / lambda_rest1, T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

So if lambda_rest1 is larger, T1 is smaller than T2. So T2 > T1.

So the temperatures are T2 = 1.0237 * T1.

Wait, but that would mean that Star_2 is hotter. But why? Because it's moving away, making its observed λ longer. But if the rest λ of Star_2 is shorter (because it's hotter), but when it's redshifted, the observed λ becomes longer. So to have the same observed λ as Star_1, which is not moving, the rest λ of Star_2 must be shorter, meaning higher temperature.

Wait, perhaps a numerical approach would help. Let's say Star_1's rest lambda is λ1 and T1. Star_2's rest lambda is λ2, T2.

Star_1's observed lambda is λ1.

Star_2's observed lambda is λ2 * Doppler factor. Let's call this λ2_obs.

Given λ1 = λ2_obs.

So λ1 = λ2 * Doppler factor.

But from Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So (b/T1) = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (Doppler factor) / T2.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Which is what we had earlier.

So, now, we can compute the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity L is 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 ).

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (Doppler factor) = T1 * 1.0237.

So T2 = 1.0237 T1.

So T2^4 = (1.0237)^4 T1^4.

So let's compute the ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.0237 T1)^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * (1.0237)^4 T1⁴ )

Cancel R2² and T1⁴:

= 2.25 / (1.0237)^4.

Compute denominator: 1.0237^4.

Let me compute 1.0237 squared: approx (1.0237)^2 ≈ 1.048.

Then square that: (1.048)^2 ≈ 1.098.

So denominator is about 1.098.

So 2.25 / 1.098 ≈ 2.25 / 1.098 ≈ let's calculate:

2.25 ÷ 1.098.

Well, 1.098 * 2 = 2.196. So 2.25 - 2.196 = 0.054 left.

0.054 / 1.098 ≈ 0.049.

So approximately 2.049.

Wait, that would make the ratio about 2.05.

But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler factor?

Because the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

Wait, but v is 700 km/s. Let me recompute the Doppler factor precisely.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333.

1 - v/c = 0.9976667.

So the ratio (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ≈ let's compute that.

Let me compute 1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

Approx 1.0047, because:

0.9976667 * 1.0047 ≈ 0.9976667 * 1 = 0.9976667, 0.9976667 * 0.0047 ≈ ~0.0047, so sum is 1.0023667, which is close to 1.0023333. So it's approximately 1.0047.

So sqrt(1.0047) ≈ approx 1.00235.

So Doppler factor is about 1.00235.

Wait, that's a very small factor! So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. Because when I computed v/c as 700/3e5, I get 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait: 700 divided by 300,000 is 700/300000 = 0.00233333.

Oh, I see. Earlier, I thought 700/3e5 is 0.023333, but that's wrong. It's 0.00233333.

So v/c is ~0.0023333.

So the earlier calculation of Doppler factor was wrong because I used v/c as 0.02333 instead of 0.0023333.

So let me correct that.

Compute (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) = (1 + 0.0023333) / (1 - 0.0023333) = 1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

What's that approximately?

We can write this as (1 + ε) / (1 - ε), where ε = 0.0023333.

Using the approximation for small ε: (1+ε)/(1-ε) ≈ 1 + 2ε.

So 1 + 2*0.0023333 = 1.0046666.

So (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.0046666.

So the square root of that is sqrt(1.0046666) ≈ approximately 1.00233.

Because (1.00233)^2 = approx 1.00467.

So the Doppler factor is about 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So the temperature of Star_2 is T1 * 1.00233.

So the ratio of T2 to T1 is about 1.00233.

Now, back to the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = ( R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 ).

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = 1.00233 * T1.

So T2^4 = (1.00233)^4 * T1^4.

Compute (1.00233)^4.

We can compute it step by step.

(1.00233)^2 = approx 1.00466.

Then, (1.00466)^2 ≈ 1.00934.

So approximately 1.00934.

So T2^4 ≈ 1.00934 * T1^4.

So now, L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1^4 ) / ( (1.00934) * T1^4 ) )

Which simplifies to (2.25) / (1.00934) ≈ 2.25 / 1.00934.

Compute 2.25 / 1.00934.

Hmm, 1.00934 times 2.23 is roughly 2.25 because 1.00934 * 2.23 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, let me compute 1.00934 * 2 = 2.01868, 1.00934 * 0.23 ≈ 0.23215, so total ≈ 2.01868 + 0.23215 ≈ 2.25083.

So 1.00934 * 2.23 ≈ 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.00934 ≈ 2.23.

So the ratio L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

R1=1.5 R2, so R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = T1 * 1.00233, so T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00934 T1^4.

So L1/L2 = (2.25 R2² * T1^4) / ( R2² * 1.00934 T1^4 )

= 2.25 / 1.00934 ≈ 2.23.

Yes, that's correct.

So the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.


Astronomers are comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

The luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]
Thus, the luminosity ratio is proportional to:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature via Wien's law:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]
Since the observed wavelengths for both stars are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)), and Star_1 is stationary (\(v_r = 0\)), its rest wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\)) equals its observed wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}}\)). For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)).

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]
For Star_2, the Doppler factor is:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx 1.00233
\]
Thus, the rest wavelength of Star_2 is:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs,2}}}{1.00233}
\]
Since \(\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), it follows that:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = 1.00233 \, \lambda_{\text{rest,2}}
\]
From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), so:  
\[
T_2 = 1.00233 \, T_1
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1^2 T_1^4)}{(R_2^2 T_2^4)}
\]
Given \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\), we have \(R_1^2 = 2.25 \, R_2^2\). For the temperature, \(T_2 = 1.00233 \, T_1\), so:  
\[
T_2^4 = (1.00233)^4 \, T_1^4 \approx 1.00934 \, T_1^4
\]
Substituting these values:  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25 \, T_1^4}{1.00934 \, T_1^4} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00934} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

**Answer: D**
