Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean decay distance depends on certain factors like their lifetime and speed. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

First, I think I should recall the formula for the mean decay distance. Oh right, the mean distance (L) is the product of the lifetime (τ) of the particle and its velocity (v). So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ * (1/τ), so τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure about the units here. ħ (h-bar) is in units of GeV·s, right? Or wait, let me think. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. But in particle physics, it's often expressed in terms of GeV and other units. I think ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yeah, that's right. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to match the units. Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.568. So 20.568e-25 s, which is 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Next, I need the velocity v of the meson. How do I find that? Well, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but particles decay quickly, so perhaps their velocity is near the speed of light. Let me think about the energy and momentum.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) )
