Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, and their vibrational and rotational states are quantized.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The question is asking what momentum an absorbed photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, so when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases, moving to a higher state.

The given data are the masses of the atoms, X and Y: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta in N·s.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, so the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy—so what's the next state? In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably j=0 or j=1, depending on the model). But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rigid rotor model considers rotational states as j(j+1)ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The non-rigid rotor probably allows the bond length to change a bit, but maybe for this problem, R is given as fixed. The question says "non-rigid rotor model," so perhaps the bond length isn't completely fixed.

Wait, but the problem is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the molecule being in the fundamental state (v=0, j=0) maybe? Or maybe j=1 if that's the lowest rotational state.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The fundamental state would be the lowest possible energy state, which is v=0 and j=0. Because for rotation, j can be 0,1,2,... So from j=0, the next possible rotational state is j=1. But wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state (v increases) or rotational state (j increases). The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy—so perhaps the transition is to the next allowed state, which would be either vibrational or rotational.

But which transition would have the lower energy? The vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħw, and the rotational energy levels depend on j(j+1). So the energy difference between j=0 and j=1 is ΔE_rot = [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is ħw.

Wait, so which is smaller between these two? If the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational, then the photon would need to have that energy. But I need to calculate both and see.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule can only undergo certain transitions. In the quantum mechanical model, a photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the molecule can absorb a photon to go to the next state, which could be either a higher vibrational or higher rotational state, whichever requires the least energy.

So I think I need to calculate both possible energy differences and see which is smaller, then the photon's energy will correspond to that.

But wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the one with the smallest energy increase. So we need to find the minimum energy photon that can cause a transition to a higher state.

So let's compute both possible ΔE and see which is smaller.

First, let's compute the moment of inertia I for the molecule. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced
