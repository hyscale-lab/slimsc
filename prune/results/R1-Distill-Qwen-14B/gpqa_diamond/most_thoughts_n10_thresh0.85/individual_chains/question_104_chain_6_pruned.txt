Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

So the setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, and they were detected using the RV method. 

The question is about the orbital periods. Planet #1 caused a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The star moves back and forth because of the planet's gravity. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity. So the amplitude of that shift (the velocity) relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period and other factors.

I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) which depends on the planet's mass and the system's configuration. The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ) ... Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are sun-like, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the equation simplifies.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ). But since M_p is much less than M_star, the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star) is about 1, so we can ignore that.

Wait, I think the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / c), where G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and P is the orbital period. But this looks complicated. Maybe I should find a ratio.

Since both stars have the same mass (M) and the planets have similar masses (but perhaps I can treat them as same for this ratio), the key is how K relates to orbital period P.

Wait, the formula for K is approximately K = ( ( (27 * π) / (2 * c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G * M_p)^(1/3) ) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (2π/(P )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and P. Let me try to get K in terms of P.

From the radial velocity method, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2 * π * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1, so we can ignore it. So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since both stars have the same M (M_star), and M_p is same for both planets, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me write it as K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So for Planet 1 and Planet 2:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ) ) / ( (M_p2) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ) )

But M_p1 ≈ M_p2, so M_p1/M_p2 ≈ 1.

So K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Which can be rewritten as (K1/K2) = (P
