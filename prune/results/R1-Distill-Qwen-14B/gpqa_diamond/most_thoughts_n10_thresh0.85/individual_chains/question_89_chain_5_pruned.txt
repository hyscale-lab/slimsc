Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me outline each step:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided.

2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive work-up, I think), giving product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Let me tackle each step one by one.

First, reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and given the high temperature, probably an elimination reaction is happening. Adamantane derivatives are known for their diamondoid structures. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

Elimination of HBr would likely occur, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur. Wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure, so elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So product 1 would probably be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene.

Wait, no. Let's think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule where two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When treated with KOH, each Br can leave, but since they're on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent in adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a way that each carbon is bonded to two or more others. Wait, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent positions in the adamantane framework, leading to the possibility of forming a bridge structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diene. The IR data shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, product 1's IR is at 1720, which implies a ketone or an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but if product 1 is formed by elimination, perhaps it's not a diene but something else.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides usually have a different IR region. Alternatively, maybe elimination leads to a ring-opening. Wait, perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an ether. Wait, no, more likely, elimination of HBr twice would produce an alkyne or a diene. But given the IR data, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me rethink. The IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. That suggests that elimination isn't the only reaction happening. Maybe KOH is causing some kind of substitution or rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: when dibromides react with strong bases, sometimes they undergo elimination to form alkenes, but if there's more than two substituents, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually forms aryl compounds, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide is undergoing a double E2 elimination, forming a diene. But then where is the carbonyl coming from?

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense because from a dibromide, elimination would form a double bond, not introduce ketone groups. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, looking at the H-NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about that. The singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H suggests maybe two equivalent protons adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an ether or an ester. Let me think, for example, if it's an epoxide, the protons would be around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is more like an ester's adjacent protons or an ether with some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetal structure. But let's think about the integration. 10H in a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 ppm. That's a lot of hydrogens, perhaps from a diamondoid structure, like adamantane, which is known to have several equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, but how? If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps after elimination, a ketone is formed. Wait, but elimination would typically form alkenes, not ketones. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack, but with what?

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. Let's see.

- 4.79 (2H, singlet): perhaps two equivalent protons near an oxygen, like an ether or ester.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet): maybe from the adamantane structure's bridgehead hydrogens. Adamantane has several equivalent bridgehead protons, perhaps 10 in total.
- 1.94 (2H, singlet): maybe two protons from a CH2 group connected to an oxygen.

If product 1 has a carbonyl, as indicated by IR, perhaps it's an epoxide or another structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene and then some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but KOH isn't a Grignard reagent.

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation, but without an alpha hydrogen, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but I'm not seeing it. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) are treated with strong bases like KOH, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, perhaps leading to an alkene. But wait, in that case, what would the structure look like?

But the NMR and IR don't match an alkene. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic ether. For example, if two bromines are eliminated as HBr, and the adjacent carbons form a bridge. So perhaps the product is 1,3-dioxadamac adamantane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe through oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait,
