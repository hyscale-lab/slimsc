Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that down:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution when a good leaving group is present. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition reaction?

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN⁻ ions. So perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. In the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the carbonyl oxygen (O) is replaced by OH and CN?

Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add CN⁻, maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN. But that would give (CH3)2C≡N, which is 2-cyanobutan-2-ol? Or wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. 2-hydroxy-2-methyl butanenitrile would be (CH2)2(CN)(OH)CH3? No, wait. Let me think. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Let's see the structure: the nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on the second carbon. So it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, wait: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's four carbons in a row. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile on carbon 1, hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2. So structure is CH2(CN)-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when we add CN⁻, perhaps the carbonyl becomes a nitrile, but that doesn't fit because in the product, there's both an OH and a CN group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with CN⁻ in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the protonation and loss of water, but wait, that's in the presence of H+.

So the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is HCl, or another strong acid). So when butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and H3O+ (acid), the product would be the cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So reaction A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Under what conditions does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid?

Nitrile hydrolysis can occur in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, H+/H2O would protonate the nitrile, perhaps leading to a tetrahedral intermediate, then breaking down to an amide and then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different pathway.

Wait, but in the presence of H2O and acid, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Let me think: the compound is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile group under acidic conditions, you would get a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe B is an acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but the reaction is written as B (H2O). So perhaps the reagent B is an acid, like HCl or another acid, to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So, putting it all together. The first reaction (A) is done with H3O+ (acid), and the second reaction (B) is done with HCl or another acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but for the second reaction, the reagent is H2O and B. Oh wait, the question states that the second reaction is with B (H2O). So perhaps B is an acid, like HCl, which is a catalyst in the hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: in the first reaction, acid is needed to generate the cyanohydrin. For the second reaction, perhaps a strong acid is needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

So, the first step uses A = H3O+ (so either option A or B). The second step uses B as the acid, which in the options is either HCl (A and C) or CH3COOH (B and D).

But wait, in the second reaction, H2O is the other part of the reaction. So it's a hydrolysis, which would proceed under acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be an acid.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (options A or C) or another acid like CH3COOH (options B or D).

But wait, the product in the second reaction is a carboxylic acid. For nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, the conditions are usually strong acid (like HCl) and heat, or using a peracid. Sometimes, it's done in two steps: first to amide under acidic conditions, then to acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product.

Wait, what's the typical reagents for nitrile to carboxylic acid? I think that when you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually use strong acid and heat. So HCl (concentrated) and water under reflux.

So in the second reaction, reagent B would be HCl, as the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis. So in the options, looking for B being HCl.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: B = HCl. So that's a possibility.

Option C: B = HCl, but A is NaHSO3. But for the first reaction, we needed an acid, which NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3⁻ is a weak acid, so NaHSO3 would provide H+ in solution). Wait, but wait, cyanohydrin formation is done with an acid catalyst, such as HCl, H2SO4, or H3O+. So for the first reaction, the reagent A could be H3O+ or another acid.

Wait, but the options have for A either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is typically from strong acids like HCl, H2SO4. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. Would that work for the cyanohydrin formation?

Wait, the cyanohydrin reaction requires the ketone to be in a protonated state, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So an acid catalyst is necessary. So any acid would work, but perhaps a stronger acid is better. So if reagent A is NaHSO3 (which is HSO3⁻, which is a weaker acid than H3O+), would that be sufficient?

Alternatively, perhaps in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

But wait, the second reaction is with H2O and B. So B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis. So if B is HCl, that would make sense.

So the choices would be option A or option C. Let me see the options again.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

So in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 as the acid. Would that work for the cyanohydrin?

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (HSO3⁻ is a weak acid, but in solution, it can donate a proton). So perhaps it can act as an acid catalyst.

But I'm not entirely sure. I've usually seen the cyanohydrin formation done with a strong acid like HCl. So maybe option A is the correct choice.

But let me think again about the second reaction. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have been hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So reagent B is an acid, HCl.

So if B is HCl, that would fit with option A.

Alternatively, if the second reaction uses an acid like CH3COOH, that's a weaker acid. Would that be enough for hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid? I think carboxylic acid formation from nitriles typically requires a strong acid, like HCl, possibly with heat.

So putting that together, the correct reagents would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. CH₃COOH, being a weaker acid, is less likely to facilitate this reaction efficiently.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This combination is suitable for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and may not be as effective as H₃O⁺ for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are insufficient for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct combination of reagents is **A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
