Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structures. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then connected to another cyclohexane ring, and there's a formyl (aldehyde) group somewhere. Wait, actually, the name is a bit complicated. Let me parse it: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a substituent at the 1-position. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the substituent is a methylene group (CH2-) that's attached to two things: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl ring. So, the structure is probably a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, the position is 1, which would be the same carbon as the substituent. Or maybe the structure is more like a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2- group attached, which has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl. Wait, maybe it's a branching point: the central carbon is attached to three things—two cyclohexyl groups and a hydroxyl, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group connected via a methylene group to a hydroxyl and another cyclohexane with a formyl group. I think I need to sketch this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a molecule where there's a cyclohexane ring (let's say ring A) with a CH₂ group attached. This CH₂ group has an OH and a cyclohexyl group (ring B), and the same CH₂ is also attached to another group which is a formyl (CHO) group. Wait, no, because the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring. So maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring (ring A) with a substituent: at position 1, a CH₂ group that's connected to hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl (ring B). And ring A also has a formyl group somewhere else? Or perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, let me look at the name again: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So
