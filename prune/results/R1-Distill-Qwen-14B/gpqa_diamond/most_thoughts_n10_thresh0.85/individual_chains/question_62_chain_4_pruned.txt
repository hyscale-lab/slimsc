Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the target molecule. So, the target has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a hydroxymethyl group (which is -CH(OH)-), and that's connected to another cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde) on the cyclohexane. So the structure is like cyclohexyl-C(OH)-CH2- attached to another cyclohexane with a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I should sketch it. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl (CHO) group attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So it's like CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane connected to the main cyclohexane ring.

Starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). So I need to turn this into the target.

I remember that when you have a triple bond in a cyclohexane, you can do various additions. Let's think about possible reactions.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached, which suggests some kind of hydroxylation or addition. Also, the presence of a carbonyl group (CHO) implies oxidation or some kind of ketone that is then oxidized further.

Looking at the options, each involves a series of reagents. Let me go through each option.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, maybe for elimination reactions or for alkyne reactions. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Wait, but NaNH2 and methyl chloride would typically be used for a substitution—maybe for alkylating an alkyne? Or perhaps for a Gilman reagent?

Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add hydrogen. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination or for forming epoxides, but wait, another possibility is that Ba(OH)2 in H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O—maybe it's a hydration reaction? No, wait, that combination sounds familiar. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is the Jones oxidation, which is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones.

Wait, but the target has a carbonyl group. So perhaps oxidation is involved.

But let's think about the steps. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might deprotonate the alkyne. The ethynyl group is sp-hybridized, so the acidic protons are on the triple bond. Deprotonating would give a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl methyl acetylide, which would then protonate to give CH2CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating gives the acetylide, which would react with methyl chloride to form CH2- group. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2? No, wait. Reacting the acetylide with CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? No, wait, the acetylide is a strong base. Adding CH3Cl would give CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Wait, no. The initial structure is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give cyclohexyl acetylide (the -C≡C- is deprotonated). Then methyl chloride would alkylate it. Acetylide + CH3Cl → CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? So the product after step 1 would be 1-methylcyclohexyl acetylene? Wait, but in any case, that might not be the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a Grignard-like reaction? Or maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, leading to substitution in the triple bond.

Then step 2 is H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation of the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, but wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically give an alkane. So after step 1, if we have a longer chain, like CH2CH2-cyclohexane, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted into a substituted ethyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Step 1: NaNH2 (a strong base) would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide ion. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. The acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, leading to the substitution: CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. So after step 1, we have 1-propynylcyclohexane? Or does the methyl group add to the triple bond, making it CH2-CH2-cyclohexane? No, that's not right; alkyne substitution would give a longer alkyne, not a single bond.

Wait, after step 1, the structure is CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? No, because the initial is C≡CH. Adding a methyl would make it CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Then step 2 is H2 and Pd. So hydrogenation of the triple bond would convert it into a single bond. So CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd) would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So CH3-CH2-cyclohexane. Wait, but that's ethylcyclohexane. So after step 2, we have ethylcyclohexane.

Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, maybe for forming alkenes. But the product after step 2 is ethylcyclohexane, which is a saturated compound. How would Ba(OH)2 act here? Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Wait, another possibility: Ba(OH)2 in the presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4 and H2O is a Jones oxidation condition. Wait no, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Perhaps it's used for epoxidation, but that would require an alkene.

Wait, maybe the steps are different. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)- group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol and then oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted to a ketone, then some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone. Wait, a cyclohexanone derivative. Let's think: if we have ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps first we add a group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate, then oxidize.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a ring. Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH(OH)- group. So maybe the triple bond is part of a larger ring?

Wait, maybe the first step is to create a new ring. Let's think of a possible cyclopropane formation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves adding a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the cyclohexane.

Wait, another approach. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm. So step 1 is again deprotonation and alkylation. Then step 2 is hydrogenation. Step 3 is ozonolysis, and step 4 is treatment with NH4OH.

Wait, ozonolysis is for cleaving double bonds. So if step 3 is ozonolysis, that implies that after step 2, there's a double bond. But step 2 is H2 and Pd, which adds hydrogen, so that would hydrogenate a triple bond into a single bond, not a double bond. Wait, unless step 2 is a hydrogenation that goes only part way, but I think H2 and Pd is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexane substituent and a carbonyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then some kind of oxidation.

Wait, another thought: the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a bromo group, then undergoes some kind of substitution or elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexenyl group via some reaction, then undergoes dihydroxylation or something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to analyze each option's steps.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne and then ethylate it, giving a longer alkyne. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction condition, but that's usually for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation again. Wait, I'm not sure. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But after step 2, if the alkyne was hydrogenated, perhaps it's a double bond. Wait, no, because Li in NH3 is more about reductions, like for alkynes to cis alkenes or something? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and alkylation again. But I'm getting a bit lost.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, so perhaps it would form the methyl ether? Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might deprotonate, and then the acetylide would react with methanol to form an alkyne with an OMe group. Wait, but that would be a substitution on the alkyne, giving OMe-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and could cause elimination. For example, forming an alkene. So after step 2, maybe we have cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but probably an alkene.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is often used for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. But if we have an OMe group attached to a triple bond, perhaps eliminating would give a double bond.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used for reductive workup after ozonolysis.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule yet. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group and a carbonyl group.

Perhaps another approach: the target has a carbonyl group. So maybe the oxidation of a primary alcohol would give the aldehyde. So perhaps the synthetic steps involve introducing a hydroxyl group, then oxidizing it.

So the target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexane substituent and a carbonyl group. So perhaps one part of the molecule is a cyclohexylmethyl group with an OH, and the other part is a carbonyl.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about how to introduce the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, via hydration of the alkyne. But that would give an enol, which could be oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a cyclopropane, but that's probably not the case here.

Another thought: ethynylcyclohexane could undergo a reaction to form a ketone. For example, perhaps via some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then undergoes dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol, which could then be cleaved or oxidized.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which is a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the diol is formed, then one of the OH groups is oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then some addition or reaction.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps that's formed via some kind of addition reaction to the alkyne.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then undergoes a nucleophilic addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a carbonyl group, which is then subjected to some kind of aldol addition.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option step by step.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, wait, no. Step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S and step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting the steps wrong.

Wait, in option C, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is usually followed by reductive workup, like with Zn in H2O or something. (CH3)2S is often used as a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes or ketones from ozonolysis.

So if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

Wait, but step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. H2 with Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So after step 1, which is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, we have maybe a longer alkyne. Then step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne into a single bond, making a larger alkane.

But then how do we get a double bond for ozonolysis? That doesn't make sense because step 2 would hydrogenate any double bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about step 1 in option C: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonate to form cyclohexyl acetylide, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, so the structure would become CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Then step 2 is H2 and Pd. So the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond: CH2-CH2-cyclohexane, which is ethylcyclohexane.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis. But ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis can't act on that. So that doesn't make sense. So option C might not be the right choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. What if after step 1, the structure is CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane, and step 2 is hydrogenation with Pd, which would give CH2CH2-cyclohexane. But that's saturated, so no double bonds. Ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So option C's steps don't seem to make sense.

Let me check option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So deprotonate the alkyne, then react with methanol. That would give the acetylide attacking CH3OH, resulting in OCH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base. Li in NH3 is often used for elimination reactions, like deprotonating and causing elimination. So the OCH3 group could be involved in an elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. Wait, but OCH3 is an electron-withdrawing group, maybe leading to elimination.

So after step 2, we might have a double bond adjacent to the OCH3 group, making a cyclohexene with a methoxy group.

Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of the double bond would break it into carbonyl groups. So if the double bond is between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would produce two carbonyls.

But then step 4 is NH4OH. That's a mild reducing agent, perhaps for
