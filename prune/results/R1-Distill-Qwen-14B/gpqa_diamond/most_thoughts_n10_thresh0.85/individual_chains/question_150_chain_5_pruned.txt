Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging into the formula: (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 3 degrees), an aldehyde (another one), and maybe an ether or something else, but wait, O is present. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a strong signal, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and the triplet might suggest coupling with two protons. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe triplets if coupled with adjacent protons. But in this case, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's near an adjacent CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): This seems like a pair of doublets, possibly aromatic protons. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests some electron-withdrawing groups nearby.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another pair of doublets. Perhaps another set of aromatic protons, maybe from a different benzene ring. Or maybe the same ring with different substituents.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals can be from exchangeable protons like OH groups, but in this case, maybe it's more like a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for two protons. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe an ether linkage or attached to an oxygen.

So putting this together, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings. Let me think: the 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two para-substituted phenyl groups. Then, the 3.66 ppm is a CH2 connected to something, maybe a carbonyl. The aldehyde at 9.72 would then be part of a chain connecting these aromatic rings.

Wait, the compound has C8H9NO. Let me count: two benzene rings (each C6H5), but wait, that would be C12, which is more than our formula. Hmm, maybe not two benzene rings. Oh wait, perhaps one benzene ring (C6H5), and the rest is C2H4NO, but that seems off.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think of it as C8H9NO. Let's think about the structure that would fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating for 2H. That suggests perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. Or maybe a single benzene with substituents that create two sets of doublets. But with two sets, maybe two benzene rings.

Wait, another possibility: The molecule could have a butenone structure, perhaps. Or maybe a ketone and an aldehyde.

Wait, but the aldehyde is at 9.72, which is a triplet. So maybe the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another group. For example, RCH2CHO. The triplet for
