Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity has radius r, which is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta. The options are four possible expressions for E.

Wait, right. So I'm trying to find E at a point outside the conductor. I remember that when a conductor is uncharged and there's a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, in this case, the conductor was uncharged but we added a charge +q inside the cavity. So, how does that affect the conductor?

Wait, no. Wait a second. If the conductor was initially uncharged, and then we place a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I think the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge. Because the charge +q inside the cavity would attract negative charges to the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge equal to +q, right? Because the total charge of the conductor remains zero, so inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So, the conductor's initial charge is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material's charges rearrange to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. Wait another time. The conductor was neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have a charge -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Because
