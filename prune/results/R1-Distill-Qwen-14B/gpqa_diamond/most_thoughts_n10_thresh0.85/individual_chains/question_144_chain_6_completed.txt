Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, they turn into other particles. The question provides some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all different distances, so I need to calculate the mean decay distance.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the meson. Because the distance is how far it travels before decaying, so it's velocity multiplied by lifetime. Oh right, the formula for mean path (distance) should be v times c times the lifetime. But wait, how do I find the lifetime?

I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, right? Because Γ is the energy width, and τ is the lifetime. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Oh wait, but I have to make sure the units are correct. 

So let's get the steps straight. First, calculate the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. Then, find the velocity v of the meson. Then, multiply v by the lifetime (times c to get the distance in meters). 

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? The meson is produced with energy E_X. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E_X / (m_X c²). Then, velocity v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Or maybe I can find it using the relation between energy and momentum. Oh, right, because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)² ) ) / c.

Hmm, so once I have momentum p, then v can be found as (pc²)/E. Because p = γ m v → v = (p c²) / (E). Alternatively, using p = gamma m v, and knowing that gamma is E/(m c²), so rearranging gives v = (p c²) / E.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate beta times c, which is v. So beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2). Because gamma is E/(m c²), and gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2). So rearranged, beta^2 = 1 - (m² c^4)/(E²).

Let me plug in the numbers. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. Since c² is a constant, I can compute beta squared as 1 - (1.2 / 8)^2. Let me calculate that. 1.2 divided by 8 is 0.15. Squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately… Well, since 0.985 squared is 0.9702, and 0.988 squared is about 0.9761. Wait, 0.99^2 is 0.9801. Hmm, maybe I should compute it accurately. Alternatively, I can just leave it as sqrt(0.9775) for now, but perhaps exact calculation would be better.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing the right approach. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson using beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E_X)^2).
3. Compute the mean decay distance as L = v * τ.

Wait, but actually, I think the mean decay distance is given by L = c * β * γ * ħ / (Γ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rapidity or other factors. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another formula comes to mind. The mean decay length is L = (v * c) * τ. Because τ is in seconds, and v is in meters per second, so L would be in meters.

So, let's compute each component step by step.

First, compute the lifetime τ. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (but that's in different units). Wait, perhaps using GeV and seconds, the value is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So since Γ is given in MeV, I'll need to convert that to GeV to match the units.

Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let's calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so yes, 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) × 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875 × 1e-25 s = 2.056875 × 1e-24 s.

Wait, but wait a second, no. Let me double-check the division. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 divided by 0.32. 0.32 × 20 = 6.4, so 20 is 6.4, 20.56875 would be 20 + (0.56875 × 0.32). Let me compute 0.56875 × 0.32: 0.56875 * 0.32 = 0.1819999... approximately 0.182. So 20.56875 × 0.32 = 6.582. So the division is correct.

So, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find the velocity. As I thought earlier, beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X c² / E_X )^2 ). Wait, but E_X is the energy, which is 8 GeV. m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So m_X c² is 1.2 GeV, because E=mc². So the term (m_X c² / E_X ) squared is (1.2 / 8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me approximate this. I know that sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, because 0.98^2 is 0.9604. sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. So 0.9775 is between these. Let me see, 0.99^2 is 0.9801, 0.988^2 is approximately 0.976144. Let me compute 0.9885^2: 0.9885 × 0.9885. Let's compute 0.9885 × 0.9885:

= (0.988)^2 + 2*(0.988)(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2 ≈ 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.977132. So that's close to 0.9775. Hmm, so sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let's compute it more precisely.

But maybe it's easier to just calculate it numerically. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

Compute 0.988^2 = 0.976144. The difference between 0.9775 and 0.976144 is 0.001356. So let's find x such that (0.988 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding, (0.988)^2 + 2*(0.988)*x + x² = 0.9775. We know (0.988)^2 is 0.976144, so 0.976144 + 1.976 x + x² = 0.9775. So 1.976 x ≈ 0.001356. Ignoring x² for small x.

x ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ approximately 0.000686. So, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887, so v = beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that. 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the mean decay distance L is v * τ. 

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiplying them together: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 2.056875 is 4.11375, and 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 2.000 (0.966 *2 is 1.932, 0.966*0.056875≈ 0.055). So total about 1.987. So total is 4.11375 + 1.987 ≈ 6.10075.

So 6.10075e-16 m. Wait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 meters. But wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 5.0223e-16 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my rough calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, beta squared is 1 - (m_X c² / E_X )². Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c², and m c² is the rest energy.

So yes, (m c² / E )² = (1.2 GeV) / (8 GeV) )² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let me compute it using a calculator approach.

Compute 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

= 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

= 0.9604 + 0.017088 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.977563. Close to 0.9775. So beta is about 0.9887.

So velocity is 0.9887c.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use relativistic expressions more accurately. Because L is the mean decay length, which is given by (c * tau) * beta gamma, but wait, no, because tau is already calculated based on the width, which is in the rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, right? Because the lifetime in the rest frame is tau, and the lab frame sees it as gamma tau. So the decay length is v * gamma tau.

Hmm, I think I might have messed up that part earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. So when the meson is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean decay length is v * gamma tau.

But wait, earlier I used v * tau. So that would be incorrect. I should have used gamma tau instead of tau.

Wait, that's a big mistake! So I need to correct that.

So, first, calculate tau = ħ / Γ. Then, calculate gamma = E_X / (m_X c²). Because E_X = gamma m c².

So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667.

So the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's compute that.

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 13.7125e-24 s. Wait, 6.6667 * 2.056875 is approximately 13.7125? Let me compute it:

6 * 2.056875 is 12.34125, and 0.6667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125. So total is about 13.7125. So gamma tau ≈ 13.7125e-24 s.

Then, the decay length is L = v * gamma tau.

v is 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 13.7125e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 13.7125: 3 * 13.7125 is 41.1375, subtract 0.034 *13.7125 (since 2.966 is 3 - 0.034).

0.034 *13.7125 ≈ 0.4662. So 41.1375 - 0.4662 = 40.6713.

So 40.6713e-16 meters.

So around 4.067e-15 m.

Wait, because 40.6713e-16 is 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So our calculation is about 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, why is there such a close match? Let me re-examine the steps to see if any approximation errors were made.

First, let me recalculate gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So that's correct.

Tau: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.0568e-24 s. Correct.

Gamma tau: 6.6667 * 2.0568e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s.

v = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Compute 2.9661e8 * 13.7125e-24: 2.9661 *13.7125 = ?

Let me compute this exactly.

2.9661 *13.7125:

Break it down:

13.7125 = 10 + 3 + 0.7 + 0.0125.

So:

2.9661 *10 = 29.661
2.9661 *3 = 8.8983
2.9661 *0.7 = 2.07627
2.9661 *0.0125 = 0.03707625

Adding them together:

29.661 + 8.8983 = 38.5593
38.5593 + 2.07627 = 40.63557
40.63557 + 0.03707625 ≈ 40.672646

So 40.672646e-16 m, which is 4.0672646e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m, matching option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. The slight discrepancy is due to more precise calculations of the square root and other steps.

So the correct answer is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \):**  
   The lifetime is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the formula:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic factor \( \gamma \):**  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}
   \]  
   where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Lab-frame lifetime:**  
   The lifetime observed in the lab frame is:  
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Velocity \( v \):**  
   The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relation:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X c^2}{E_X}\right)^2}
   \]  
   where \( \frac{m_X c^2}{E_X} = \frac{1.2}{8} = 0.15 \). Thus:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - (0.15)^2} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   The velocity is then:  
   \[
   v = \beta c = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

5. **Mean decay distance \( L \):**  
   The mean decay distance is:  
   \[
   L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}).
   \]  
   Performing the multiplication:  
   \[
   L = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

6. **Comparison with options:**  
   The closest match to the calculated value \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

**Answer: B**
