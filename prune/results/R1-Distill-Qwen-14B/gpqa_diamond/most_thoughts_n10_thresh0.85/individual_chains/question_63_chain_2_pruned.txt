Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can involve both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But wait, the question specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. In that model, the bond isn't perfectly rigid; it can stretch a bit, so the rotational energy levels are affected by the vibrational state.

The molecule is currently in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that's the state with the lowest vibrational energy and the lowest rotational energy. To move to the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule must absorb a photon that causes a transition to the next allowed state.

Wait, but what's the next state? The next possible state could either be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the lowest possible energy. So probably, the transition is to the next higher vibrational state, since vibrations are usually lower in energy than rotations? Or wait, no, maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the energy levels in rotation are quantized as well. For a diatomic, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. Vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) hν + hν * n, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So to go to the next lowest state, it could either increase J by one (to J=1) or increase n by one (to n=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because if the energy of the photon is lower for a rotational transition, then that would be the next state.

So I need to calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and see which one is smaller.

Let's start with the vibrational transition. The energy difference when moving from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE_vib = hν, where ν is the angular frequency given as w=4e14 rad/s. But wait, h is Planck's constant, and ν is in Hz. Oh, wait, w is given in radians per second. So ν = w/(2π). So ν = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So ΔE_vib = h * ν = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (6.366e13 Hz) ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Wait, but that's the energy. The photon's energy is this, and the momentum p is related to energy by p = E/c, since E = pc for photons. So p = 4.21e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1.403e-28 kg·m/s. Wait, but the options have N·s, which is kg·m/s, so that's correct.

Next, let's compute the rotational transition. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * [1*(1+1) - 0] = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So first, calculate μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) amu. Let's compute that: (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert this to kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that again: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = let's compute 1.8 *1.66e-27 = 2.988e-27, but more accurately 1.818 *1.6605 is around 3.017. So 3.017e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2068e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.2068e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's the energy difference for the rotational transition. So the photon's energy would be 9.21e-23 J. Then the momentum p is E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, that's way smaller than the vibrational transition. Wait, but that can't be right because 9.21e-23 J for the rotational transition is much larger than the vibrational 4.2e-20 J.

Wait wait, no, 9e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition would require a much smaller energy. But wait, that can't be because the rotational energy levels are usually closer together than vibrational. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate my numbers because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's compute ħ squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) (1e-34)^2 = 1e-68, but more accurately 1.112e-68 as before.

Then I is 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2068e-46) = (1.112 / 1.2068) )e-22 ≈ 0.921e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires 9.21e-23 J, and the vibrational is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires lower energy. But wait, no, 4.2e-20 is bigger than 9e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy, but wait, that can't be right because in molecules, vibrational transitions are higher energy than rotational.

Wait, no, no, maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1e-20 is 100 times larger than 1e-22. So 4.2e-20 J is much bigger than 9.2e-2
