Okay, so I've got this question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. So, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so they have more complicated forms.

But wait, this ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Let me write it out more explicitly. Each term is a projector, so adding them together would give a matrix, right?

I remember that any density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (r = (x, y, z)).

So to find r, I need to express ρ in terms of the identity and the Pauli matrices. Let me compute ρ. 

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. 

|0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (2,2) and 0 elsewhere. So adding them together gives a 2x2 matrix with [1 0; 0 1], which is the identity matrix I. Then dividing by 2 gives (I)/2.

So ρ = I/2. 

Now, using the general formula, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me write that out:

I/(2) = [I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ] / 2.

Multiplying both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

What are the Pauli matrices? 

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the right-hand side is a matrix. Let's compute each term:

r_x σ_x is [[0, r_x], [r_x, 0]]
r_y σ_y is [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]]
r_z σ_z is [[r_z, 0], [0, -r_z]]

Adding these together, we get the matrix:

[ [r_z, r_x - i r_y ],
  [r_x + i r_y, -r_z ] ]

But the left side is the zero matrix. So each element must be zero.

Looking at the diagonal elements: r_z must be 0, because [0,0] and [1,1] elements are zero. So r_z = 0.

Looking at the off-diagonal elements: r_x - i r_y = 0. So r_x = i r_y. But wait, r is supposed to be a real 3D vector, right? Because in the formula, r is a real vector. So if r_x and r_y are real, then r_x = i r_y would imply that r_x and r_y must be zero. Because otherwise, you can't have a real number equal to i times another real number.

So r_x must be zero, and r_y must be zero.

So all three components of r are zero. Hence, r = (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach: the density matrix ρ here is the completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the pure states are on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), and the completely mixed state is at the origin, right? Because the Bloch vector has length equal to the purity parameter. Since this is a maximally mixed state, its Bloch vector should have length zero, putting it at the origin.

So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a real vector in 3D space that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|) = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

Expanding \(\rho\) in terms of the Pauli matrices, we find:

\[
\frac{1}{2} I = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

Subtracting \(I/2\) from both sides gives:

\[
0 = r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z.
\]

This implies that the coefficients \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\) must all be zero. Thus, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the maximally mixed nature of \(\rho\).

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
