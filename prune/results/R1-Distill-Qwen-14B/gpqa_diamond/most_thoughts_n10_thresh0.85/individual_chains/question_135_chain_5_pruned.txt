Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Alright, let's break this down. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f f(y) ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Oh, maybe I should parse it better. Wait, I think it's written as -λ times f-bar times (ῡ + X) times ψ, right? Or wait, maybe the fermion fields are interacting with X. So perhaps the interaction term is something like -λ f(y) ψ_f bar (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the notation wrong, but the key point is that X is a boson that couples to fermions.

The coupling term in the Lagrangian usually tells us what particles can interact. So X couples to fermions, and since it's a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because in the interaction term, it's ψ X ψ, so the vertex would involve two fermions and the boson X. So the decay products would be a pair of fermions.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of each fermion must be less than half of X's mass, because each particle would get some energy, but the rest mass must be less than the available energy. So the condition is m_fermion * 2 < m_X. So m_fermion < 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them. Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, top quark is way heavier. Its mass is about 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV, so wait, 4.5 is more than 3, so m_X is 6 GeV. So 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. If the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV, then it can decay into that pair.

Wait, but wait, for the fermion mass m, the condition is m < m_X/2. So 6/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion lighter than 3 GeV can be produced.

So let's think about each fermion:

- Electron (e-): mass ~0.0005 GeV. Way below 3 GeV, so allowed.

- Muon (μ-): ~0.1 GeV. Also allowed.

- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV. Also allowed.

- Quarks: their masses are a bit tricky because they're confined, but in terms of decay, it's the current quark mass. The current masses are:

u: ~2 MeV (<<3 GeV)
d: ~5 MeV (<<3)
s: ~100 MeV (<<3)
c: ~1.5 GeV (1.5 < 3, so allowed)
b: ~4.5 GeV (4.5 >3 → not allowed)
t: way too heavy.

So the quarks that are allowed are u, d, s, c. Wait, but wait s is about 100 MeV, so yes, way below.

Wait, but in the options, I see options that include b, which has mass about 4.5 GeV. So 4.5 is greater than 3, so X can't decay into b b-bar because 2*4.5 GeV =9 GeV >6 GeV. So b is excluded.

So the possible ferm
