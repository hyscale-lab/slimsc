Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. Let me see what the question is asking. The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let me go through each technique one by one and see what information I can extract.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes if it's a very broad peak, it could be an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or phenol? Or perhaps something else. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, the 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation? Wait, aromatic rings have their own absorption, but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, could it be conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a conjugated ester or something else?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. That suggests maybe an alkene group in the structure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragments would give a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3O- (31), but wait, 45 is more likely something else. Maybe it's the tropylium ion? Or perhaps a ketene? Wait, another thought: The molecular ion can break into fragments. Alternatively, think about common groups. For example, a fragment of 45 could correspond to (CH2)2O, like a three-membered ether? Or maybe a CH2CH2O group? Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think of the possible fragments.

Wait, for m/z 45, maybe it's the (CH2)3O group? But that would be 45? Let's calculate. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. (CH2)3O would be (12*3 + 2*3 +16) = 36 +6 +16=58. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe a ketone group fragment. Like, the loss of a specific group. Or perhaps the fragment is CH3COO-? Let's calculate. CH3COO is 12*2 + 3*1 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59. No, that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. Or maybe the fragment is a CH2=CH-O- group? Let me calculate that. CH2=CH-O is (12*3 + 5*1 + 16) = 36 +5 +16=57. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CO2 loss or something else. Or perhaps a smaller fragment. Let's think about possible groups that have a mass of 45. Wait, 45 is equal to 12 + 24 +9? Hmm. Wait, 12*3 + 9 = 45? 3 carbons would be 36, plus 9 (maybe an O and something else). Oh wait, 12*2 + (H and O). Let me see: 2 carbons plus 3 hydrogens and an O would be 24 +3 +16=43. Close, but not 45. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 45? Let me compute: CH2CH2O is C2H4O. So molecular weight would be (12*2)+(4*1) +16=24+4+16=44. Oh, wait, that's 44. Hmm. But the peak is at 45. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH3CO group. CH3CO is 12*2 + 3 + 12 = 24 +3 +12=39. No. Wait, maybe CO plus something. Or maybe a larger fragment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone or ester group. Let me think about the molecular formula options given.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So all are six carbons. Now, let's think about each formula.

FTIR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1: likely an -OH group. So the compound has either an alcohol or another O-H group.

- Peaks at 1700 and 1650: Could be two different carbonyl groups, or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester (1700) and another is an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond (alkene) in the structure.

Mass spec: fragment at 45.

Now, looking at each option.

Option A: C6
