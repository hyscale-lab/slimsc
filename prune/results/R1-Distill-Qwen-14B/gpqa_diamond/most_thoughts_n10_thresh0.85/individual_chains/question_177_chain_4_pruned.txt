Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points given are:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
3. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That probably relates to their temperatures.
4. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, wait, radial velocity is about how fast they're moving towards or away from us. But I'm not sure how this affects luminosity yet.
5. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies.

So the options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. I think I remember that luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (which I think is the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation) are the same. The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature, as per Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9e-3 m·K). So if both have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Oh, that's an important point because if T is the same for both, then L depends only on R squared.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

So then, the luminosity L is proportional to R² * T⁴. But since T1 = T2, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that factor is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, that seems straightforward. But what about the radial velocities? The question mentions that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that factor in?

Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, wait, so the observed wavelengths are the same. So the rest wavelengths (from their own frame) would be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, but wait a minute. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is determined by Wien's law. So if their rest wavelengths are different, but the observed λ_max are the same, that would imply that their actual temperatures are different. Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the problem says: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So I think the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But the actual λ_max of the star (in their rest frame) could be different due to Doppler shifting.

So let's clarify. Let's denote λ_obs as the observed wavelength, which is the same for both stars. λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), approximately, where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer. Wait, if a star is moving towards us, v_r is negative (blueshift), and λ_obs is shorter than λ_rest. Conversely, moving away, v_r is positive, λ_obs is longer.

Wait no, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + (v_r / c)), but only when v_r is positive when moving away. So if v_r is positive, it's redshifted; negative, blueshifted.

So the problem says Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Hmm, but we don't know the direction. Wait, the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s? Or moving towards us? Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1's velocity is 0, so v1 =0. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But radial velocity can be towards or away. So let's think.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the direction, but just gives the velocities. So perhaps we can find the rest wavelengths based on the observed wavelengths.

Wait, since the observed λ_max is the same for both, let's denote λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2 = λ_obs.

But for Star_1, λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (since v1=0).

For Star_2, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2 / c), assuming v2 is the radial velocity towards us (so if v2 is positive, moving away, redshifted; if negative, moving towards, blueshifted). Wait, but the formula can be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength. The non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for towards). 

So for Star_1, λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 * (1 + 0) = λ_rest_1.

For Star_2, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + (700e3)/c ), where c is the speed of light (~3e5 km/s). Wait, 700 km/s is much less than c, so the approximation is probably okay.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which
