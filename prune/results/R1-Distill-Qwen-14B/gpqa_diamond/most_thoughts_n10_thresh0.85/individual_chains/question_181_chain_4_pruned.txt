Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, particularly the proton-proton chains. 

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the branches in the proton-proton chain, right? The main pp-I chain produces helium-4 and is the dominant process, I think. But pp-II and pp-III are alternative branches, maybe involving higher mass states or something. So if pp-III stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux reaching Earth?

Neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun, mainly the pp chains and the CNO cycle. I believe that the pp-I chain is the main contributor, but pp-II and pp-III are less significant. So if pp-III stops, only the other processes continue. But the question says all other reactions remained as they were, so maybe the dominant neutrino sources are still active.

Wait, but the neutrinos in question are probably the ones from the pp-III branch. Oh wait, no, because if the pp-III stops, then the neutrinos from that branch would stop as well. But neutrinos from other sources (like other branches or the CNO cycle) would still be present.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, which neutrinos are in which bands?

I recall that
