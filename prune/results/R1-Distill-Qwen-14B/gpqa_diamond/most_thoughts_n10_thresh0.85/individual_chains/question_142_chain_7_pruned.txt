Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the exact structure of a density matrix?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh right, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states for a qubit. I think the density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this one is different because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, right? So it's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of two pure states.

Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a single qubit state is represented as a vector in 3D space. For a pure state |θ, φ⟩, the Bloch vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But what about mixed states?

Oh, right. For a mixed state density matrix, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere is found by finding the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formula is something like r = [⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩], where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. So each component of the vector r is the expectation value of the corresponding Pauli matrix.

Let me compute each expectation value. The density matrix ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute each component:

First, the X component. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ⟨X⟩ is Tr(ρ X). Let's compute ρ X. ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Multiplying by X, which swaps |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Let me compute each term:
|0⟩⟨0| * X = |0⟩⟨0| X. X|0⟩ is |1⟩, so ⟨0| X is ⟨1|. So |0⟩⟨0| X = |0⟩⟨1|.

Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| * X = |1⟩⟨1| X. X|1⟩ is |0⟩, so ⟨1| X is ⟨0|. So |1⟩⟨1| X = |1⟩⟨0|.

So ρ X = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0|).

Taking the trace of ρ X, Tr(ρ X) = (1/2)(⟨0|⟨1| + ⟨1|⟨0|) applied to the basis. Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So when you have |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0|, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when multiplied by (1/2), the diagonal elements are 0
