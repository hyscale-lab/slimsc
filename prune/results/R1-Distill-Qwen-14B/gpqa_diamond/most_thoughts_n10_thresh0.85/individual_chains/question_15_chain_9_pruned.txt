Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, so similar sizes maybe. They were detected via the RV method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since the period is shorter.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. How does that affect things?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but wait, actually, the formula for the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since Earth-like planets have much smaller radii than stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability simplifies to approximately (R_star) / (a_planet) multiplied by some constants, but wait, no, the actual probability (the geometric probability) is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since R_planet << R_star, it's roughly (R_star / a_planet). But wait, no, that's not right. The transit probability is actually (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet * (1 + m_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) ), but maybe that's for another consideration. Wait, no, maybe the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some factor.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis. So P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. Another thought: the formula for the transit probability is (R_star / (a_planet)) multiplied by (1 + R_planet / R_star). So P ≈ (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet.

But in any case, both planets have the same masses, but the stars have different masses but same radii. So maybe the probability depends on the star's radius and the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, but the planets' orbital periods are different, so their semi-major axes are different. Since the period is three times shorter for Planet_1, according to Kepler's third law, (a^3)/(M_star) = (G M_star) (P/(2π))^2 → a^3 = G M_star (P/(2π))^2 * something. Wait, more accurately, Kepler's third law is a^3 = (G(M_star + m_planet) * P^2)/(4π²). Since m_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can ignore it. So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(
