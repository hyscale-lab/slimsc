Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, actually, plx (parallax) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to find N as a function of r, where r is the distance.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ d^5. Wait, no. Let me calculate that correctly. If plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that can't be right because higher d would mean more stars. But wait, actually, when you look farther, you should see more stars if they are spread out in space. Wait, but that depends on the distribution.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by considering the volume. Oh! Wait a second—number density of stars might depend on the volume, which depends on the cube of the radius. But the problem is about the number of stars in a region, which probably depends on the volume. Hmm, but in this question, it's given that N varies with 1/plx^5, so I can't mix in the volume approach yet.

Let me think again about the relationship given. The problem states that N ∝ 1/plx^5. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. Therefore, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that would mean that as d increases, N increases rapidly. But that doesn't make sense because the number of stars should depend on the volume, which is d^3. Are we missing something here?

Wait
