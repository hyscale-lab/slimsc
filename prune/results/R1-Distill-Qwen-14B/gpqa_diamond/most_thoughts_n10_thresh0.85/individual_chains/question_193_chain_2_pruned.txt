Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. Hmm, wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Wait, let me get that straight. Parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if distance r increases, parallax decreases. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = k/r, where k is a constant. Or more accurately, plx = 1/(r parsecs), so plx in arcseconds is 1 over the parsec distance.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/r, because plx = 1/r. So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/(1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm. So per unit increase in r, how does N change?

Wait no, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, maybe I should think about the number of stars as a function of distance. Or perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the number of stars in a unit volume. But wait, the region of the sky is fixed, but varying distance. Hmm, perhaps it's about the volume and how stars are distributed.

Wait, the number of stars detected in a certain direction (so a certain part of the sky) would depend on how many are within a certain distance range. So if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5
