Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius, but it has spots covering one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler or hotter? Well, the temperature difference is 1000 K. I guess spots are usually cooler, so maybe they're 5000 K? But wait, the problem says "temperature difference," so I need to clarify. Oh, wait, it says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is either 5000 K (if 6000K is the star's Teff) or 7000 K. Hmm, probably cooler spots, so 5000 K. But I should keep that in mind.

The setup is that when one hemisphere has these spots, as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. But the question is about how this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So when we observe the star's light, it looks like there's a planet causing the dimming, but actually, it's just the spots.

The problem asks: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

So, the idea is that the dip in brightness when a planet transits the star is similar in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots. Wait, but in this case, the star isnâ€™t spotted entirely, just one hemisphere. So when it rotates, the spotted side comes into view, causing a dip, and then goes away. But the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the observed brightness variation is similar to a planet transit.

But wait, the question is about what's the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do. So I need to calculate the maximum dip in brightness due to the spots and compare it to the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, the question says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So in reality, the star has spots, but the question is about a hypothetical planet producing the same amplitude. So we need to find
