Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options for the chemical formula are four different possibilities.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR are often due to O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might indicate hydrogen bonding, which is stronger in things like -OH groups. So maybe it's an alcohol or a phenol, but phenols have even broader and maybe different regions? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group with something else. Hmm.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those look like carbonyl (C=O) stretches. But wait, 1700 is typical for maybe ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group, perhaps a conjugated one, or maybe an amide, but wait, amides have lower wavenumbers because of the resonance. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone? So if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two different C=O groups? Or maybe one peak is a different environment. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and another is an ester, or maybe something else.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, typically in the range of 4.5-7 ppm as doublets or something like that. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond somewhere in the molecule, maybe an alkene.

And then the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 is a common mass; for example, the tropylium ion in aromatic compounds is m/z 91, but wait, that's higher. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a methyl group attached to something. Wait, wait. 45 is the mass of CH3O as a fragment? Or maybe the acylium ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO+? Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a molecular ion at m/z 58. Hmm. Maybe a methylene group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group in a particular environment. Or perhaps it's a fragment from a larger molecule breaking down, like losing a part of it.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all of these have 6 carbons, but varying hydrogens and oxygens.

Let me think about how each functional group would fit.

The IR: broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H. So if the molecule has an -OH group, then: the formula would have at least one O. Looking at options, all have O except maybe option B, but B is C6H10O. Wait, yes, all have O. So that's not the differentiator.

The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1: two carbonyl groups? So perhaps the molecule has two C=O groups, like in a ketone and an ester, or maybe two ester groups, or maybe a ketone and a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, if the formula has two oxygen atoms, like option A (O2) and C (O2), that could accommodate two carbonyl groups. Option B is O, so only one O. Similarly, D is O, so also one O. So if two carbonyls are present, the formula must have two O's. So that would eliminate options B and D, leaving A and C.

So between A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

Now, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the molecule must have a double bond. So the formula should have enough hydrogens to account for that.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each formula.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero.

So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1.

But we have a double bond (which is one DoU) and maybe an O-containing group. So perhaps a ring? Or another double bond.

Wait, the IR suggests two carbonyl groups (two double bonds). So two DoUs. So if the formula has two DoU, let's see:

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 4/2=2. So 2 degrees, which could be two double bonds (like two carbonyls) or one double bond and a ring, etc. So that's possible.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (14-12)/2=1. So only one degree of unsaturation. But we have two carbonyl groups, which would require two DoU. So this doesn't add up. So option A is probably not correct.

Wait, but that would mean that option C is the correct one because it has two DoU, allowing for two double bonds (the two C=O groups and the vinyl group). Or, wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond) is one DoU. If there are two C=O groups, that's two more DoU, but that would require three DoU, which would be impossible. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if the molecule has a double bond (1 DoU) and two carbonyl groups (each a DoU), that's three DoU. But the formula for option C has two DoU. That can't add up.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute DoU for each option again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU.

So the molecule must have two DoU. So perhaps two double bonds or one double bond and one ring, or one triple bond, etc.

But in the problem, we have a vinyl group (a double bond) and two carbonyl groups (each a double bond), which is three DoU. That would need the formula to have three DoU. But option C only has two. So this is conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Or perhaps the two carbonyl peaks are not two separate groups but something else.

Wait, another thing: the two IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be from the same carbonyl group in different environments. Wait, but 1700 is usually for ketones or aldehydes, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated ester or a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an amide, but amide peaks are lower than 1650.

Wait, perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring C=C stretching. Oh wait, no. The aromatic C=C stretch is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1, but if it's conjugated with a carbonyl, it could be higher. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated C=C (like in an enone system), and the 1700 is a ketone.

But then the O-H peak is at 3000, broad. So the molecule has an -OH group, possibly a ketone, and an enone double bond.

Wait, but the formula would need to account for all of that.

Another approach: looking at the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. What could that be? Let's think about possible ions.

45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (but that's 58, no). Or maybe CH3CHO (which is acetaldehyde, molecular ion at 44, but 45 could be a fragment). Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group, but that's formaldehyde which is 30. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CH2
