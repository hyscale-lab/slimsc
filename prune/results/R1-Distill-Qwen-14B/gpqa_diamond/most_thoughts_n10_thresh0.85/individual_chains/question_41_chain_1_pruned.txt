Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things can get a bit tricky because of relativity, but I'm not too sure. Let's break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I think this involves how the speed of light is perceived when the medium (glass) is moving. I remember that in a medium, light's speed is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

Oh right, in classical mechanics, velocities add up. So if the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at (c/n) relative to the glass, then the lab frame would see the light speed as (c/n) + v. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, but wait a second. No, that's not right. Because when you're in a moving medium, the light's speed isn't simply additive like that. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't specify that the speed is relativistic. Oh, the speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1. Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming classical approach?

Wait, no, I think the problem is more about the medium moving, so it's about how the index of refraction affects the velocity as seen from the lab. Another thought: when the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So perhaps we have to consider the relative motion.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving at v relative to the lab. So using the velocity addition formula from relativity might be needed. Oh wait, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, velocity addition in special relativity is when you have two frames moving relative to each other, and you want to find the velocity of an object in one frame as seen from another. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and the frames are moving at velocity v. So in this case, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So u would be c/n, and the lab frame would see u' = (c/n + v)/(1 + (v*c)/(n c²)) ). Simplify that.

Wait, c is 1, so u = 1/n. So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v*(1/n) ) ). Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify. So numerator becomes 1 + n v, denominator becomes n + v. So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that's one of the options. Let's check the options. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1. So according to this, the answer would be A.

But wait, another thought: the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same
