Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. Right, Einstein's equations.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction, the positive x-axis. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me start with the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c squared)). Oh wait no, wait. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when both are moving in the same direction. So in this case, the two velocities are v1=0.6c and v2=0.5c.

Plugging those in: numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c.

Now, looking at the options, let's see. Option C says 0.14c. Option D also says 0.14c. So I'll have to look at the energy part to decide between them.

Next, the total energy. In relativity, the total energy of an object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and sum them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says E=4.96. So the correct energy would match option C, which also has the correct relative speed of 0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any mistakes. For the relative speed, I think I did that right. The formula gives 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's correct. For the energies: 2.5 plus about 3.464 is indeed around 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we use principles of special relativity. The two astronauts have masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) and travel at relativistic speeds \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\), respectively, in the same direction. We calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]
Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

1. For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

2. For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
