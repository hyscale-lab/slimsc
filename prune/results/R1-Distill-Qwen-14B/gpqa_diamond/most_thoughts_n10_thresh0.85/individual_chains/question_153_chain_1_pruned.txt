Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants. I need to figure out the products for each and match them to the options provided.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, and in basic conditions, it can form an enolate. Wait, NaOEt is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating the malonate to form the enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. So the structure is more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to the double bond, and the E configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, that would be the alpha position of the acrylate's carbonyl. Wait, no, the Michael donor is the enolate, and the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a good donor) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate (which is the Michael acceptor). The reaction is a conjugate addition, adding the nucleophile to the beta position.

So dimethyl malonate has two methyl ester groups and a central carbonyl. When it forms the enolate, the negative charge is on the central carbon. The attack occurs on the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the acrylate is CH2=CH(CO-OCH3)(p-tolyl), but I'm probably getting the substituents wrong. Let me structure it correctly. The structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the COOCH3 on carbon 2 and p-tolyl on carbon 1. Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-(CO-OCH3) with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(p-t
