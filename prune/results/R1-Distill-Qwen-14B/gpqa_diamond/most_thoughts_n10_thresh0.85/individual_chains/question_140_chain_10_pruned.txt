Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused because it's pretty detailed. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, I think I should start by figuring out what each of these substances could be. Let's take it one piece at a time.

First, the reaction of X with Y gives gas W. W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, the molecular weight of W would be the sum of protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait—each atom's protons and neutrons add up to the mass number. If each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Or perhaps the molecule itself has equal protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, no. Because the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, in H2O, each molecule has 10 neutrons (since O has 8 and H has 1 each; 8+2=10 neutrons?) Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of possible gases.

Wait, another approach: what gases are produced when metals react with liquids like acids? Oh, maybe gas W is hydrogen (H2) or another gas like CO2 or SO2, but those have more complex structures. Wait, but if W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, let me think about possible molecules.

Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since hydrogen is usually protium, with one proton and no neutrons). So each H2 molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons—no, that doesn't match because 2 protons and 0 neutrons are not equal. So H2 wouldn't work.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the isotope ¹²C, which is the most common). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (¹⁶O). So CO2 has one C and two O. Let's see: C contributes 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Each O contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 6 + 2×8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2×8=22. Oh! So CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is O2. O2 has each O with 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons. But each O has 8 neutrons (¹⁶O), so each O has 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So O2 is another possibility. But I'm not sure which one is more likely.

Alternatively, maybe H2O. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So for H2O: 2×1 (H) + 8 = 10 protons; 2×0 (H) +8 = 8 neutrons. Oh, that's not equal, so that's not a match.

Wait, maybe another gas. What about CH4? Wait, but that's more of a hydrocarbon. When would a metal react with an acid to produce CH4? Not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, another angle: the reaction is violent. So maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But earlier I thought H2 wouldn't fit because the protons and neutrons don't match. Oh wait, but if Y is a liquid acid, like sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, maybe X is a metal. Then the reaction would produce H2.

Wait, but wait: if W is H2, then each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So 2 protons and 0 neutrons: not equal. That doesn't fit. So maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, let's consider another possibility. Maybe W is NH3? No, because that's a gas, but when would a reaction produce NH3? Not sure.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. Let me think again. If the reaction produces CO2, what would be the possible substances X and Y? X is a metal, perhaps, reacting with Y, which could be a carbonate solution. No, because carbonate reacting with a metal would produce CO2? Or maybe Y is a strong acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. Wait, no, because water is a liquid, but reacting with a metal would produce H2.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (0°C), but that's not matching. Alternatively, some other substance.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like sodium carbonate decahydrate? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is higher, around 800°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think about when a precipitate is formed and then heated to release B. If G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. For example, if G is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), heating it would produce Na2O and CO2. But Na2O is a solid, but I'm not sure about the melting point. Alternatively, if G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of Na2CO3 is about 854°C, which is way higher than 277 K (~4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another approach: the precipitate G could be a hydroxide. For example, if Y is a base, and X is a metal, then maybe a metal hydroxide precipitates. But when heated, metal hydroxides decompose. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 would produce MgO and water. But the melting point of MgO is very high, around 2800°C. Not matching.

Wait, maybe B is a metal oxide that has a low melting point. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let me think about another angle.

The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, what's a keto acid? Keto acids are organic acids with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or others. When they react with X, which could be a strong base, perhaps?

Wait, another thing: the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier, implying that X is a compound where one element has a heavier isotope. For example, if X is NaOH, then the Na could be the heavier isotope, like ²³Na instead of ²¹Na.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. If X is a base, like sodium hydroxide, and Y is an acid, like sulfuric acid. Then, the reaction would produce salt, water, and perhaps gas. Wait, but earlier I thought about CO2, but let's see.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, Y is water. If X is a metal that reacts violently with water, like potassium or sodium. The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. Let's think about that.

So, for X as sodium (Na), Y as water (H2O). The reaction would produce NaOH, H2, and heat. The precipitate G could be NaOH, but that's a solution, not a precipitate. Alternatively, if Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then X (like Na metal) would react to produce Na2
