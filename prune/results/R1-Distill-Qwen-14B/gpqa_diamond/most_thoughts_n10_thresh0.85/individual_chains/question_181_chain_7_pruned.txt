Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping suddenly. Hmm. Let me try to think through this.

So, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux1 over flux2.

Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The pp chain is a major one, right? And the pp-III branch is part of that. The pp chain produces protons, and then eventually leads to helium via the CNO cycle, I think.

Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The main ones are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I and pp-II branches, and the heavier elements contribute via the CNO cycle. Oh wait, the question specifies that the pp-III branch stops. So what's the pp-III branch?

From what I recall, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain where three protons combine in a different way. Wait, maybe it's when two protons combine with a helium-3 ion. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then there's a branch where a proton captures a deuterium nucleus, which is the pp-II branch. Then, the pp-III is another branch? Or maybe it's a high-mass branch in certain conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

But the main point is that the pp-III branch is a source of neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos. So if this branch stops, then the number of neutrinos produced in that process would suddenly drop. But wait, how does this affect the overall neutrino flux reaching Earth?

Neutrinos are produced through several processes in the core of the Sun. The main neutrinos come from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, I think. Because the CNO cycle occurs in hotter and denser regions of the Sun's core, which have higher temperatures.

So the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. The pp chain's neutrinos are in the lower keV range, while the CNO neutrinos are higher, like in the hundreds of keV. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me think: the standard solar neutrinos from the pp chain are around tens to hundreds of keV
