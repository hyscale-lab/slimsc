Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving a pair of pH values.

First, let's recap what I remember about titrations. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point is where moles of base equal moles of acid. 

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to find both values.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentrations after dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) and concentration 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we titrate, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So the titration reaction would be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, for the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added should equal moles of acetic acid.

But the question is about 25% titration. So first, find how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume?

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Let me calculate how much acetic acid is neutralized. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. Since it's a 1:1 reaction, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH are neutralized, forming CH3COO^-.

So initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 (from earlier)
Moles reacted: 0.00025
So remaining CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles
Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025

The total volume at this point is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is closer to 2, so maybe around 4.73 or 4.74?)

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa = 4.733 (approximately 4.73).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, so around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73.

Wait, but wait, did I compute the ratio correctly?

Wait, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425 L) / (0.00075 / 0.0425 L) → because the volumes are same, it's (0.00025/0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

So the log is log(1/3) = log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253, which is approximately 4.25, so option A has 4.26, so that's close. But let's check the other parts.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The sodium acetate will dissociate completely, and the acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

Let me find the concentration of acetate ions.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been converted to acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (equivalence point volume) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is a weak base. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Since Kb is small, we can approximate the hydrolysis as negligible and use the formula for pH:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, so:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ Kb → since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate denominator as 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Wait, because log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= -5 +0.017 = -4.983 → so pOH≈4.98.

Then pH = 14 - pOH → 14-4.98 =9.02.

Wait, but that's a pH of about 9.02. But none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → let me compute that precisely.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So Kb is correct. Then, concentration is 0.02 M.

So x² = Kb * C → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let's compute that.

Log(1e-5)= -5. Log(1.04)≈0.017. So log(1.04e-5) = -5 + 0.017 = -4.983 → so pOH=4.983.

pH = 14 -4.983 =9.017, approximately 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH of around 9 at equivalence. Looking at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → So equivalence pH is 8.52, which is less than 9. So that's not matching.

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 → 6.92, which is also not close.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the way I calculated the equivalence point is wrong.

Wait another approach: when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution is basic.

But wait, wait, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is as before, 5.405e-10.

But the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.02 M (since 0.001 moles in 0.05 L).

So, using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)*0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH=9.02. That's what I get.

But none of the options have a pH around 9.02 for the equivalence point. Let me double-check my initial setup.

Wait, maybe I messed up the moles. Let's check that.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 moles. So yes, exactly neutralizes the acetic acid. So the acetate concentration is indeed 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Hmm. So why are the options not matching? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26 (close to my 4.25) and 8.52 → which is lower than my 9.02.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → 6.92 is acidic, which can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think differently. Maybe I should calculate it using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The pH can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → but at equivalence, [HA] is zero? No, wait, at equivalence, HA is all converted to A^-. So that's not applicable.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10. The pH can be found using the formula for a weak base:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C) → but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no, that's not the exact formula. The exact formula for weak bases is:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ) → but only if the approximation holds (i.e., Kb * C is small, and x is much smaller than C).

So in this case, Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11, which is really small. So the approximation holds.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial moles or concentrations.

Wait, let's re-examine the initial steps.

We diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So new volume is 40 cm³, correct.

Concentration after dilution: (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, we added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

So, moles of acetate: 0.001, volume 0.05 L → 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you add NaOH, it's a strong base, so you neutralize all the acetic acid, right? But wait, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so solution is basic. So the pH should be around 9. However, the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial moles. Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L. Concentration 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001. Correct.

At equivalence, added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH → 0.001 moles. Correct.

So, acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. So why is the equivalence point pH not matching any options? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → let me compute this accurately.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So 0.267 + (-5) → -4.733 → pKa=4.733.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at 25% titration. Let me double-check that.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Correct.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 -0.00025= 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] ) → 4.73 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → 4.73 + log(0.333). Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So 4.73 -0.477 =4.253 → about 4.25.

Which is close to option A's first value of 4.26.

But wait, in the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. That 6.92 is lower than 7, so it's acidic, which can't be right at equivalence.

So, looking at the options, only option A and D have the 25% titration pH in the right ballpark.

But the equivalence point pH is 9.02, which isn't in any option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I messed up the initial dilution.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M.

No, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point's solution. Let me think again about the equivalence point.

Wait, when we reach the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.02 M acetate ion in water.

Which is a buffer solution? No, it's a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it's a basic solution.

But wait, perhaps the student (me) made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73.

Kb = Kw / Ka → (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the solution is not just the acetate ion but also the sodium ion, which is a spectator ion. So, no, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] =5.405e-10.

Let me let x be [OH^-].

So, [CH3COOH]=x, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²= 0.02 *5.405e-10=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, same as before.

But none of the options have pH around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point's moles.

Wait, maybe I got the moles of acetic acid wrong.

Wait, initial moles: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 moles. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001, so yes, all acetic acid is neutralized. Correct.

So the acetate is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L → 0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the pH at the equivalence point, and the options have a different value. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → 8.52 is less than 9.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → 6.92 is acidic.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using pKa for the 25% point but maybe I should be using something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial pH calculation for 25% titration.

Wait, another approach: the 25% titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001.

Moles neutralized at 25%: 0.00025.

So moles left: 0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

In 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075/0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.73 + log(0.005882/0.017647).

The ratio is (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) → (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So log(1/3)= -0.477.

pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253, approximately 4.25.

Which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

But in that case, the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is way off from my calculation of 9.02.

So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should use the exact calculation without the approximation.

Wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

So the equation is:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But if I don't approximate, then:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b + sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute that:

5.405e-10^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → 29.214 *1e-20 → 2.9214e-19.

4ac =4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → Wait, no, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4*(1)(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, wait. The quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0.

In this case, it's x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.9214e-19, so D≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)≈sqrt(4.324e-11) → approx 6.58e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.58e-6 ] / (2*1) → approx (6.58e-6)/2 → 3.29e-6.

Wait, that's much bigger than the previous x of 1.04e-5. Hmm, that can't be right. Because 3.29e-6 would give a higher pH.

Wait, but that might be a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, 5.405e-10 is 0.0000000005405. So when computing the discriminant, 4ac is 4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. So, in the discriminant: D = b^2 -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (5.405e-10)^2 +4.324e-11.

Wait, (5.405e-10)^2 is 2.9214e-19, which is negligible compared to 4.324e-11. So D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=6.58e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.58e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.58e-6)/2 → 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6)=5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Wait, that's matching option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, so why did I get a different result before when I used the approximation?

Ah! I see the confusion. I think I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me re-derive.

Wait, the correct equation is:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x)

Which is x² + Kb x - Kb*0.02 =0.

So a=1, b= Kb=5.405e-10, c= - Kb*0.02 = - (5.405e-10)(0.02) = -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (2.9214e-19) + (4.324e-11) → which is approximately 4.324e-11 + negligible → sqrt(D)≈6.58e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.58e-6 ] / 2 → (6.58e-6 - 0.0000005405) /2 → approximately 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So I made a mistake earlier by taking Kb into account correctly in the quadratic equation, which gives a pH of about 8.52 at equivalence. That matches option A's second value.

So, putting it all together: 25% titration pH is approx 4.25, and equivalence point pH is approx 8.52. So option A says 4.26 and 8.52, which matches.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. The steps are as follows:

### 1. **Initial Setup and Dilution**
- The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:
  \[
  \text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### 2. **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]
This neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:
\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]
The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]
The total volume at this point is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\), we calculate:
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### 3. **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid are neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The total volume is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of acetate is:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]
Acetate acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the approximation for weak bases:
\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]
and the pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]
However, none of the options match this value directly. Using a more precise calculation (quadratic equation), the pH at the equivalence point is found to be approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

### 4. **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match option A.
