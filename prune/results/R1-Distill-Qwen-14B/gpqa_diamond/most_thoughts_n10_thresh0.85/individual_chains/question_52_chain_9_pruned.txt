Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots is making the star cooler overall. 

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, I'm looking for (Ratio_without_spots) / (Ratio_with_spots) = ?

They also mention that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. Oh, wait, that's in the near ultraviolet range. I remember that transitions in atoms are influenced by temperature, so this must relate to the Boltzmann equation.

In local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio is n1/n2. Oh wait, the question says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. So, without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots. So the factor is greater than 1.

The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2 exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2 exp(-ΔE/(k T_spots)) ) ].

Wait, actually, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher), so (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio decrease. That matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, T is higher, so the ratio is higher.

So, the ratio without spots is higher, so the factor is more than 1.

Let me compute the factor. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2 exp(ΔE/(k T_no)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2 exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out. So the factor becomes exp(ΔE/(k T_no) ) / exp(ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) ) ).

But wait, calculating ΔE from the wavelength might be tricky. Alternatively, since the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength λ = 1448 Å, the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ.

But wait, let's think: h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So ΔE = hc/(λ). Let me compute that.

But wait, maybe I don't need to compute the actual energy. The ratio involves the exponential of (ΔE)/(k T), and the difference in T. Maybe I can find the ratio using the temperatures.

Let me denote T_no = 6000 K, T_spots = 5500 K.

So, the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) ) ).

Wait, no, because the exponent in the
