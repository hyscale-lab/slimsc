Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, especially when adding or finding relative speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, actually, I'm a little confused. Let me get this right. If I have two objects moving at v1 and v2 in the same direction, the relative speed between them (from the perspective of the first one) should be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) or maybe (v1 - v2)? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula for adding velocities is (u' - v)/(1 - (u'v)/(c²)), but here, perhaps one is observing the other's speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds divided by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, let me get the formula correct. The relative speed formula when two objects are moving in the same direction is: (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, if object A is moving at u relative to the rest frame, and object B is moving at v in the same direction as A in the rest frame, then from A's perspective, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Oh, wait, no, I think I have it backwards. If A is moving at u in the lab frame, and B is moving at v (which is larger than u) in the lab frame, then from A's perspective, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)) or something like that. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, no, the correct relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of an object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (like the astronaut's own speed). So if the lab frame is the first astronaut's frame, then the second astronaut's velocity relative to the first would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. If astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame (say, the Earth frame), and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's frame, what is astronaut 2's speed? So from 1's perspective, 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). That's (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) → (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. But speed is a magnitude, so the relative speed is 0.1428c or about 0.14c. That would be one of the options. Looking back at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

So now, the relative speed is either 0.14c or 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c, so I think option C or D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c squared. So I need to compute gamma for each and sum them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut 1, v = 0.6c. Let's compute gamma1: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Mass is 2m, so energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 has v = 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So gamma2 is approximately 1.1547.

His mass is 3m, so E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c² and the relative speed is 0.14c. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. I thought that from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.1
