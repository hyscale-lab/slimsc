Hmm, okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure this out. The question is about the stability of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. I remember that stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So the setup: we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I thought the stability constants increase with the number of ligands attached. Let me think... Oh, right, each βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is the complex with one SCN-, β2 with two, and so on.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? So it's the species with n=2.

I remember that to find the distribution of species, we use the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex relative to the total. The fractions depend on the log of the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

Let me think about the formula. The fraction of the Co(SCN)_n complex is given by (βn * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum over m=1 to 4 of βm * [SCN]^m). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So the total concentration of all cobalt species is [Co(total)] = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

But wait, the [Co] is the free Co^2+ concentration, but in the solution, the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. Oh wait, no, the total cobalt is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion. So the total c(Co) is the sum of [Co], [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

Wait, but how do we model this? I think we model it using the formation constants. Let me denote the species as Co, CoSCN, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. The formation of each complex is stepwise, so the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise constants from β1 to βn.

Wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait, the way stability constants work is that βn is the overall constant for the formation of the nth complex from the (n-1)th. Or is it the overall constant from the metal and n ligands? Hmm, I think in this case, each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 = [CoSCN]/[Co][SCN], β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/[Co][SCN]^2, etc.

But I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. Oh, right, I think that's the case. So β1 is the constant for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but in the problem, the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is first ligand, β2 is second, etc. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2 is β1*β2, for Co(SCN)_3 it's β1*β2*β3, and so on.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. Stability constants are usually the overall constants, not the stepwise. But I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, stability constants are usually for the overall reaction, like Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2−n, and the β is the equilibrium constant for that reaction. So each βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

Wait, but that can't be because when you have multiple complexes, the overall βn isn't the product of previous βs. Alternatively, perhaps each βn is the stepwise constant. So perhaps for the first complex, β1=9, for the second, β2=40, meaning the second ligand binds with a higher stability than the first? But that doesn't make sense because the second ligand usually binds less strongly.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let me try to write the formation reactions.

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; β1 = 9.

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2 ; β2 =40. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40= 360.

Similarly, Co(SCN)_2 + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_3 : β3=63, so overall for Co(SCN)_3 is 9*40*63= 22680.

And for Co(SCN)_3 + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_4 : β4=16, so overall K for Co(SCN)_4 is 9*40*63*16= 380160.

Wait, but the problem gives the β1 to β4 as 9,40,63,16. So each step adds another ligand with a certain β. So the fraction of each complex depends on these stepwise βs and the ligand concentration.

But wait, the problem is to find the percentage of dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes. So I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] relative to all species.

The general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex, which is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, the denominator is the sum of all possible species, including the free metal ion and all complexes.

Alternatively, the fractions can be found using the expression:

For each complex n, the fraction fn is ( [Co] * [SCN]^n * βn ) / D, where D is the denominator as above.

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction for each species is calculated as follows.

The free Co^2+ is [Co].

The CoSCN^+ is [Co][SCN]β1.

The Co(SCN)_2 is [Co][SCN]^2 β1β2.

And so on.

So the total concentration is:

Total [Co] = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

Which can be written as:

Total [Co] = [Co] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

So,

[Co] = [Co]_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but given that [Co] is the free ion, and the total is [Co]_total.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all species.

Wait, let me define:

Let’s denote the free Co^2+ concentration as [Co], and the others as [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

So,

[Co]_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

But each complex can be expressed in terms of [Co] and [SCN].

So,

[CoSCN] = β1 [Co][SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1β2 [Co][SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β1β2β3 [Co][SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β1β2β3β4 [Co][SCN]^4

Thus,

[Co]_total = [Co] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

We can solve for [Co]:

[Co] = [Co]_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

But the problem gives us both [Co] and [SCN]. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but I think that's the initial concentrations before complexation. Alternatively, perhaps [SCN-] is 0.1 M, and [Co] is 1e-2 M, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think the total concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- is 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are [Co^2+] = 1e-2 M, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But the actual concentrations of the species will change due to complexation.

But perhaps, given the problem statement, we can assume that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. But wait, when the complexes form, the free [SCN^-] may decrease. But the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so perhaps we can assume that the concentration is fixed, maybe because SCN- is in excess. Hmm, but that depends on the context. Alternatively, it's given as the initial concentration, but we have to account for the complexes formed.

Wait, this might complicate things. But the given problem states that the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So perhaps, for the purposes of this calculation, we can treat [SCN^-] as 0.1 M because it's given and perhaps assuming it doesn't change much upon complexation. Because if the solution is at equilibrium, the [SCN^-] would change, but maybe the approximation holds that it's effectively 0.1 M.

So, going back, the fractions. The fraction of each species is (β1β2…βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all terms (including 1 for [Co]).

But wait, the fraction for Co(SCN)_2 is (β1 * β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

Denominator D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

So, let's compute each term.

Given:
β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term in D:

Term0: 1

Term1: β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β1 * β2 [SCN]^2 = 9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term3: β1*β2*β3 [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4 [SCN]^4 =9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4=1e-4=0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So, D = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Then, the fraction for n=2 is (Term2) / D =3.6/64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the fraction for Co(SCN)_2 is Term2 / D, which is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556, or 5.556%.

Wait, but that's about 5.55%, which is not one of the options. The closest options are D) 16.9% and C)38.1%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the way the fractions are calculated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the βn are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise. Oh! Maybe each βn is the overall K for the nth complex. That would change things.

If each βn is the overall stability constant, then:

For Co(SCN)_n^2−n, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n).

In that case, the fractions would be (βn [SCN]^n) / sum over m=0 to 4 of (βm [SCN]^m) + 1.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because for each complex, the term would be βn [SCN]^n, and the sum would include β0=1 for [Co].

So the denominator D is sum for m=0 to 4 of (βm [SCN]^m), where β0 is 1 (for the free ion).

So, that would mean:

D = β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but in this case, β0 is 1, as the free ion. So,

D =1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the βn are the overall constants. Let me think about the correct approach.

If each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, then:

For n=0: [Co] = [Co]

n=1: [CoSCN] = β1 [Co][SCN]

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co] [SCN]^2

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if you have β1 as the overall for n=1, and β2 as the overall for n=2, then the fraction for n=2 would be (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me recalculate with that.

Given that the βs are the overall constants, not the stepwise.

So,

D =1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So,

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term0:1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now sum them up.

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So D≈2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is term2, which is 0.4, divided by D.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So according to this calculation, it's about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I need to be careful. Earlier, I thought the βs were stepwise, which gave a much lower percentage. But if the βs are overall, then the answer is option D.

Another way to think about this: if each βn is the overall stability constant, then the fraction calculation is as above.

But how do I know whether the βs are stepwise or overall?

The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants are typically the overall constants, not the stepwise. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex from the metal and n ligands.

So, in that case, the calculation with D=2.3646 and fraction=0.
