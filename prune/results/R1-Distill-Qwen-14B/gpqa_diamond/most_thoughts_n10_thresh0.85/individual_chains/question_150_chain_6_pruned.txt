Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it undergoes reactions with three reagents: NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should probably figure out what the starting compound looks like based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. In proton NMR, aldehydic protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. A triplet might indicate some coupling. So maybe an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests maybe adjacent to another aromatic proton. So perhaps para-substituted benzene rings?

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another aromatic doublet. This might be part of a different aromatic ring or perhaps the same ring if there are substituents.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad signals can indicate exchange with something else, like -OH groups. But wait, in the starting compound, maybe these are from some protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, like an aldehyde. Or perhaps they're the protons on a ring adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol group. But wait, the molecular formula has an O, but no OH yet, unless it's part of a ring.

Wait the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring (maybe another benzene, but that would be six, but then maybe a double bond and some rings).

Wait wait, let me think again. Benzene is 4 degrees (3 from the ring, 1 from the double bonds). Wait, no, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds, but that's equivalent to three degrees, while a ring is one. So benzene is four degrees: 3 for the three double bonds and one for the ring? Wait no, wait, each ring is a degree, each double bond or triple bond is a degree as well. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees, plus the ring (which is one degree). So total four degrees.

But wait, each ring or double bond contributes one. So for benzene, which is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, that's 4 degrees (ring counts as one, each double bond as one, but wait, no: each double bond is one, but the ring is also one. So three double bonds (3) plus ring (1) makes four, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each double bond is one degree, each ring is one. So benzene is a ring (1) plus three double bonds (3), making four degrees. So if the molecule has a benzene ring, that's four, and perhaps another double bond and another ring or something else. But let's see.

Wait the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. But maybe the NMR can help more.

Looking at the NMR again:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. Probably an aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? Maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Because if the aldehyde is at the end of a chain, maybe it's coupling with
