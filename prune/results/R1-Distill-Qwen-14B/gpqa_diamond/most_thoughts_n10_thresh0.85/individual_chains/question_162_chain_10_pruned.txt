Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of x and y. I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it looks like a two-dimensional spacetime.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—oh right, that's like a hyperbolic surface. But wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. But I'm not entirely sure about the terminology here; sometimes people refer to spheres in different spaces.

Wait, the options given include 4π(x² + y²) and others, so maybe the area is a function of x and y. But wait, no, the area should be a number, unless it's parameterized. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The general form for a 2D metric is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So here, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). The area in differential geometry is calculated using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dA, but wait, in 2D, the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait no, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy, but since this is a diagonal metric, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. So for ds² = E dx² + G dy², the determinant is EG - 0 (since off-diagonal terms are zero here). So det g = (32/(4 -x² -y²))²? Wait no, E and G are the coefficients, so E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant is E*G = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, but wait, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²), right? Because sqrt[(32/(4 - ... ))^2] is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the
