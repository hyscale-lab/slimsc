Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given Ca-EDTA complex. Let me see.

So the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, first, I should remember what a stoichiometric complex is. I think it means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. So when they say 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that would be 0.02 M of the complex as a whole.

EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is usually written as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA. So in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y⁴− ions. But wait, the formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex.

The formation constant (K) is given by K = [Ca²+][Y⁴−] / [CaY²−]. Since K is 5x10^10, that's a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low because almost all of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Similarly, the concentration of free Y⁴− would also be x because each CaY²− dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y⁴−. Wait, is that right? Because when CaY²− dissociates, I get Ca²+ and Y⁴−. So for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole each of Ca²+ and Y⁴−. So yes, [Ca²+] = [Y⁴−] = x.

So plugging into the K expression: K = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5x10^10.

But wait, since K is so large, the dissociation of the complex should be very small. So x would be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That's an approximation we can make.

So the equation simplifies to x² / 0.02 = 5e10. Solving for x²: x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is the square root of 1e9, which is 3.16e4? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if x is 3e4, that's way larger than 0.02 M, which would break our initial assumption.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The K expression is [Ca²+][Y⁴−] / [CaY²−]. But wait, the complex is CaY²−, which comes from Ca²+ and Y⁴−. So when the complex dissociates, you get Ca²+ and Y⁴−. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y⁴− ↔ CaY²−, and K is 5e10.

Wait, but wait, the K is given as Kf, the formation constant. So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]).

Wait, that's another way of writing it. So Kf is 5e10. So, (CaY²−) = 0.02 M (since that's the complex concentration), and [Ca²+] = x, [Y⁴−] = x.

So Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) = 5e10.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when the complex dissociates, the product is the concentrations of the ions. So Kf is:

Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]).

So substituting, Kf = 0.02 / (x²) = 5e10.

So then, x² = 0.02 / (5e10).

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 2e-6 squared is 4e-12. Hmm, wait, 4e-13 is 0.4e-12, so sqrt(0.4e-12) is sqrt(0.4) * 1e-6. Sqrt(0.4) is around 0.632, so x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. So Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is stable, so x should be very small. So
