Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and B when G is heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what these substances could be. Let's think about the reaction first. X reacts violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently with substances? Maybe something like water? Or perhaps an acid or a base. Wait, the product includes a gas W with same number of protons and neutrons. What gas fits that?

Protons and neutrons in a molecule? Oh, wait, W is a molecule, so each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think. If each molecule has, say, 2 protons and 2 neutrons, that would be a molecule of He (helium), but that's a noble gas and doesn't form molecules. Alternatively, maybe something like H2O, but no, that's not same protons and neutrons. Wait, wait. Let me think of possible molecules.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, each atom contributes. Wait, maybe the molecule is something like O2? No, O has 8 protons, each O atom has 8 neutrons in the most common isotope. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (since 2 atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So the total would be 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, that would mean the molecule has 32 protons and 32 neutrons? No, the molecule as a whole. Wait, maybe each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So, for example, a molecule of CO2? No, that's 1 C and 2 O's. Let me calculate:

Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (in C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have 6 + (2*8) = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 + (2*8) = 22. Oh wait, so CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That could be W.

But wait, CO2 is a gas. So in that case, Y might be something that reacts with X to produce CO2. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Let me think. Another possibility is CH4. CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4*(1 H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6, each H is 0, so 6. So 10 protons vs 6 neutronsâ€”no, not equal. So that's not it.

Hmm, what about H2O
