Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the problem is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges, especially with electric potential energy, the key formula involves the coulomb constant and the product of charges divided by distance.

Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details. So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e? So that's twice the elementary charge, right? Each charge is 2e. And their mass is negligible, so we don't have to worry about kinetic energy; the problem is purely about potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Oh, so the setup is that one charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I guess point P is where the 13th charge is located.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. So we're looking for the potential energy of this configuration. Since it's an isolated system, I think that means we're considering the potential energy as stored in the system's configuration.

I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, for multiple charges, how does that work? Oh right, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, in this case, the setup is such that each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from point P, where the 13th charge is located.

Wait, no. Because the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge at P. So we have 12 charges each interacting with the charge at P. But also, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters apart from P, but what about their mutual interactions? Do I need to consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges?

Ah, that's an important point. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. But the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they all at the same point? Probably not, because if they were, they'd all be on top of each other, but that's probably not the case. So perhaps they form a spherical shell around P, each at a radius of 2 m. But their exact arrangement isn't specified, which complicates things. Because the potential energy between them depends on their distances.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So to minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes repulsion, but in this scenario, their positions are constrained. Hmm, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which suggests that their exact positions relative to each other are fixed, so perhaps we can treat them as a fixed arrangement. But I'm a bit confused because the problem doesn't specify whether they are placed symmetrically or not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The 12 charges are each at 2 m from P, so each of them is at a distance of 2 m from the central charge. So each of these 12 charges will contribute a potential energy term with the central charge.

But wait, the 12 charges are identical and have the same charge, so each of them will contribute the same amount to the potential energy. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy between them and the central charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So each pair contributes that.

But wait, wait, wait. The central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is 2e as well. So each pair (central and a surrounding charge) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So that's U = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

But wait, that's for each charge. Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, that's only part of the story. Because the 12 surrounding charges, each being 2e, are all interacting with each other. So their mutual interactions would contribute additional potential energy. But the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So perhaps their arrangement is such that they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but without knowing the exact distances between them, it's impossible to calculate their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. Hmm, but I don't know their exact positions. Alternatively, maybe the mutual interactions are not considered because they are constrained in a way that their positions are fixed, and hence their mutual distances don't change. Or perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so the total energy would be the sum of all pairwise potentials. So perhaps I'm missing some terms. Let me think again.

The total potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So for each pair of charges, calculate the potential energy and sum them all.

In this case, the system consists of a central charge (let's call it charge A) and 12 surrounding charges (B1, B2, ..., B12). So the potential energy would come from:

1. The potential between A and each Bi. There are 12 such pairs, each contributing U_AB = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) because each Bi is 2m away from A.

So that's 12 * U_AB.

2. The potential between each pair of Bi and Bj, where i ≠ j. There are C(12,2) = 66 such pairs. Each pair's potential is U_BiBj = k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between Bi and Bj.

But wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. That means each Bi is at a distance of 2 m from P, but it doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So without knowing the exact arrangement, we can't compute all the r_ij terms. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are as large as possible, thus minimizing the repulsion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding charges, and not the mutual potential between the surrounding charges. That would make the calculation easier, but I'm not sure. The question says it's the minimum energy of the system. 

Wait, but I think it's more accurate to include all the potential energies, including the mutual ones. So perhaps I'm missing that part.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that they form a uniform distribution on a sphere of radius 2 m. If they're uniformly distributed, then the average distance between any two charges can be estimated. But I'm not sure about the exact formula for that.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying it and only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges, ignoring the mutual energies. Let me think why that might be the case. Because the problem states it's an isolated system, so all the potential energies must be considered. But perhaps in this setup, the mutual potential energy is negligible or can be ignored for some reason.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the charges. Each of the 12 surrounding charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. So each pair contributes U_AB = k*(2e)^2 / (2) = k*4e²/(2) = 2 k e². Multiply that by 12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, the mutual potential energy among the 12 surrounding charges is the sum of all U_ij for i < j. Each U_ij is k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij. But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute this exactly. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So if we arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, the mutual potential energy would be minimized. Because if they are as far apart as possible, each U_ij would be as small as possible, thus minimizing the sum.

But arranging 12 charges as far apart as possible on a sphere—what would that look like? Probably a regular icosahedron or something, but the exact distances vary. However, without specific distances, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual interactions are zero, which is unlikely. Or, perhaps the mutual interactions are ignored because the problem is only considering the potential due to the central charge. But that seems incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the numbers are in the order of 10^-26 J, which is a very small number. Let me compute the value for the first part (only the central charge and the 12 surrounding) and see which option it matches.

So, let's compute 24 k e².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

k * e² is 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let me calculate that.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e-29.

8.988 * 2.566 is approximately 23. (Because 8 * 2.5 is 20, 0.988 * 2.5 is about 2.47, so total ~22.47.)

So 22.47e-29 J. Multiply by 24: 22.47 * 24 = 540 approx. So 540e-29 J = 5.4e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a higher value. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, so this approach gives me a value of about 5.4e-27 J, but none of the options exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the mutual potential energy as well. Let me think about that.

If the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P but equally spaced on a sphere, what's the average distance between two charges?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the mutual potential energy as if the charges are uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere of radius r=2 m. Then, the average potential energy between any two charges can be estimated.

Wait, the average distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is given by (3r)/π. So for r=2 m, average distance is (3*2)/π ≈6/(3.1416)≈1.9099 m.

But wait, I might be misremembering. Let me think: the average chord length between two random points on a sphere of radius R is (3R)/π. So yes, that's correct.

So the average distance r_avg ≈ (3 * 2 m) / π ≈ 6/(3.1416) ≈ 1.9099 m.

So each mutual pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / (1.9099 m).

So U_ij = k *4e² / (1.9099 m).

So, for each of the 66 pairs (since C(12,2)=66), the total mutual potential energy is 66 * [k*4e²/(1.9099 * 2)].

Wait, no, the denominator is 1.9099 meters, not 2 meters. Because the mutual distance is about 1.91 m on average, not 2 m.

So, U_mutual = 66 * [k*(4e²)/(1.9099)].

So let me compute that.

First, compute 4e²: 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 = 8.988 *1.0264 = approx 9.23, so 9.23e-28 J.

Then divide by 1.9099: 9.23e-28 / 1.9099 ≈ 4.83e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 4.83e-28 *66 ≈ 3.20e-26 J.

So the mutual potential energy contributes approximately 3.20e-26 J.

The previous part, the potential between each Bi and the central charge A, was 24 k e². Let me re-calculate that more accurately.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e=1.602e-19 C

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So each pair (A and Bi) contributes U_AB = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2 * (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e-29.

8.988 *2.566≈23.07.

Multiply by 2: 46.14.

So 46.14e-29 J = 4.614e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 * 4.614e-28 =55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27 J.

So the potential energy from A and the 12 Bi is about 5.5368e-27 J.

The mutual potential energy is about 3.20e-26 J.

Wait, that's an order of magnitude higher than the first term. So the total potential energy is approximately 3.2e-26 +5.5e-27 = about 3.75e-26 J.

But looking at the answer options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but not exact. Hmm. But maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is not as large as I thought. Because in reality, when the charges are on a sphere, the potential energy between any two charges isn't the same as if they were just at a fixed average distance. Because each pair contributes (k q^2)/r_ij, and the sum over all pairs is the total mutual energy.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell of charges. I'm not sure. Let me think.

The potential energy of a spherical shell with charge Q is (3/5)(k Q²)/(R), where R is the radius of the shell. Wait, is that correct? I think that's the formula for the self-capacitance or something else, but maybe for a uniformly charged spherical shell, the potential energy is (3/5)(k Q²)/(R).

Wait, let me think again. The potential energy stored in a spherical shell of radius R with charge Q is U = (3/5) (k Q²)/R. So yes, perhaps we can use that.

In our case, the 12 charges are each 2e, so the total charge on the shell is 12 * 2e =24e.

But wait, the shell's charge would be the sum of all the Bi charges. So Q=12 * 2e =24e.

So the potential energy of the shell is U_shell = (3/5) * k * (24e)^2 / (2 m).

Because the radius R is 2 m, as each Bi is 2 m from P.

So, let's compute that.

(24e)^2 = 576 e².

So U_shell = (3/5) * k * 576 e²/(2).

So U_shell = (3/5) * (8.988e9) * 576 e² / 2.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So 576 e² =576 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 1.483e-35 C².

Then, (3/5) * k = (3/5) *8.988e9 ≈ 5.393e9.

Multiply by 1.483e-35: 5.393e9 * 1.483e-35 ≈ 8.005e-26.

Now, divide by 2 (the radius R is 2 m): 8.005e-26 / 2 ≈4.0025e-26 J.

So the shell's potential energy is about 4.0025e-26 J.

Wait, but that's just the shell's self-energy. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the energy between the central charge and the shell, plus the shell's own potential energy.

Wait, the central charge is 2e, and the shell has a total charge of 24e. The potential energy between the central charge and the shell would be the product of the central charge and the potential at the center due to the shell.

Wait, no. The potential at a point inside a spherical shell is the same as on the surface. So the potential at P due to the shell is V_shell = (k * Q_shell) / R.

So V_shell = k * (24e) / (2 m) = (8.988e9) * (24 * 1.602e-19 C) / 2.

Compute that:

24 *1.602e-19 =38.448e-19 C.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 38.448e-19 = (8.988 *38.448) e-10.

8.988 *38.448 ≈ 346. So 346e-10 V = 3.46e-8 V.

Divide by 2: 3.46e-8 /2 =1.73e-8 V.

The potential at P is 1.73e-8 V.

The charge at P is 2e. So the potential energy U is charge * potential: (2e) * V.

So U = 2e * 1.73e-8 V.

But 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So 3.204e-19 C * 1.73e-8 V =5.54e-27 J.

Wait, so the potential energy between the central charge and the shell is about 5.54e-27 J.

Then, the shell's own potential energy is about 4.0025e-26 J, as computed earlier.

So the total potential energy is the sum of these two: 5.54e-27 +4.0025e-26 ≈4.5569e-26 J.

Looking back at the answer options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

So 4.5569e-26 isn't directly an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the shell's potential energy calculation. Let me recheck that.

The formula for the potential energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell is U = (3/5)(k Q^2)/(R). So in this case, Q is 24e, R=2 m.

So U_shell = (3/5) * k * (24e)^2 / 2.

Compute (24e)^2: (24)^2=576, e^2= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So 576 * 2.566e-38 =1.483e-35 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *1.483e-35 = 1.333e-25.

Multiply by 3/5: 1.333e-25 * 0.6 =8.0e-26.

Divide by R=2: 8.0e-26 /2=4.0e-26 J.

So yes, the shell's potential energy is 4.0e-26 J.

The potential energy between the central charge and the shell is 5.54e-27 J.

So total U ≈4.0e-26 +5.54e-27 ≈4.55e-26 J.

But none of the options are exactly this. So perhaps the problem is considering only the potential between the central charge and the shell, omitting the shell's self-energy.

In that case, the potential energy would be 5.54e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The total potential energy includes all pairwise interactions. That is, each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge, and each pair of the 12 charges interacts with each other.

So, U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

We calculated U_central as 5.5368e-27 J.

Hmm, earlier I thought U_central was about 5.5e-27, but in the shell approach, it's 5.5e-27.

But what about U_mutual? If the mutual potential energy is (3/5)(k Q^2)/(R), which is 4.0e-26 J, then U_total is 4.55e-26 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are considered to be in a different way. Wait, another way to think about mutual potential energy is that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with all other 11 charges.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible. But the problem says it's an isolated system, so perhaps it's considering all interactions. But perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not their mutual interactions.

In that case, the potential energy would just be U_central, which is about 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option B is 2.822e-26 J.

Hmm. Wait, 5.5e-27 J is approximately 0.55e-26 J, which is half of option B (2.822e-26). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated U_central as 5.54e-27 J, that's with the shell's potential. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute U_central as the sum of all individual interactions between the central charge and each of the 12 charges.

Each interaction is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So each of the 12 charges contributes 2 k e².

So total U_central = 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Compute this accurately:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e=1.602e-19 C

e²=2.566e-38 C².

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ≈2.299e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24*2.299e-28 ≈5.517e-27 J.

So U_central =5.517e-27 J.

Now, what about the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges on the shell?

Each pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute each term. However, perhaps the problem ignores the mutual interactions, considering only the central charge's contribution. In that case, the total energy would be approximately 5.517e-27 J.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 25% higher. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each charge on the shell interacts with the central charge, but the mutual interactions between the shell charges are neglected. So the total energy is 5.517e-27 J, which is approximately 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is exactly 5 times 5.645e-26. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute U_central.

Each charge on the shell is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. The distance is 2 m.

So each pair contributes U = (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e)/(2).

So U per pair = 8.988e9 *4e²/(2) =8.988e9 *2e².

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So U per pair =8.988e9 * 2 * 2.566e-38 =8.988e9 *5.132e-38.

Multiply 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = 4.598e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.598e-28 *12 =5.518e-27 J.

So that's the same as before.

But looking again, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger than our result. Hmm. Is there a possibility that the problem is considering each charge on the shell being 2e, but the central charge is also 2e, leading to 13 charges in total, but the potential energy is calculated differently?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the central charge with each of the 12, and each of the 12 with each other. But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are 2 meters as well. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question expects.

If that's the case, each mutual pair would contribute U_ij = k*(2e)^2/(2).

So for each of the 66 mutual pairs, U_ij = (8.988e9)*(4e²)/(2) = same as each central pair, 4.598e-28 J per pair.

So 66 pairs contribute 66 *4.598e-28 ≈3.032e-26 J.

Add that to the central contribution of 5.518e-27 J: total U ≈3.032e-26 +5.518e-27 ≈3.58e-26 J.

Still doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are all at 2 meters. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters apart from each other as well as from the central charge. But that's not possible unless all 12 charges are at the same point, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges, and not the mutual ones. So the total energy is U_central =5.517e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but that's about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the U_central calculation. Let me recalculate.

Each Bi is at 2 m from P. The central charge is 2e. Each Bi is 2e.

So U for each pair is (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m).

Which is 8.988e9 *4e²/(2) =8.988e9 *2e².

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e squared is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So 2e² = 5.132e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = (8.988 *5.132) *1e-29.

8.988 *5.132 = approx 45.98.

So 45.98e-29 =4.598e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.598e-28 *12=5.518e-27 J.

So that's correct. So where is the option that matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option B)2.822e-26 is about 5 times larger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each 2e, and the central charge is 2e as well. So the system is 13 charges. But the problem says 13 identical particles, each 2e. Wait, wait, the problem states: 13 identical particles each with charge 2e. 12 are constrained, 1 is fixed.

Oh, wait a second! I think I made a mistake. The 13th charge is fixed at P, which is 2e. The other 12 are each 2e, constrained at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central is 2e. So each pair (central and a Bi) is 2e *2e. That's correct.

But wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/4πε0 in the formula? No, because Coulomb's law in vacuum already includes that.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2 meters, which I used correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which could be the potential energy when the system is in equilibrium. But in that case, perhaps the mutual repulsion would arrange the 12 charges in a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but arranging the 12 charges to minimize mutual repulsion would require them to be as spread out as possible, which would minimize the mutual potential energy. But without knowing the exact distances, it's impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero if the charges are arranged symmetrically, but that's not correct because like charges repel.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not their mutual interactions. That would make the answer approximately 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Looking back, the options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, 5.5e-27 J is 0.55e-26 J. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately 7e-27 J. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges, which is (1/2) * sum over all pairs (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

So the sum includes each pair once.

In this case, the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So the central charge interacts with each of the 12, contributing 12 terms.

The 12 charges interact with each other, contributing C(12,2)=66 terms.

So the total potential energy is:

U = (1/2) * [ 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2)) + 66 * (k*(2e)^2/(r_ij)) ) ].

But again, without knowing r_ij, I can't compute the second part. But perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are 2 meters as well. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question expects.

In that case, each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2/(2 m)).

So U = (1/2) * [12 * (k*4e²/(2)) + 66*(k*4e²/(2)) ].

That is, U = (1/2)* [ (12 +66) * (k*4e²/(2)) ) ].

So (12+66)=78.

U = (1/2)*78 * (k*4e²/(2)).

Simplify:

78/2 =39.

4e²/(2)=2e².

So U =39 * k *2e².

So U=39 *8.988e9 * 2*(1.602e-19)^2.

Compute step by step:

2e² =2*(1.602e-19)^2=2*(2.566e-38) =5.132e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 39 *8.988e9 =3.505e11.

3.505e11 *5.132e-38 = (3.505 *5.132) e-27.

3.505 *5.132 ≈18.00.

So U=18.00e-27 J =1.8e-26 J.

But this isn't matching any option either.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are being considered with each pair at 2 meters. So each of the 66 mutual pairs contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as the central interactions.

So the total U is:

(1/2) * [12 * (8.988e9 *4e²/(2)) + 66 * (8.988e9 *4e²/(2)) ) ].

Which is same as (1/2) * (78) * (8.988e9 *4e²/(2)).

Which is same as 39 * 8.988e9 * 2e².

Which is same as 39 *8.988e9 *5.132e-38.

Wait, no, wait: 8.988e9 *4e²/(2) =8.988e9 * 2e² =8.988e9 *2*(1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 =4.598e-28 J per pair.

So for 78 pairs (12+66), U = (78 *4.598e-28) * (1/2) [because we're considering each pair once]. Wait, in the formula, it's (1/2)*sum over all pairs, but in my initial approach, I have to use (1/2) to avoid double-counting.

Wait, no. The formula U=(1/2) sum over all pairs. So each pair is considered once.

So for 12 pairs between central and surrounding, and 66 mutual pairs, the total sum is 78 pairs.

So U = (1/2) *78 *4.598e-28.

78 *4.598e-28 = 3.598e-26.

Multiply by 1/2:1.799e-26 J.

Ah, so approximately 1.8e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Each central pair: 12 pairs.

Each mutual pair:66 pairs.

Each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) = (8.988e9 *4e²)/(2).

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 =4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*(2.566e-38)=1.026e-37 C².

So each pair contributes U = 8.988e9 *1.026e-37 /2.

Which is (8.988e9 *1.026e-37) /2.

8.988e9 *1.026e-37 =9.22e-28.

Divide by 2:4.61e-28 J per pair.

Now, total number of pairs:

12 (central and surrounding) +66 (mutual) =78.

So U=78 *4.61e-28 /2.

Because each pair is counted once, the formula is U=(1/2)*sum, so:

U= (78 *4.61e-28 ) * (1/2) =39 *4.61e-28 ≈1.798e-26 J.

So approximately 1.8e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option B is2.822e-26, which is about 50% higher. So perhaps the problem is considering a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is a point charge located at 2 m from P, but not necessarily on a spherical surface. For example, they could be arranged in a straight line, all at 2 m from P but along different directions. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I'm using the incorrect formula for the potential energy. Because when you fix the position of charges, the potential energy is indeed the sum of all pairs. But another approach is to consider the potential energy as the work done to assemble the system. So the central charge is fixed first. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought into place. The energy required for each would be the potential at P due to the central charge plus the potential due to all the previously placed charges.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think about that.

The first charge (B1) is brought to 2 m from P. The potential at P due to the central charge (2e) is V_central = k*(2e)/(2) = (8.988e9 * 2e) / 2.

Wait, no: V = k q / r. So V_central = (8.988e9 * 2e)/2.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C.

So V_central = (8.988e9 * 3.204e-19)/2.

Compute numerator:8.988e9 *3.204e-19 = 2.878e-9.

Divide by 2:1.439e-9 V.

So bringing B1 to P would require work W = q * V = (2e) * (1.439e-9 V).

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So W =3.204e-19 *1.439e-9 =4.616e-28 J.

Then, bringing in B2. Now, the potential at P is due to the central charge (2e) and B1 (2e).

So V = V_central + V_B1.

V_central is same as before: (8.988e9 *2e)/2 =1.439e-9 V.

V_B1 is the potential due to B1 at P: same calculation, but since B1 is at 2 m from P, the potential at P due to B1 is also (8.988e9 *2e)/2 =1.439e-9 V.

So total V at P when placing B2 is 1.439e-9 +1.439e-9 =2.878e-9 V.

The work to bring B2 is W =2e *2.878e-9 =3.204e-19 C *2.878e-9 V=9.216e-28 J.

Similarly, bringing in B3 would require calculating the potential due to the central charge and the two already placed charges.

Wait, but this approach would be time-consuming for 12 charges. Let me see if there's a pattern.

The first charge: W1=4.616e-28 J.

Second charge: W2=9.216e-28 J.

Third charge: The potential at P is V_central + V_B1 + V_B2.

Each B charge contributes 1.439e-9 V at P.

So for the third charge, V_total =1.439e-9 *3.

So W3=2e * (3 *1.439e-9) ) =3.204e-19 *4.317e-9 =1.385e-27 J.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each new charge adds 1.439e-9 V to the potential.

So, for the nth charge, the potential at P is (n * 1.439e-9 V).

Wait, no, because the first charge adds 1.439e-9, the second adds another, etc. So for the k-th charge (k from 1 to12), the work done is Wk=2e * (k *1.439e-9).

Summing all Wk from k=1 to12:

Total work U = sum_{k=1 to12} [ 2e * (k *1.439e-9) ].

Factor out constants: 2e *1.439e-9 * sum(k=1 to12 k).

Sum(k=1 to12)= (12)(13)/2=78.

So U = (3.204e-19 C) * (1.439e-9 V) *78.

Wait, 3.204e-19 *1.439e-9=4.616e-28.

4.616e-28 *78=3.599e-26 J.

So about 3.6e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is2.822e-26, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute each step accurately.

Compute each Wk:

Wk =2e * (k * V_p).

V_p = (k_central + (k-1)*V_Bi).

Wait, no, when placing the k-th Bi, the potential at P is due to the central charge (2e) and the (k-1) Bi's already placed.

So V_p = (k_central) + sum_{i=1 to k-1} V_i.

Where k_central = (8.988e9)(2e)/(2) )= (8.988e9)(3.204e-19)/2.

Compute that:

8.988e9 *3.204e-19 =2.878e-9.

Divide by 2:1.439e-9 V.

Each Bi contributes 1.439e-9 V at P when placed.

So for placing the k-th Bi (from 1 to12), the potential at P is:

V_p =1.439e-9 + (k-1)*1.439e-9.

So for k=1: V_p=1.439e-9.

k=2: V_p=1.439e-9 *2.

k=3: V_p=1.439e-9 *3.

So on, up to k=12: V_p=1.439e-9 *12.

So the work for each k is Wk=2e * V_p.

Thus, Wk=2e *1.439e-9 *k.

Summing from k=1 to12:

U = sum_{k=1}^{12} [2e *1.439e-9 *k ].

Factor out constants:2e *1.439e-9 * sum_{k=1}^{12}k.

sum k=1 to12 is 78.

So U=3.204e-19 *1.439e-9 *78.

Compute 3.204e-19 *1.439e-9 =4.616e-28.

Multiply by78:4.616e-28 *78=3.598e-26 J.

So U≈3.6e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:2.822e-26, but it's about 28% less than our calculation.

Hmm. This is confusing. So I'm not sure which approach is correct. The problem is about an isolated system, so perhaps the correct approach is to sum all pairwise interactions, but without knowing the mutual distances, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the central charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual ones. In that case, the energy is about 5.5e-27 J, but that's not among the options. The only option close to this is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_central. Let me recompute:

Each central pair: U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2 m).

So, k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So (2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*(2.566e-38)=1.026e-37 C².

So U per pair:8.988e9 *1.026e-37 /2.

= (8.988e9 *1.026e-37 )/2.

8.988e9 *1.026e-37 =9.22e-28.

Divide by 2:4.61e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 *4.61e-28=5.53e-27 J.

So this is correct.

Looking at the options, none match this. But option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times our result. Maybe I missed a factor of 5 somewhere. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is not only at 2 m from P but also at 2 m from each other. But that's not physically possible unless they are all at the same point, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from each other. Wait, but that would require them all to be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, but the mutual distances would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is exactly 2 m apart from each other, which would imply that they form a regular icosahedron around P, but each edge is 2 m. But in reality, in a regular icosahedron, the edge length is related to the radius, which for a sphere of radius r, the edge length a is about 0.951r. So if the radius is 2 m, the edge length (distance between adjacent charges) would be about 1.902 m. But for all pairs, the distance is not 2 m, only adjacent pairs. So perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming all mutual distances are 2 m, leading to each mutual pair contributing (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) = same as central pairs.

In that case, the mutual potential energy would be 66 *4.61e-28 =3.04e-26 J.

Adding the central contribution of5.53e-27 J, the total U=3.04e-26 +5.53e-27 =3.59e-26 J.

Which is about 3.59e-26 J. Still, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, sometimes k is approximated as 9e9 N·m²/C². Let me recalculate using k=9e9.

Using k=9e9 N·m²/C².

U_central per pair:9e9 *4e²/(2) =9e9 *2e².

e²=2.566e-38 C².

So 2e²=5.132e-38.

9e9 *5.132e-38=4.619e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs:5.543e-27 J.

Mutual pairs, if each is 2 meters apart:

66 pairs *4.619e-28=3.04e-26 J.

Total U=3.59e-26 J.

Still no match.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps the correct approach is to only consider the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding, which gives us approximately 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is2.822e-26, which is approximately (5.5e-27)*5.13, which is about 5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. So the system has a total of 13 charges, each 2e. But wait, no, the central is fixed, and the 12 are around it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each pair between the central and the 12 as separate, but also including the mutual interactions, but in a different way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a capacitor, but that doesn't seem applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated using the formula U = (n *k q^2)/(r), where n is the number of charges.

Wait, but in our case, the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e. So each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as before.

So 12 charges contribute 12*(k*(2e)^2/(2)) =12*(8.988e9 *4e²/(2)).

Which is same as 12*(8.988e9 *2e²)=12*(17.976e-29)=2.157e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option. Option C is7.056e-27, which is about 3.3 times higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the central charge and also to each other. So the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs. But without knowing mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that all mutual distances are 2 meters as well. Let's try that.

So, 12 central pairs, each contributing 4.61e-28 J.

66 mutual pairs, each contributing 4.61e-28 J.

Total U = (12 +66)*4.61e-28 =78 *4.61e-28=3.59e-26 J.

Which is about 3.59e-26 J.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge as (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2), but the system's total energy is the sum of all such terms, including the central charge itself. But that doesn't make sense because the central charge is fixed and doesn't move.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges and the central charge, but not the mutual interactions. So the answer would be 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me check the exponents again.

When calculating 12 * (8.988e9 *4e²/(2)), which is 12*(8.988e9 *2e²) =12*(17.976e-29) =2.157e-27 J.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2e²=8.988e9 *2*(1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 2*(1.602e-19)^2=2*(2.566e-38)=5.132e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:8.988e9 *5.132e-38=4.598e-28.

Multiply by12:5.518e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest is option B (2.822e-26), which is about 5 times higher than our calculated U_central. But I can't see where that factor of 5 would come from.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value. The problem says each charge is 2e. So each is 2 times the elementary charge. So q=2e=3.204e-19 C.

But in the U_central calculation, I correctly used 2e for each charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U=(3/5)(k Q²)/(R) for the shell and adding the central contribution.

As calculated earlier, the shell's potential energy is about4.0e-26 J, and the central contribution is5.5e-27 J.

So total U=4.55e-26 J.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is considering only the shell's self-energy, which is4.0e-26 J. Option A is5.645e-26, which is higher than this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in electronvolts (eV) instead of joules, but the options are in J. So no.

After going through all these possibilities, I think the intended approach is to consider only the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges, which gives us approximately5.5e-27 J. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is roughly five times higher. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct calculation should involve considering each of the 12 charges as 2e and the central as 2e, leading to U_central =12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)] =12 * [8.988e9 *4e²/(2)] =12 * [8.988e9 *2e²].

Wait, let me recalculate that accurately.

e²=2.566e-38 C².

2e²=5.132e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 =4.598e-28.

Multiply by12:5.518e-27 J.

So the correct answer should be approximately5.5e-27 J. But this isn't among the options. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is2.822e-26, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in terms of the work done to bring all 12 charges to their positions, considering the central charge's potential and the mutual potentials. But earlier, when I calculated that, the total was about3.6e-26 J, which is near option B.

But option B is2.822e-26, which is about 78% of 3.6e-26. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy due to the central charge and one of the surrounding charges, multiplied by 12. But that would give (12)*(k*(2e)^2/(2))= same as U_central=5.5e-27 J.

I'm not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on my calculations, the U_central is5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B, considering mutual interactions.

But without more information, I'm not sure. I'll have to pick the option that aligns with the calculation I think is correct.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The central charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairwise interactions.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and Each Surrounding Charge**:
   Each surrounding charge contributes a potential energy term with the central charge:
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). Substituting \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 4.598 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Since there are 12 surrounding charges, the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{total, central}} = 12 \cdot 4.598 \times 10^{-28} = 5.518 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Surrounding Charges**:
   The mutual potential energy depends on the distances between the surrounding charges. If the charges are uniformly distributed on a spherical shell of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the average distance between two charges on the shell is \( \frac{3R}{\pi} \approx 1.91 \, \text{m} \). The potential energy for each pair of surrounding charges is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{1.91} = k \frac{4e^2}{1.91}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{1.91} = 9.23 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs of surrounding charges, so the total mutual potential energy is:
   \[
   U_{\text{total, mutual}} = 66 \cdot 9.23 \times 10^{-28} = 6.09 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the contributions:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{total, central}} + U_{\text{total, mutual}}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 5.518 \times 10^{-27} + 6.09 \times 10^{-26} = 6.64 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option A**: \( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) — Too low.
- **Option B**: \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) — Too low.
- **Option C**: \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) — Too low.
- **Option D**: \( 122.330 \, \text{J} \) — Far too high.

The calculated total potential energy (\( 6.64 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the potential energy contribution between the central charge and the surrounding charges alone (\( 5.518 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is **Option C** (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)), which is approximately 28% higher. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or an issue with the problem's setup.

ANSWER: C
