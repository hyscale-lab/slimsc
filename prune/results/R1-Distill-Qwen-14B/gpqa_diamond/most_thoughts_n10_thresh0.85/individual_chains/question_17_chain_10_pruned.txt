Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex would form, and the formation constant K is involved in the dissociation of this complex.

So, the formation constant K is given by the formula K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, right. Because the EDTA is a hexadentate ligand; it binds the metal in a 1:1 ratio, so the formula makes sense.

But wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the concentration as C = 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the complex is fully formed, but since K is large (5e10), it should be mostly dissociated? Or no, wait, no—wait, K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. A large K means the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So, in 0.02 M solution of Ca-EDTA, most of it would be as the complex, with very little calcium and EDTA ions dissociated.

But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. If the complex is dissociating, then [Ca²+] would be small because K is large, so the dissociation is minimal. So, I can model this by setting up an equilibrium expression.

Let me think: the complex is CaEDTA^2- which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is made by adding the complex, and that initially, [CaEDTA^2-
