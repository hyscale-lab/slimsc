Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (beta values) are involved here. 

Wait, stability constants determine the stability of complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, the complex with the highest beta is the most stable. But the question is about the percentage of a specific complex, which is the dithiocyanato one. I think dithiocyanato would be the Co with two SCN- ligands.

The given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Usually, the beta increases as more ligands are attached because each step is more favorable. But here, β3 is higher than β2, which makes sense if each step is more stable. But β4 is 16, which is less than β3. That seems odd. Oh wait, maybe the order of the complexes is different. Let me think: the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n+, [Co(SCN)_2]^n+, and so on. So, β1 is the first association, β2 is the second, etc.

Wait, let me clarify: the stability constant β for a complex [MLn] is given by β = [MLn]/([M][L]^n). So for each step, you multiply the previous beta by the next beta for the next ligand. So for CoSCN^+ (n=1), β1 is 9. For Co(SCN)_2^+, β2 would be β1 multiplied by the next step's beta, which is another beta value. Wait, wait no, actually, the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise beta values up to n. So β_total for the n=1 complex is β1, for n=2 it's β1*β2, for n=3 it's β1*β2*β3, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants. So for the first ligand, K1 = β1. For the second,
