Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives me some spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I remember that each of these techniques gives different kinds of information about the compound. Let me go through each one and see what I can deduce.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but sometimes it's a bit lower. Also, maybe it's an alcohol, which has a less broad but still prominent O-H peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but I don't think so because ethers don't have O-H bonds. Wait, no—ethers have C-O-C, but no hydroxyls, so no O-H stretch. So, the presence of a broad peak suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or maybe a phenol?

Then, the FTIR also has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe it's another type of carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, what about conjugation? For example, in a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. The conjugation would lower the carbonyl stretching frequency. So, perhaps the compound has more than one carbonyl group, or maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Because aromatic C=C stretches are usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So maybe 1650 is in that range. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester with an adjacent double bond.

So putting the IR together: the broad peak suggests an O-H group, maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The 1700 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps ester or ketone. The 1650 could be either another carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. The question says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the presence of vinyl H suggests that there's at least one double bond in the structure. That could be part of an alkene or perhaps an aromatic ring, but aromatic protons usually have different shifts. But wait, vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-7 ppm, maybe? Or in the range of 5-7 ppm, depending on substitution and neighboring groups.

So, the NMR having vinyl H implies a double bond. Maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But since the FTIR has peaks around 1700 and 1650, perhaps it's an ester or something with a conjugated double bond.

Now, the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments: Maybe a (CH3)2O group, but that's 45? Let's see, (CH3)2O is [(12*2)+(1*6)+(16)] = 24 +6 +16=46? No, that's 46. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion? Not sure. Or perhaps a water molecule is lost, but that would be 18. Or maybe a CO group is lost, which would be 28. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be CH3CO (acetate), which is (12+1*3 +12 +16 +16) ? No, wait, CH3CO is (12*2) + (1*4) + (16*2) = 24 +4 +32 = 60, which is too high. Hmm. What about a (CH2O) group? Let me calculate the molecular weight of that. CH2O is 12 + 2 + 16 = 30, which is lower than 45. Maybe a (C3H6O) group? 3*12 +6 +16=36+6+16=58. No.

Wait, let me think of the possible fragments. Another common fragment is the methyl group (15), but again, that's lower. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion minus something. Wait, the molecular formula is one of four options: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, let me check what the molecular weight of each would be:

C6H12O: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 16=16. Total 72+12+16=100.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O2:72 +12 +32=116.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. So, if the molecular ion is around 114 or 116, then losing a part to get 45. Let's see: 114 -45=69. 116-45=71. Are 69 or 71 significant? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is formed from part of the molecule. Oh! What about the acetate group. The acetate ion is 60 (CH3COO^-), but that's higher than 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to oxygen, like OCH2CH3, which is ethoxy group. The molecular weight of ethoxy is 45 (12 +16 + 2*1=45?). Wait, wait: O is 16, CH2CH3 is 12 +2 +3=17. So 16 +17=33? No, that's not right. Wait, OCH2CH3 is an ethoxy group, which is 12 (CH2) +12 (CH3) +16 (O) + 2 H2 (but H doesn't add much). Wait, OCH2CH3: the formula is C2H5O. Molecular weight is (2*12) + (5*1) +16=24 +5 +16=45. Oh, that's it! So the fragment could be the ethoxy group, OCH2CH3, which has a molecular weight of 45. So that would suggest that the molecule has an ethoxy group.

So, if the fragment is OCH2CH3, then the compound must include an ethoxy group. So looking at the options, which have an O? The options are C6H10O, C6H12O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

An ethoxy group is (OCH2CH3), which contributes an O and two carbons. So in the formula, the main molecule would have that.

So the molecular formula would have to include O, and possibly another O if it's ester or something else.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the compound has an ethoxy group, and a carbonyl group (from IR), then maybe it's an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, an ether, but if it's an ester, that would explain the carbonyl peak.

So if the structure is an ester, like ethyl something ester, then the formula would be something like RCOOCH2CH3. Let's see, for example, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula there is C5H10O2. But our options are C6... So perhaps a six-carbon ester.

Wait, our options go up to six carbons. Let's try to think of what the structure would be.

If the compound is an ester, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms, because esters are R-O-CO-R', so two oxygen in the ester group. So the formula would be CnH2mO2. Let's see the options: option C is C6H10O2. That would have 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. So that makes sense for an ester (since esters are R-O-CO-R', so that's two O's).

Alternatively, the mass spec fragment could be something else. But the fact that the fragment is 45 (matching ethoxy) suggests that the compound includes an ethoxy group.

Now, looking back at the FTIR. The broad peak suggests an O-H group. Wait, but if it's an ester, where is the O-H coming from? Because esters don't have an O-H; wait, unless it's a carboxylic acid ester or something else. Oh wait, no—esters don't have O-H. So if the FTIR has a broad O-H peak, then perhaps the compound isn't an ester but something else with an O-H group.

Hmm, now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Broad peak at 3000: O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But then why the ester carbonyl? Or perhaps it's a hemiacetal, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. Like a secondary or tertiary alcohol. But in that case, the O-H would be less broad, perhaps, unless it's a very acidic O-H, like in a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a glycol ester or something else. Or perhaps it's a β-keto ester, but that might not explain the O-H.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative. Wait, but the presence of a vinyl group suggests an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond, like an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOEt. That would have a conjugated double bond next to the ester carbonyl. That would lower the carbonyl's stretching frequency, which might explain the 1700 and 1650 peaks. Wait, but the 1650 peak—could that be the conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe the double bond's stretching.

In an α,β-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl would be at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) might have a stretch around 1650 cm^-1. So that could explain the two peaks.

So if the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, let's see its formula. That would be C5H8O2. But our options are for C6. Hmm. So perhaps something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's see: that would be C6H10O2. That's option C. That fits. Let's see: the formula would be C6H10O2. The ester group is O-CO-O, so O2. The double bond would be the vinyl H in NMR.

Wait, but then let's check the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 would still be O-H, but an ester doesn't have an O-H. So that's a problem. Unless the compound is a diol ester, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group that's part of the molecule, not from the ester. So maybe another functional group is present. For example, a hydroxyl group and an ester. So, a compound like HO-R-CO-O-R'. That would introduce both O-H and an ester.

But then the formula would have two O's. Let me think of the molecular formula. If the main chain is a diol ester or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would be one O for the ketone and another O for the alcohol, making two O's.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a strong carbonyl. If the compound has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an OH group, then that could explain the O-H peak. But why is the O-H peak broad? It might be an alcohol, which can have a broad O-H stretch, but maybe it's a carboxylic acid if it's very broad.

Wait, let me think of a structure. Suppose the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A lactone would have an ester group (so a carbonyl at 1700) and an O-H if it's opened up, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with both a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a β-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH3COCH2CH2OH. But then, the IR would have a carbonyl at 1700 (maybe a bit lower for a keto group), and an O-H from the alcohol. But in that case, the O-H would be from an alcohol, maybe a broad peak.

But let's see the formula. For CH3COCH2CH2OH, the formula would be C4H8O2. That's not matching any of the options, which are all C6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is C6H10O2, which would be option C. Let me think of a possible structure with two O's and six carbons, including an O-H and a carbonyl.

Another possibility is a diethyl acetal. But that would have ethers, so no O-H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's a possible structure. Let's check:

The formula would be C6H12O3? No. Wait, HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH3: the formula is C6H12O3? Because the ester group is O2, and the hydroxyl is O1. So total three O's. But none of the options have three O's. The options are either O, O2, O, or O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the IR and the other data.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. It also has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700
