Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition, which I remember involves enolate ions reacting with alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyls. Right, the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The product is usually a new carbon-carbon bond and an enolate intermediate.

Looking at the problem, there are three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2. So when the base removes a proton from the central carbon, the enolate would have a negative charge on that central carbon. The enolate would then attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the E configuration means the substituents on each end are opposite.

In the Michael addition, the enolate's nucleophilic carbon (the one that's been deprotonated) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the attack would happen on the CH2 part of CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. That would add the malonate's part to the beta position.

So the product would be a new compound where the enolate's R groups are attached. Let me visualize it: the acrylate after attack would have the malonate's CH2CO2Me groups added to the beta position. So the structure would become a longer chain, with substituents from both reactants.

Wait, the acrylate is E, but upon attack, the geometry doesn't change much. The product would be a conjugated system perhaps. So the product would be something like CH2-C(CO2Me)2 connected to the p-tolyl group. Let me think about the structure.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-(COPh)OCH3. When the enolate (from malonate) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the structure would become CH2-C(CO2Me)2-OCH3 attached to the CH2-CH-(COPh)OCH3. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a triester. Because dimethyl malonate has two methyl esters, and upon adding another ester group, it would form a trimethyl ester.

Wait, the product after the reaction would have the enolate adding to the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate from malonate is the central CH- of (CH3CO)2CH- , which is deprotonated to CH(-) (COOCH3)2.

So attacking the beta carbon (CH2) of the acrylate, the enolate would add across, leading to a new bond. The product would have the structure CH2-C(CO2Me)2 attached to the rest.

Wait, maybe the product is a triester. So the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-C-(CH2-COPh)-C(O)OCH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate from malonate (which is (CH3CO)2CH^-) attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of the acrylate, leading to:

The enolate adds to the CH2, so the CH2 becomes CH- with the malonate
