Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and exoplanets. Let's see what it's about. I remember that transiting planets are easier to detect when their orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They both have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1 would be 100 days. 

Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The host stars are different: the star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, same radius but different masses. I think more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_1's host is in a different evolutionary stage, making it a bit smaller. But the question says both stars have the same radius, so that's key.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. The probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but wait, actually, it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size. The formula I remember is something like the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not it. Oh right, the formula is usually approximated as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Let me clarify. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula is (R_*/a(1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's R_*/a. 

Wait, no, actually, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet has to be in the right plane, so the probability is about (R_star / a) * something.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P_transit ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)))) ), but since the planets have the same mass and the stars have different masses, this might play a role. Alternatively, wait, the transit probability for a circular orbit is P = (R_star / a) * (some function). 

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_* + R_p) / a. But often, when R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximated as R_* / a. Since both are Earth-like, R_p is much smaller than R_*, so we can ignore it.

So P_transit ≈ (R_star) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but e
