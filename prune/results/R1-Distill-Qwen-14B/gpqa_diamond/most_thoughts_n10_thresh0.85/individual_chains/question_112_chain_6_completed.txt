Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, this is a two-level system, probably spin-½, since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates.

First, I need to normalize the state. Because the coefficients are given as (1+i) and (2-i), I should find the normalization factor. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, for (2 - i), it's sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So the norm squared would be (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional. So the actual state would be |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about another operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The matrix A would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So,

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

I remember that such a matrix is related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Or wait, is it? Let me check: sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on diagonal. So A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but the operator we're considering is A. The question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. Oh, right, because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the eigenstates.

So I need to find the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates. Wait, sigma_x has eigenstates that are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. Those are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis, which are |+x> and |-x> states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize A and find its eigenvectors.

So let me think: the matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. To find eigenvalues, solve det(A - λ I) = 0.

The determinant equation is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The eigenstates can be found by solving (A - λ I)|v> = 0.

For λ = hbar/2:

[ -hbar/2    hbar/2 ] [v1]   = 0
[ hbar/2    -hbar/2 ] [v2]

Which simplifies to -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Normalizing, it's (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

[ hbar/2    hbar/2 ] [v1]   =0
[ hbar/2    hbar/2 ]

Which gives v1 = -v2. So eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, because in our basis, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1). So the eigenstate for λ = hbar/2 is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and for λ=-hbar/2, it's (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up>, |down> basis. We need to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue of A, which corresponds to projecting |alpha> onto |+> and |->.

So I need to compute the inner products of |alpha> with |+> and |->.

First, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Expressed as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis, it's ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Now, the eigenstate |+> is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))^T, and |-> is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2))^T.

The inner product between |alpha> and |+>, which is the amplitude for |+>, is:

< + | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i +2 -i = 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3 / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3)^2 / (14) ) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product with |-> is:

< - | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * ( -1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Oh, because the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), the magnitude squared is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 /14.

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5. So 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. That's probably the right one. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, which rounds to approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which would be about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. The options have 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1. So that's correct.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But since A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities we just found are 9/14 and 5/14, the average value would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Which is [9/14 -5/14] (hbar/2) )= (4/14) (hbar/2) )= (2/7) (hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

Wait, 4/14 is 2/7. So 2/7 multiplied by hbar/2 is (2 * hbar) / (14) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7. That matches option A, which says hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recheck the probabilities. Because sometimes normalization can trip me up.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So when I compute the inner product with |+>, which is (1,1)/sqrt(2), it's [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) = [3] / sqrt(14) → 3/sqrt(14).

Then the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14≈0.6428. Similarly, the other eigenstate gives 5/14≈0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, as I calculated.

So the average is correct as hbar/7.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a two-level system described by the state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The state is normalized by dividing by the norm of the coefficients, which is √7, giving |α⟩ = (1+i)/√7 |up⟩ + (2-i)/√7 |down⟩. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator **A**, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of **A**.

### Step 1: Eigenstates of A
The matrix representation of **A** is:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of **A** are ±ℏ/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ − |down⟩).
\]

### Step 2: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩, we compute the inner products of |α⟩ with these eigenstates:
\[
⟨+|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨−|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:
\[
P(+|α⟩) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-|α⟩) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Average Value of A
The average value of **A** is given by the expectation value ⟨α|A|α⟩. Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of **A** is ℏ/7. These results match option A.

**Answer: A**
