Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. Oh wait, right, parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is inversely proportional.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky, so that probably means their distances are spread out in a certain way. Wait, but how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax?

So, maybe I should think about the volume of space at a certain distance. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume would depend on the size of that volume. So, for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the volume involved?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, the distance from the Earth to a star with parallax plx is d = 1/plx parsecs. Now, if I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by dr. So, volume dV = 4π d² dr.

But since parallax plx = 1/d, dr would be the change in distance. Let's express dr in terms of plx. Because d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is increasing as d decreases. Hmm, but maybe the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can ignore it for calculating magnitude.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume, dV becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ), but since we're considering the absolute value, the volume element in terms of parallax would be dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Wait, dr is the change in distance, which in terms of plx is dplx = (change in pl
