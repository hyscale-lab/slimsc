Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a typo in the way it's written here. Oh, the user wrote it as L(y) = -λ f bar_psi f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Maybe that's supposed to be the interaction term.

Wait, the correct interaction term for a boson coupling to fermions would typically be something like L = g ψ† ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. Since the given term is -λ f bar_psi f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y), maybe that's a typo, but perhaps it's written as L = -λ (ψ_f† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)), which would make more sense. Or perhaps it's a Yukawa-like term where the boson X couples to a fermion in a mass term. Hmm.

Wait, considering that the interaction is given as L = -λ f bar_psi f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y), perhaps that's the same as L = -λ (bar_psi_f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y)), which would be similar to a Yukawa coupling. So the boson X is coupled to the fermion f with a coupling strength λ. 

In Yukawa interactions, the coupling is typically between a scalar field and a fermion-antifermion pair. So, in this case, the boson X would mediate interactions between fermions. For decay processes, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided that the energy (mass of X) is sufficient to produce the pair.

Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, I need to find all possible fermion-antifermion pairs whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in the decay X → f f-bar, the invariant mass of the pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. 

So, let me list the masses of all known fermions (excluding the top quark, which is way heavier):

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but in this case, since neutrinos have negligible mass, their pairs would require only 2*m_nu, which is negligible. However, since the Lagrangian doesn't seem to include neutrinos (only f and psi_f, which I think are charged fermions), perhaps neutrinos aren't involved here.

So, the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into must have a total mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible option:

1. b quark pair (b b-bar): each b is ~4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So any option including b b-bar is incorrect.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays into two particles, each of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV/2, because in the center-of-mass frame, each particle's energy is at least their rest mass. So the maximum mass for a fermion f that can be produced is when X is at rest and the two fermions are emitted back-to-back with the minimum possible kinetic energy. So the maximum possible mass for each f is m_f ≤ M_X / 2. 

So M_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

So let me see the masses:

- b quark: ~4.5 GeV. 4.5 > 3, so can't have b b-bar. So any option with b quarks is wrong.

- c quark: 1.2-1.5 GeV. 1.5 < 3, so can decay into c c-bar.

s quark: ~100 MeV, so s s-bar is allowed.

u and d: way lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

Tau pair: τ has ~1.78 GeV. 1.78 <3, so τ+τ- is allowed.

Electron and muon: their masses are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.

But wait, let's think about the possible pairs:

X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is ≤6 GeV. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when X is at rest, the decay products can have any combination as long as each particle's rest mass is ≤ M_X / 2. Because in the decay process, each fermion's energy must be at least their rest mass. So the maximum possible mass for each fermion is M_X/2. So for X=6 GeV, each f must be ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3, so allowed. c is around 1.5 GeV, okay. b is 4.5, which is larger than 3, so no.

So possible fermions that can be produced are:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bar b, s bar s, u bar u, d bar d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

But since b is too heavy, option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

That includes all the allowed fermions except for the b quark. So this is a possibility.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

But t is too heavy (173 GeV), so this option includes t which can't be decay products. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bar b, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Again, includes b which is too heavy. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider the charges as well? The Lagrangian given is -λ f bar_psi f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, perhaps I misread the Lagrangian. Let me think again: the term would be something like bar_psi_f (y) X(y) psi_f(y), which is a Yukawa coupling. So X couples to the fermion f. So the decay X → f f-bar would be possible if the coupling is allowed, which depends on the electric charge or any other quantum numbers.

Wait, but fermions come in different types. For example, X could couple to up-type quarks, down-type quarks, etc. But the problem states that the interaction is with fermions f, so perhaps X can couple to any fermion, but in reality, the coupling may only exist for certain types.

Wait, but in this problem, the Lagrangian is given, and it's written as -λ f bar_psi f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). So, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling where X couples to a specific fermion f. But in the multiple-choice options, the decay products include various fermions, implying that X may couple to multiple types.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is such that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided they meet the mass condition.

But perhaps the actual point is that the coupling is allowed for any fermion, and so the allowed decays are based purely on mass. So the correct decay channels are those where the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV, which includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So, looking at the options, option B includes all these except b and t.

Wait, the options given in the problem are:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−

So, that's all the allowed ones except for b, which is too heavy.

Wait, but wait: the tau is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So, yes, τ+τ− is allowed. Similarly, the muon is about 105 MeV, which is way under 3 GeV.

So the correct allowed decays are those in option B.

But looking again, the options don't have all of them. Let me check:

Option B includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The Lagrangian describes a Yukawa-like coupling between the boson \( X \) and a fermion \( f \), allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematics of the decay require that the rest mass of each fermion in the pair must be less than or equal to \( M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), as the energy of each fermion in the center-of-mass frame must be at least its rest mass.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
4. **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 4.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
9. **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which have masses less than or equal to \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden because \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), as given in **Option B**.
