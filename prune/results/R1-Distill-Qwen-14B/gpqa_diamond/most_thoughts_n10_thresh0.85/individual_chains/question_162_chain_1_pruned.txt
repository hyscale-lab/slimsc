Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

So, the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). And the question is about finding the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. The options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, wait. First, I should recall what a pseudosphere is. I think a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But in this context, the metric is given in terms of x and y. Oh, maybe it's a 2-dimensional space described by this metric.

Looking at the metric, it's written in terms of dx² and dy², multiplied by a factor that depends on x² + y². The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So, the structure of the metric is similar to a conformally flat metric in 2D. In such cases, the line element is often written as ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function. The area element in such a case would be dA = sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, for a 2D metric, the determinant is the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy² minus the square of the cross terms. Since there are no cross terms (like dxdy), the determinant g is just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (1) * (1) - 0 = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, wait. No, sqrt(g) would be sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). So the area element is (sqrt(32)/sqrt(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But before calculating the area, I need to figure out the region over which we integrate. The metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that this term must be positive to avoid singularities or imaginary distances. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Ah, because when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So the area is over the disk of radius 2.

So the area A would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

The area becomes A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [sqrt(32/(4 - r²))] * r dr dθ.

Simplify the integrand: sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²) = 4√2 / sqrt(4 - r²).

So A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [4√2 r / sqrt(4 - r²)] dr.

The integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * 4√2 ∫0^2 [ r / sqrt(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral I = ∫0^2 [ r / sqrt(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → dr = -du/(2r). Wait, but when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So I = ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ r / sqrt(u) ] * (-du/(2r)) )

The r cancels, and the negative sign reverses the limits:

I = ∫ (u=0 to u=4) [1/sqrt(u)] * (du/(2)) )

So I = (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) u^(-1/2) du.

The integral of u^(-1/2) is 2 u^(1/2). So,

I = (1/2) * [ 2 sqrt(u) ] from 0 to4 = [sqrt(u)] from 0 to4 = sqrt(4) - sqrt(0) = 2 - 0 =2.

So the radial integral I =2.

Putting it back into the area:

A = 2π *4√2 * 2 = 2π *8√2 = 16√2 π.

Wait, but the options don't include that. The options are 0, 4π(x²+y²), ..., so probably I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait a second. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere. But in the metric given, the coordinates x and y are in the plane, but the metric is conformally flat. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic space, but perhaps this metric represents something else.

Wait, maybe the metric is that of a pseudosphere's surface. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but here we're dealing with a 2D metric. Alternatively, perhaps this is the metric of a hyperbolic plane, which has constant negative curvature.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So in conformal form, f(x,y) = (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32/(4 -x² -y²). Hmm.

I remember that in the hyperbolic plane, a common metric is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² - a²), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, when I think of the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, the metric is ds² = 4(dx² + dy²)/(1 - x² - y²)^2. But here, the denominator is (4 -x² -y²), so perhaps it's a scaled version.

Wait, but the area of a pseudosphere... Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, so its area is infinite. Because for a surface of revolution with negative curvature, it's like a horn; the area increases as you go to infinity. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but in this case, the metric is defined only up to a certain radius. Wait, no, the denominator is 4 -x² -y², which is positive when x² + y² <4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2. But that would imply that the maximum r is 2, but that's in the x-y plane as used in the metric.

Wait, but the pseudosphere of radius r=2—what's the relation between the radius and the metric? Oh, perhaps the r in the question refers to the curvature radius. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is of a hyperbolic plane with a certain curvature, and the area is infinite.

Wait, if the surface is a pseudosphere, which is a finite area? No, wait, a pseudosphere's surface area is actually infinite because it's like a funnel that extends infinitely. But wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given is for a sphere embedded in some space? Or perhaps this is a compact surface.

Wait, the metric has a denominator that approaches zero as r approaches 2, so near r=2, the curvature becomes infinite. So the space is finite in extent—up to r=2. So perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the area as 16√2 π. But that's not one of the options. The options are 0, 4π(x²+y²), 4π(x² -y²), +infty.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the metric's denominator is (4 -x² - y^2)^2, but in this question, it is just (4 -x² - y^2). So perhaps the area is infinite.

Wait, but the integral I computed was finite because the integration is up to r=2, and the integrand's behavior is manageable. Wait, let me recheck the integral.

The radial integral I had was ∫0^2 r / sqrt(4 - r²) dr = 2. So A =2π *4√2 *2 = 16√2 π. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, but the metric given is not of a pseudosphere but of a different surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the area formula wrong. Wait, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So in the metric ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²), the determinant g is (32/(4 -x² -y²)) * 1 *1 - 0 = 32/(4 -x² -y²). So sqrt(g) is sqrt(32/(4 -x² -y²)) = 4√2 / sqrt(4 -x² -y²).

Thus, dA = (4√2 / sqrt(4 -x² -y²)) dx dy. So integrating over x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, when I did the integral, I found 16√2 π. But none of the options match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is +infty. So why would the area be infinite?

Wait, perhaps the metric is actually defined for r beyond 2, but that's not the case because the denominator becomes zero or negative beyond r=2. So the space is only defined within r <2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me double-check:

The area integral is A = ∫
