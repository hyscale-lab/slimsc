Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. We're supposed to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the brightness variations as these spots do.

So, the problem is a bit about photometric time-series observations, which measure brightness changes. When a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star blocks some light, causing a dip too. The question is, what size planet would cause a dip of the same amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the star has a hemisphere covered in spots. So, the spots are on a hemisphere, which is half the star. But the filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So, spots cover 20% of 50% of the star's surface. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface.

I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by these spots. Then, find what's the planet radius that would cause the same dip when transiting.

First, let's model the brightness change due to the spots.

The star's total luminosity without any spots would be L0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff⁴. Since Rstar is the same as the Sun's radius, but the temperature is 6000 K. Wait, but when spots are present, they are cooler. The spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since the star is rotating, the spots on one hemisphere will come into view as the star spins. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when viewed edge-on, the spots would appear as a varying area as the star rotates.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots on one side (the visible hemisphere) will be seen as they rotate. The problem says it's only one hemisphere with spots. So when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view, the spots are visible. But wait, when you're looking at a star, you can't see the entire hemisphere at once because it's a sphere. Hmm, perhaps I should model the brightness variation caused by spots as the star rotates.

But maybe a better approach is to calculate the maximum and minimum flux from the star due to the spots, then find the amplitude in brightness.

The star without spots has a certain flux. When spots are visible, they reduce the flux because they're cooler and emit less. The maximum dip in brightness would occur when the maximum area of spots is visible. Wait, but since the spots are on a single hemisphere, perhaps the maximum number of spots visible at any time is when the hemisphere is fully facing us
