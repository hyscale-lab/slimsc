Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that when we observe this star, its brightness variations due to rotation look like those from an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, okay. So I think this involves understanding how both starspots and transiting exoplanets affect the observed brightness. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, starspots can cause variations because when the spots rotate into and out of view, they absorb less light (since they're cooler), so the total brightness changes.

Wait, but the problem says that with the star having these spots, the brightness variation is similar to that of a planet transit. So we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

So the key here is to find the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) due to the spots and then equate it to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

First, let's think about the star without spots. The star's total flux is F = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²) ), but when a planet transits, it blocks an area proportional to (Rplanet/Rstar)^2. So the flux change would be ΔF_planet = (Rplanet/Rstar)^2.

But in the spotted case, the situation is a bit different. Because the spots are cooler, when they're on the star's surface, they contribute less flux. So the total flux from the star when spots are visible is less than when they're not.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the star's surface is covered in spots. And each spot has a lower temperature, which affects the flux.

Let me break it down. The total flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²) ) = σTeff^4 Rstar² / D².

But when the star is spotted, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)), where f is the filling factor (0.2), because the spots contribute less flux. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions. The unspotted area is (1 - f) fraction of the surface, each part emitting at Teff^4. The spotted area is f fraction, each part emitting at (Teff - ΔT)^4. So the total flux is F = σ*Teff^4 * (1 - f) * (4πRstar²)/(4πD²) ) + σ*(Teff - ΔT)^4 * f * (4πRstar²)/(4πD²) )

Which simplifies to F = σRstar²/(D²) [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]

So the change in flux when the spots are visible compared to when there are no spots (unspotted) is F_spotted - F_unspotted = σRstar²/(D²) [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 - Teff^4 ]

Simplify that: = σRstar²/(D²) [ - f Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]

= f σ Rstar²/(D²) [ (Teff - ΔT)^4 - Teff^4 ] 

Wait, but wait—this is the flux when the spots are on the side facing us. When the star isn't spotted in our view, perhaps the spots are on the far side, so the flux is higher. So the maximum flux is when the spots are not visible to us, and the minimum when they are.

But the amplitude of variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation due to rotation modulates the spots' visibility, creating a periodic change. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The maximum brightness occurs when the spots are not visible (all the bright parts are facing us), and the minimum when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but when a spot is on the visible hemisphere, the flux is lower. So the maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum when they're on our side.

But in the problem, the filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere. Wait, no—filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. So when the star rotates, the fraction of the surface visible to us that is spotted changes.

Wait, maybe I should model the star as a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and when it does, 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, only a hemisphere is visible. So perhaps the spots are on one side, so when that side is facing us, the spots are visible. Since the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, it's a main sequence star.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the flux change when the spots are on the visible hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted is 20% of the entire star's surface (so 10% of the hemisphere we see?), but wait no—filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So when we see the hemisphere that is covered in spots, the fraction of the surface we see that's spotted is 20% of the entire surface, which is half of what's visible. So 20% of the entire surface is 10% of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The filling factor is the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. So if the entire star has 20% spots, then when that side is facing us, 20% of the entire star is visible. Because the star is a sphere, when you see a hemisphere, the area is 2πR². The total area is 4πR². So filling factor f is 20% of the entire area, so 0.2 *4πR² = 0.8π R². So when the hemisphere with the spots is facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.8π R² (since that's 20% of the entire star). The area of the hemisphere we can see is 2π R². So the fraction of the visible area that's spotted is (0.8π R²) / (2π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40% of the hemisphere.

Wait, that can't be right because if f is 20% of the entire star, and the star's visible hemisphere is half the surface, then the spotted area in that hemisphere is 20% of the entire star's surface. So if the entire star is 4πR², 20% is 0.8π R². But the visible area at any time is 2π R². So the fraction of the visible area that is spotted is 0.8π R² / 2π R² = 0.4, which is 40% of the visible area.

Wait, but the problem says the star is covered in dark spots on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the visible hemisphere, not of the entire star. That would make more sense. Because if it's one hemisphere, then the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total filling factor for the star is 10% (since a hemisphere is half the surface). Because 20% of half the star's surface is 0.2 * (4π R² / 2) ) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the filling factor for the entire star is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 10%.

Wait, but the question states "a hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is covered in spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the entire star's surface is 4 π R², so the filling factor is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's entire surface is covered by spots.

Wait, no, because when the star's other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side. So for the purpose of the observed brightness, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 20% of that hemisphere as spots. So the area of the spots we see is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star's surface is 4 π R², so the fraction of the entire star that's spotted is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, 10%.

But I'm not entirely certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the visible hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, 20% of that hemisphere is spots, which is 10% of the entire star. So overall, the star has 10% of its surface covered in spots.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the flux change when the spots are visible.

So the flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4 π Rstar²) / (4 π D²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar² / D².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot / Teff)^4 ]

Because each spot contributes (T_spot / Teff)^4 times the flux per unit area of the unspotted regions.

Now, the problem states that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f * (5000/6000)^4 ]

The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is (F_spotted - F0) / F0 = [ (1-f) + f*(5000/6000)^4 ] - 1 = -f [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Wait no, let me compute it correctly:

(F_spotted - F0)/F0 = [ (1-f) + f*(5000/6000)^4 - 1 ] = -f + f*(5000/6000)^4 = f [ (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ]

Wait, but that would give a negative value, which makes sense because the flux is decreasing when spots are visible.

Wait, but the amplitude we're interested in is the difference between when the maximum flux occurs (no spots visible) and the minimum (spots fully visible). So when the star is spotted, its flux is lower. The maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F_spotted.

So the amplitude (ΔF) is F0 - F_spotted.

So (F0 - F_spotted) / F0 = 1 - [ (1-f) + f*(T_spot/Teff)^4 ]

= 1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot/Teff)^4

= f [ 1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ]

So that's the fractional change in flux.

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.2,

T_spot = 5000 K,

Teff = 6000 K,

So (5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So the fractional change is 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549, or about 10.355% decrease in flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, but that's the change when the spots are visible. But wait, the star is only showing one hemisphere. So when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0, and when they are on the near side, it's F_spotted. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 ≈ 10.355% of F0.

Wait, but the question says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude caused by the planet would be the same as the amplitude caused by the spots.

In the case of a transiting planet, the flux change is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the planet blocks that part of the star's light.

So the amplitude for the planet transit is A_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We are to find R_planet / R_star such that A_planet equals the amplitude caused by the spots, which is approximately 0.10355 (10.355%).

Wait, wait, no. The amplitude from the planet is a dip of A_planet = (R_planet/R_star)^2. So the fractional change in flux is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

So we set (R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking the square root, R_planet/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218. So approximately 0.32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I got the amplitude right. Because the star's flux decreases by about 10.35%, so the planet transit would also need to cause a 10.35% dip. So the planet's area must be 10.35% of the star's area.

Wait, because when the planet transits, it blocks (R_planet/R_star)^2 of the star's light. So if (R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.10355, then R_planet/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: when a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2. So the fractional change is (R_p/R_s)^2.

In the case of the spots, the fractional change in flux is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = f [1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ].

Wait, f is 0.2 and (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.482253. So 1- that is about 0.51775. Multiply by 0.2 gives 0.10355, which is ~10.355%.

So the planet's fractional area is 10.355%, so R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is the closest.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and equate it to the flux change caused by a transiting planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots: Cover 20% of the star's surface (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Change Due to Spots**:
   The total flux from the star is proportional to the sum of contributions from the unspotted and spotted regions:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 \left[ (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right],
   \]
   where \( F_0 \) is the flux when the star is unspotted.

   The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:
   \[
   \frac{F_{\text{spotted}} - F_0}{F_0} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right].
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( f = 0.2 \),
   - \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \),
   - \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).

   Compute \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253.
   \]

   Then:
   \[
   \frac{F_{\text{spotted}} - F_0}{F_0} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.482253 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.517747 \approx 0.10355.
   \]

   This means the fractional change in flux is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

4. **Flux Change Due to a Transiting Planet**:
   The fractional change in flux caused by a transiting planet is:
   \[
   A_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
   \]

   To match the amplitude of the spotted star, set:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
   \]

   Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
