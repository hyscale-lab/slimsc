Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms depends on temperature because of something called the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of particles in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as N1 and in star_2 as N2. So N1 is twice N2, meaning N1 = 2 N2.

The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but actually the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's a property of the iron atom, right? So ΔE is the same for both star_1 and star_2.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is N = N0 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where N0 is the number of atoms in the lower energy level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. So the ratio N1/N2 would be [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) multiplied by some factors... Wait, wait, no, because N0 might not be the same in both stars. Oh wait, but if the photosphere is in LTE, the ratio of the excited states would depend on their respective temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using the ratio of the populations. So, the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star 1 to star 2 is 2. So N1/N2 = 2.

But N1 = N0,1 * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly N2 = N0,2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So N1/N2 = (N0,1 / N0,2) * exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ).

Wait, that's a bit complicated. But perhaps the number of atoms in the lower level (N0) could be the same for both stars? Or maybe not, but since the problem doesn't give any information about the number of atoms, perhaps we can assume that the ratio N0,1/N
