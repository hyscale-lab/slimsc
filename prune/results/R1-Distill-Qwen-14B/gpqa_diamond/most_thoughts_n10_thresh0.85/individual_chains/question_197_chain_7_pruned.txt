Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by looking at the given data: IR and NMR spectra, and the reaction conditions.

First, the IR data. The peaks are 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which I think indicates an -OH stretch because that region usually corresponds to O-H vibrations. But wait, the strong peak at around 1720 cm-1 might suggest a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, maybe there's an aromatic ring with some substituents, and a carbonyl group, possibly an acid or ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data next. The peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because that's a typical region for such protons. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, like two sets of doublets which would happen if there are two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring. So that's probably a para-substituted benzene, maybe like p-methyl something? But wait, I'll get back to that.

The other signals are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So let's break those down. The 0.9 ppm triplet is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H could be a CH(CH3)2 group or something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else, like maybe a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H suggests maybe a methine (CH) group that's near some substituents. The 1.7 ppm for 2H could be another CH2. So putting it all together, perhaps there's a chain attached to the ring. Let's think about the structure.

So, the aromatic protons: two doublets, which suggests substitution in the para position. So maybe the benzene has two substituents opposite each other. One substituent is a methyl group (since in the NMR, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably a CH2CH3, but wait, maybe it's part of a larger chain attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and something else. Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, probably a carboxylic acid proton. So that suggests the compound has a -COOH group attached to the ring. So the ring would have a COOH group in one position and another group in the para position.

So putting that together, the structure could be something like a para-substituted benzoic acid. But where is the other substituent? Let's see the NMR. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H. That's a CH3 group attached to something. If it's a CH2CH(CH3) group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the chain is like CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe it's a branching. Let me think about the possible structure. So the benzoic acid would be at one position, and the other substituent is an isobutyl or something similar.

Wait, looking at the NMR again: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). So maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a branching like a isobutyl group. Because the triplet at 0.9 suggests a CH2CH3, so maybe that's at the end of a chain. Let's try to reconstruct the structure.

The substituent on the benzene ring (other than COOH) would be a group that's attached to the ring. Let's say the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H could be from a CH2 group next to a CH. The 2.9 ppm is a CH that's next to another CH2. So perhaps the structure is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR also has a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H). A doublet for 3H would suggest that these protons are attached to a CH3 group that's next to a CH. So maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, that would give a CH(CH3)2 group. Let me think: if the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch. Let's try to draw this out.

The substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a tertiary structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, which would make it a pentyl group? Wait, but the NMR doesn't add up to that. Let me count the number of protons.

Wait, the substituent has a chain with 3H as a triplet (0.9 ppm) which is probably a CH2CH3 group. So that's the end of the chain. Then, moving up, the next part is a CH2 group (maybe 1.7 ppm), then a CH group (2.9 ppm), and then a CH3 group (1.4 ppm, doublet). So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the substituent as a branch. The substituent could be a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Let me see:

So, the substituent is attached to the ring as a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group. So the substituents are at para positions.

Wait, but let me check the NMR for that. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. The sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the NMR for that substituent would have the CH(CH2CH3) group. Let's see:

The -CH2- group attached to the ring would have protons that are split based on neighboring groups. The CH group next to the ring would have two neighboring protons (from the CH2 and the CH2CH3). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. Wait, an isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that's not correct because isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, which would have a central CH attached to two CH3 groups and a CH2 connected to the ring.

Wait, no, isobutyl is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, wait, correction: The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, maybe I should clarify.

The isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-? No, wait, no. The correct structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me correct this. The isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the isobutyl group is (CH2)2CHCH3? No. Wait, the isobutyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the branching is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH3)2? Actually, wait, maybe I should think of it as:

Isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not correct. The correct isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, wait, no. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let's think of butane: CH3CH2CH2CH3. The
