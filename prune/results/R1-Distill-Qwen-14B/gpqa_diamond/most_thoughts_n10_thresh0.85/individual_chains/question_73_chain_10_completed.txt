Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I think I need to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. There's that velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u'v)/(c²)), but wait, I might have that mixed up. Or is it (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)) when they're moving in the same direction? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

In this case, both are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but considering relativity. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the speed of one object as observed in the other's frame. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction as A, from the lab frame. What is the speed of B as seen from A's frame?

The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) when v is the velocity of B and u is the velocity of A. Or wait, no, it's (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)), but if in the lab frame, A is moving at u = 0.6c and B is at v = 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ?

Wait, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) → (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. So the magnitude would be 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. That seems familiar. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

So looking at the options, the relative speed options are either 0.1c, 0.14c, or 1.1c. So options B, C, D have 0.14c or 0.1c. So that narrows it down.

Next, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both astronauts and sum them up.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 → 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² → 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1 / sqrt(0.75) → approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² → 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 → 2.5 + 3.464 = ~5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the correct pair is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the relative speed the other way. Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, same direction. So the relative speed from the first astronaut's perspective is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, yes, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3 ) → -0.1/0.7 c → approximately -0.1428c, so the magnitude is 0.1428c ≈ 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the options: option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower.

Wait, wait. Did I compute the energies correctly?

E1: 2m * gamma where gamma is 1.25 → 2.5 m c².

E2: 3m * gamma where gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75) → sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547 → 3m * 1.1547 → 3.464 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which is 5.96 mc² when rounded to two decimal places. So option C is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) (mass \(2m\)) and \(v_B = 0.5c\) (mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The magnitude of the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
