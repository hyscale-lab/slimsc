Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these titration concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll work through each part.

First, I think I need to calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the moles of solute stay the same, but the volume increases. So, initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. Let's see:

Moles before dilution = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume, which is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025, right? So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, oh wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. Volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So let's find out how much NaOH is added at that point.

First, the equivalence point: the moles of NaOH needed to neutralize all the acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of this volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L.

Now, let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted is 0.00025.

So the initial moles in the solution were 0.001 (from the diluted solution). After reacting 0.00025, the remaining moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Also, the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted volume plus the added NaOH. So initial was 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ makes it 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's compute that. 0.00075 divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but I can also use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = let's calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait, wait. No, no. pKa = -log(Ka), so Ka is 1.85e-5. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, I think. Let me confirm with a calculator: 1.85e-5 has log(1.85)=0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So for the 25% titration point, the moles of A^- and HA are 0.00025 and 0.00075, respectively. But the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option D's first value is 4.57, which is higher than our calculation here of around 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. That's correct. Then, when you add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 moles, yes.

At this point, the solution has:

moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075

moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M

So the ratio is (0.005882) / (0.017647) = 0.333333, which is 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477, so pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So the pH is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and then 8.52 as the equivalence point. Option D is 4.57 for the first part.

Wait, but wait. Wait, might I have missed something in the calculations?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual H+ concentration using the Henderson equation more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculations.

Wait another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the concentration reduces, which would lower the pH compared to the original concentration. But wait, the initial diluted solution's pH can be found, but that's not what the first part is. The first part is at 25% titration.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately.

Wait, the Henderson equation gives pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Since [A-]/[HA] is 1/3, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is approximately 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Now, moving to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid present initially. So moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles, as we calculated earlier. The total volume is the initial solution plus the NaOH added. Initial solution was 40 cm³, NaOH added is 10 cm³ (as it takes 10 cm³ to reach equivalence), so total volume is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the equilibrium expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. Because log(3.288) is about 0.517, so 5.517? Wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 × 10^-6. So log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483. Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, which is approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, which matches our calculations. So the first pH (25% titration) is 4.26 and the equivalence is 8.52. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but let me check whether I made any mistakes in the calculations.

Hmm. Let me double-check the equivalence point. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, which is correct because 0.001 moles in 0.05 L. Kb is correct, 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The calculation of x: x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → sqrt is about 3.288e-6, correct. Then pOH is about 5.483, pH is 8.517. So yes, 8.52.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The total moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001, so 25% of this is:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are equal to the moles of NaOH added:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.020}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
