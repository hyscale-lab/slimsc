Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to walk through it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes, right? So it's a reaction where a ketone (like R2CO) becomes R2CH2. So if the starting material has a ketone group, after this reaction, it would lose the oxygen and form CH2.

Now, looking at the data given for Compound X: there's IR and NMR. Let's break that down.

First, the IR data: strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region is probably O-H stretches, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait. The IR also has peaks at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak that often indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or aldehyde. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings, like C=C stretching.

So, considering the IR, it's possible that Compound X has a ketone group and an aromatic ring. The broad IR peak could be from an -OH group, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would have a strong O-H around 3000 cm-1 and a carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the O-H would be broad around 3400. But wait, the IR here has 3400-2500, which is a broad region—could be O-H from a carboxylic acid or maybe an -OH from an alcohol. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a really high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Oh wait, but wait, 10.5 is even higher. Alternatively, that could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid's -OH. Because carboxylic acid -OH protons are typically around 10-12 ppm as broad signals. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: if it's a carboxylic acid, then in the IR, the carbonyl would be around 1700, which matches the 1720 peak. So, maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative?

So, the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak (bs, 1H) which could be the -COOH proton. Then, the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring because the two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, like in a para-disubstituted benzene. So, maybe the ring has two substituents opposite each other.

The next peak is 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Hmm, that's a multiplet. Maybe that's a CH group next to some substituents. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be two protons attached to adjacent carbons. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests a CH2CH3 group, maybe a methyl at the end of a chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) could be a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a quaternary carbon.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring has substituents. Let me think about the possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a methyl group and a substituent that's a ketone or something else. Wait, but if it's a benzoic acid, that would have a COOH group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700, but maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a broad singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit, but let me think about other possibilities. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm. So a triplet in the IR for 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, but let's try to build the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions: one is a methyl (based on the NMR peaks), and the other is a group that's connected to a chain.

Let's think about the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (2H): that's probably a para-substituted benzene. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position that's an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the ring protons would split into two doublets. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, the NMR would have a CH2 or CH group adjacent to
