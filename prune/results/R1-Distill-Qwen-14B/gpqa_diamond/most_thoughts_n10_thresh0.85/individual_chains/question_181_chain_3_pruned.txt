Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain branch of the proton-proton chain stops. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of the flux between two energy bands. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has a few branches. The pp-III branch is one of them. Neutrinos are produced in these reactions, right? Specifically, the pp-III branch produces electron neutrinos (Î½e) via the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-4 nuclei and emits a neutrino.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the neutrino production in the core would take about that time to affect the flux we detect here. But since the pp-III stopped, the neutrino flux should change as well.

But what neutrinos are we talking about? The question specifies two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, these are the energies of the neutrinos. I need to find the ratio of their fluxes.

I think the key here is understanding which part of the pp chain produces neutrinos in each band. The main neutrino emission in the Sun comes from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which produces 700-800 keV neutrinos. Oh wait, but wait, another part of the pp chain produces higher energy neutrinos? Or is it the same reaction?

Wait, the pp-III branch is also involved in neutrino production. The pp-III branch produces a boron-8 nucleus, which then decays into two helium-4s and emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 15-16 keV. Oh wait, that's way lower than the bands given. So maybe that's not the main source for the higher keV bands?

Wait, no, wait. The neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 are in the 700-800 keV range. These are called the 7Be neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stopped, would that affect the production of 7Be? Because the pp-III is part of the chain that leads to 7Be production.

Let me think. The proton-proton chain has several steps. The main pp-I branch produces two protons into deuterium, then into helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III branches involve more steps, like producing boron-8 or other isotopes.

Wait, the pp-III branch is when two protons combine to form a diproton, which then emits two positrons and two neutrinos to become helium-4. But wait, that's more like the pp-I branch. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the pp-III branch involves steps that lead to other isotopes, like carbon-12 or boron-8.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch produces boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, each emitting a neutrino. So the neutrinos from B-8 decay are in the ~16 keV range, which is lower than the bands given in the question. So if the pp-III branch stopped, those lower-energy neutrinos would decrease, but what about the higher energy ones?

The higher energy neutrinos (like in the 700-800 keV range) come from the decay of 7Be. Oh, wait, where does 7Be come from? Let me think. The pp-III branch might produce some 7Be. Or maybe another branch.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify the Sun's neutrino production. There are a few main sources: the dominant is the pp chain producing 7Be neutrinos, and then the CNO cycle, but I think the CNO contributes less to the solar neutrinos. Also, the boron-8 decay gives the lower energy neutrinos.

So, the pp chain's main path (pp-I) leads to the production of deuterium, then helium. But in one of the steps, like maybe in the pp-III branch, you can get 7Be. So if the pp-III stopped, how would that affect the production of 7Be?

Wait, I think the production of 7Be in the sun comes from the reactions in the pp chain. The main path is that protons combine into helium, but in certain steps, they form beryllium isotopes. For example, in the pp-III branch, a proton captures a proton to form a diproton, which then decays into two positrons and two neutrinos, giving helium-4. But I'm not sure how that ties into 7Be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7Be is formed in the pp chain via a different branch.
