Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it's deprotonating something to form an enolate, which then attacks the electrophilic carbon in a Michael addition.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It has two ester groups, so the alpha carbon is activated for deprotonation. When the base (NaOEt) abstracts a proton from the malonate, it forms an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate because the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, making it a good Michael acceptor.

The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2CH2? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. Here, the substituent is at the gamma position. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached somewhere. Wait no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. So that would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would imply that the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the same as the alpha to the carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3. That would make the substituent on the double bond. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CO-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH- group connected to CO-OCH3 and a p-tolyl group. Wait, maybe it's actually CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O
