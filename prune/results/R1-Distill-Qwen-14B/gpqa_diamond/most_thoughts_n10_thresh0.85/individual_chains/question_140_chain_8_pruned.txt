Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll take it slow and think through each part.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius, maybe. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope in one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's list out the clues:

1. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably a compound that has an element with isotopes, like maybe something with chlorine or another element that commonly has stable isotopes.

2. Reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions with liquids; maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid, like magnesium or sodium with water or acid. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Another possibility is a reaction like a Grignard reagent reacting, but Grignards are usually in diethyl ether or THF. Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2O2? Or perhaps X is a heavier isotope version of something else, like D2O (deuterated water), but that's a stretch.

Wait, the product of X with a keto acid has a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. Keto acids are like ketones with carboxylic acid groups. Oh, wait, when a ketone reacts with something like LiAlH4, it gets reduced. Wait, but substance X is reacting with a keto acid. Maybe X is a reducing agent?

Wait, looking back: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. So the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: if the keto acid is, say, cyclohexanone carboxylic acid, and X is a reducing agent like LiAlH4, but wait, LiAlH4 is usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Substances that can deprotonate or reduce? Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that adds H or something. Wait, maybe X is something like NaBH4 or LiAlH4, which are strong reducing agents.

Wait, but the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. So the starting keto acid (like RCO-R-COOH?) Maybe when reduced, the carbonyl becomes CH2, so perhaps the product would have an OH group. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like D2O, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction with Y.

The first part: X reacts with Y to form gas W. Gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, let's think about possible gases. H2O? No, because H has 0 neutrons, O has 8, so W would have 8+2=10. Not equal. CO2: C has 6, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 =22 protons, 12 (C) + 16*2 =44 neutrons. No, not equal.

Wait, maybe the gas is NH3? No, because NH3 has 14 (N) and 3 H's. Protons: 14 (N) +3 =17. Neutrons: N is 7 (since 14-7=7), and H has 0. So total neutrons 7. 17 protons, 7 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm.

What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4 H =10. Neutrons: C is 6 (since 12-6=6), H is 0. So 6. 10 and 6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like O2? O2 has 16 each. So protons: 16 *2=32. Neutrons: 8 (each O has 8 neutrons, 16-8=8). So 32 protons, 16*2=32 neutrons. Wait, no, O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. O2 has 16 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons (since O-16 is the most common isotope). So total neutrons in O2 is 8 *2=16. So 16 protons, 16 neutrons. That fits! So gas W is O2? Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so that's possible.

Wait, but wait: what if the gas is something like CH4? No, didn't fit. Or maybe CO? C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So 6+8=14. So protons:14, neutrons:14. Oh wait, that's another possibility! So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's a match. So the gas could be carbon monoxide.

But wait, how would that form? Let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce CO. Hmm.

Alternatively, the gas could be something like H2, but H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (for H), so 2 and 0. Not equal. Or maybe Ne (neon), but that's a noble gas. Not sure.

Wait, another option: maybe the gas is C2H2 (acetylene)? No, that's 2 C (12) and 2 H, so protons: 12*2 + 2 =26. Neutrons: C has 6 each, so 6*2=12, H is 0. 12. 26 and 12, not equal.

Wait, maybe the gas is NO. Nitric oxide. N has 7, O has 8. So NO has 15 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (since 14-7=7), O has 8. So 15. Wait, 15 protons, 15 neutrons. So that's a match.

So, possible W is NO. Because 15 protons and 15 neutrons.

But how would that form? Let me think: the reaction of X with Y gives NO. Also, Y is a liquid. Hmm. What liquids react to form NO? Maybe a reaction involving nitric acid and something else? Or perhaps Y is water, and X is some compound that when reacts with water produces NO.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should approach this differently.

The precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is approximately 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above the freezing point of water (which is 273 K or 0 degrees C). So B is a solid at normal temperatures, but just barely. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like paraffin wax, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of hydrocarbon or another organic compound.

Wait, another thought: melting points around 4°C could be something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a basic carbonate or something else.

Wait, but let's think about the product of X and a keto acid. Let's say X is a reducing agent. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, which is a compound with a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, like perhaps cyclohexanone carboxylic acid.

Wait, when a keto acid (RCO-R-COOH) is treated with a reducing agent like LiAlH4, the ketone group (RCO-) is reduced to RCH2O-. But wait, would that form an alcohol and a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is something that can deprotonate the keto acid. Or perhaps X is a base, but that might not fit.

Wait, the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an alcohol with two OH groups? Or something else.

Let's think about the possible structure. Suppose the keto acid is something like benzophenone acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium or magnesium, but that seems unrelated. Wait, but if X is sodium, which is a metal, reacting with a liquid Y (maybe water or an acid) would produce H2 gas, but earlier thoughts didn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should look at the options given for the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. These are fairly small numbers, so perhaps the elements are light.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all instances. So if X has two elements, say Cl and H, then the lightest would be H (1) and heaviest Cl (35), sum is 36. But the options don't have 36. Hmm.

Wait, but if X has, say, Cl and another element like Na, but that's not matching other info. Alternatively, maybe X has O and another element.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. Let me think, what if X is H2O2, which is hydrogen peroxide. H2O2 would have O and H. The isotopes: perhaps in X, one of the O is a heavier isotope like O-18. But H2O2 is a liquid, and when it reacts with another liquid Y, what could that be?

Wait, but the reaction between H2O2 and, say, a metal would produce H2 gas. But earlier, we thought that H2 doesn't fit the W description. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O, deuterated water. When D2O reacts with something, but what? Maybe a metal, like Mg or Na, but that's a violent reaction.

Wait, but if X is Na, which reacts with water (Y) to produce H2 (W), but H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. No.

Wait, let me think back to the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and B. But B has a melting point of about 4°C. Hmm, not sure.

Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's think about the keto acid. For example, if the keto acid is acetone with a carboxylic group, like maybe something like (CH3)2COOH. But when reduced, that would form (CH3)2CHOH, which has two OH groups. But how does that
