Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4Â°C, I think. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. Wait, same number of protons and neutrons per molecule? Or per atom? Because if the molecule consists of atoms with same number of protons and neutrons, then each atom would have that property. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think.

Wait, but the wording says "the same number of neutrons and protons". So each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if the molecule is H2O, that's not the case. Wait, but maybe it's something like O2 or N2, but no. Or perhaps it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, let's think about possible gases.

Wait, gas W could be something like CO2. Let's see: CO2 has one C and two O atoms. C has atomic number 6, so 6 protons. O has 8. Each CO2 molecule would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons, and the neutrons would be based on natural abundance. Hmm, but maybe another approach.

Wait, another possibility: gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Let's consider possible gases. Could it be O2? O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in the most common isotope). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, the total protons would be 16, neutrons 16. So same number. So W could be O2. But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas. But when you have reactions, sometimes O2 is a product. Alternatively, it could be H2, but H has 1 proton and 0 or 1 neutrons (depending on isotope). But if it's H2, each molecule has 2 protons and 0 or 2 neutrons. That wouldn't match the same number unless it's deuterium (heavy hydrogen), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO, but CO has 29 protons (C=6, O=8; 6+8=14 per molecule, but wait, CO has one C and one O. So 6+8=14 protons, and the number of neutrons would be (6-6)+(8-8)=0? No, that's not right. Wait, each atom's neutrons: C usually
