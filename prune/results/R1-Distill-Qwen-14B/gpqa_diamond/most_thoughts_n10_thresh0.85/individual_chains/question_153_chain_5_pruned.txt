Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is likely the enolate ion from dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a strong enolate under basic conditions.

So, the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which has two methyl groups and two ester groups) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group at the alpha position, right? So when the enolate attacks, the new bond forms at the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, but the structure of the acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that. The structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon (the CH2 is actually CH-p-tolyl? Hmm, wait, maybe I got that wrong. The structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Wait no, the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-p-tolyl? Maybe not. Let me think again. The formula is probably CH2=C(-OOCR)-R', where R' is p-tolyl. Oh wait, no, the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, right? Because the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me visualize: for acrylate, the structure is CH2=CHCOOR. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents would be on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps the acrylate is CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl. No, I think more accurately, it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. That would make the structure (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=C(p-tol
