Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually undergo nucleophilic addition. So, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When a ketone like that reacts with NaCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. Then the oxygen would get a negative charge, which could pick up a proton. So the product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is on the second carbon, which is connected to two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, that makes sense because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So after adding CN-, the product would have (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's correct.

Now, what's the role of reagent A here? I remember that in the formation of cyanohydrins, the reaction is typically acid-catalyzed. So maybe A is an acid. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But isn't the formation of cyanohydrin done under acidic conditions? So maybe A is H3O+.

Wait, but if A is NaHSO3, perhaps the sulfur is involved somehow. But I think NaHSO3 is more commonly used as a source of H+ and bisulfite ions, maybe in other reactions like the reduction of carbonyl groups, but not for this. Or perhaps, in some cases, it's part of a milder acid condition.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone reacts with cyanide, under basic conditions, the reaction might not proceed. So it's usually done in an acidic environment. So A is an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while options C and D have NaHSO3.

So the first reaction's reagent A is likely H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Wait, but the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Wait, in this molecule, the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So structure-wise, it's something like (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)CN, where Ph is
