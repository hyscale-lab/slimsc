Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection method used is the radial velocity (RV) method.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. They tell me that the spectral line shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves toward and away from us because of the planet's gravitational pull, causing the spectral lines to shift. The amplitude of this shift (the velocity semi-amplitude) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 day) * (P)^(1/3) * c )

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Another formula I recall is K = (v) where v is the velocity semi-amplitude. The velocity semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and other factors.

Wait, here's another approach. The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, which is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K (velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Or wait, let me think more clearly.

The RV method measures the star's velocity change. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i
