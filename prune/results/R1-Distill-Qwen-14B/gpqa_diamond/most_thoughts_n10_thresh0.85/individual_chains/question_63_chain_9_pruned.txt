Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum models of diatomic molecules. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait. The options are all different momenta values, given in N*s. So I need to find the photon's momentum that's just right for this transition.

First, I should recall what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which in the rotation-vibration model would correspond to the ground state of both rotation and vibration. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the ground state is the lowest rotational state (J=0) and the vibrational ground state (n=0). So in this case, the molecule is in the (J=0, n=0) state.

But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so the next state after (J=0, n=0) would be either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. Which one is lower in energy?

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, I think the rotational energy levels are quantized as well. So the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is given by (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. And the vibrational energy is (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia isn't constant because the bond length can change. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem says "non-rigid rotor model," but maybe it's assuming the bond length isn't changing so much that the model is still approximated as a rigid rotor. Or perhaps the key here is the vibrational transition.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (n=0, J=0). The next possible state with the lowest energy would probably be the first excited state. But what's the next lowest? Because rotation and vibration have different energy spacings.

The vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which is usually a larger energy difference compared to rotational energy levels, which depend on J(J+1). Let me think. For example, the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is (J=1: 2 ħ²/(2I) ), so it's (2 - 0.5) ħω? Wait, no, wait. The vibrational energy is based on n, while rotational on J. So the spacing for vibration is ħω, and for rotation, the spacing between J and J+1 is something else.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the energy required for both possible transitions: one where n increases by 1 (vibrational excitation) and another where J increases by 1 (rotational excitation). Then pick the one with the lower energy, because the question asks for the photon with
