Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about stars with and without dark spots affecting the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall brightness and temperature, but how does that relate to the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere?

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but spots are cooler, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the photosphere decreases.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So we're looking for the factor by which this ratio changes. Without spots versus with spots.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the ratio in question is n1/n2, right? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, making the ratio lower. Without spots, higher Teff would make the ratio higher.

Wait, let me think about it. The ratio n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). If the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means n2/n1 is increasing when Teff is lower. That seems counterintuitive. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, when T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a smaller negative number, so exp() becomes larger. So n2/n1 increases when T increases. So the ratio n1/n2 decreases with higher T. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K without spots, and 5500
