Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I divide the parallax into small ranges, how does the count of stars in each range change as the parallax (plx) changes.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the density of stars is uniform in space, so the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But since we're dealing with parallax, which relates to distance, I need to find how the number of stars in a certain parallax range depends on plx.

Let me think about the volume of space corresponding to a certain range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So for a small change in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance?

If plx is small (which means distance is large), a change in plx would correspond to a certain volume. So the number of stars in that volume would depend on that volume.

Wait, I think the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars N is proportional to d² dd, assuming uniform density.

Since d = 1/plx, substituting that in. So N = k * (1/plx)^2 * (dplx) where k is some constant. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so let's see.

Wait, the number per unit plx would be the derivative of N with respect to plx. Because for a small change dplx, the number is N = k d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

N = k * (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx^2 ) dplx )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitude, maybe I should take absolute values or just think about the positive change.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of plx. So volume is 4π d² dd, and since d = 1/plx, then d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx). But since we're considering the number of stars, it's positive, so N = 4π k (1/plx^4) (dplx) )? Wait, no, because the volume element is dV = 4π d² dd. So when you express dd in terms of dplx, you get dV = 4π d² ( - (1/plx²) dplx ), but plx is 1/d, so plx = d^-1 → d = plx^-1.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The volume of the spherical shell between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So substituting d in terms of plx:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

Which is 4π (-1/plx^4) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the volume is a positive quantity. So the volume element is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform density. So N = (some constant) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So per unit plx, N per dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again.

Another approach: Let's think about the density of stars in 3D space. If they are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So N = density * volume.

The volume between distances d and d+dd is 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, dd = -d^2 dplx → because plx = 1/d → dplxd = - (1/d²) dd.

Wait, let me do the substitution step by step.

d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

Then, d(plx) = derivative of plx with respect to d is -1/d². So dplx = (-1/d²) dd.

So, substituting into the volume:

Volume = 4π d² dd = 4π d² ( - d^2 dplx )

Because dd = - (1/d²) dplx → dd = - d^2 dplx.

So Volume = 4π d² * (-d² dplx) = -4π d^4 dplx.

But d = 1/plx → Volume = -4π (1/plx)^4 dplx.

But since volume is positive, we can write Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, N = (number density) * Volume → N = k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So for a small range dplx in parallax, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought option B was 1/plx^2. So why am I getting 1/plx
