Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let's break it down.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution before titration. Because when we mix two volumes, the concentration changes. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2.

The original solution is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 *0.05? Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. When we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will produce acetate ions and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Now, the question is about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let me handle them one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters). The diluted solution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH needed is calculated by moles / concentration. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, that's 10 cm³. But wait, the initial volume of the solution is 40 cm³. So when we add 10 cm³ NaOH, the total volume becomes 50 cm³.

At equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+). Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Given Ka
