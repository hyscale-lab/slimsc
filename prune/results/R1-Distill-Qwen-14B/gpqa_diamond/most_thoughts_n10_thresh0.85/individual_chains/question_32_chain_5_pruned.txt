Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So the nucleus would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is ⁶Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. I remember that for speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are significant. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations.

The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but sometimes people confuse kinetic energy with total energy. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the kinetic energy provided to the ion. Or does it? No, wait, RHIC accelerates ions to high speeds, and the energy they have when moving at that speed is their total energy. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think in accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, in particle physics, when you talk about the energy of an accelerated particle, it's usually the kinetic energy. But in relativity, the total energy is gamma * m c², which includes rest mass plus kinetic. So which one is the question asking for? The question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So the energy needed to reach that speed. So perhaps it's the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy.

Wait, in accelerator physics, the energy is typically the kinetic energy. Because when you accelerate a particle, you're giving it kinetic energy. So I think the question is asking for the kinetic energy, K.E., which is (gamma - 1) * m c².

But I'm not 100% certain. Let me proceed and see.

So first, I need to calculate gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's plug in v = 0.96c.

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma = 1 / 0.28. Let's compute that: 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is 0.99999, so yes.

But let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 is 7/25. So 1 / (7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857...

So gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is ⁶Li, so it's a lithium-6 nucleus. The mass can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately... I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to make an approximation.

Wait, the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for a nucleus with A nucleons, the
