Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two planets around two stars, both stars have the same mass as our Sun. Each planet has a mass similar to Neptune, which I think is less than Jupiter but more than Earth. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that's good because it might simplify the calculations.

The key data points: 
- Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms.
- Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.
- We're asked how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, causing the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. 

The formula I think is involved here is the one for the semi-amplitude of the RV signal. The formula is something like:
K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( (1) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (1) ) ) 

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Let me think again. I think the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

But wait, since M_p is much less than M_star (like Neptune is about 17 Earth masses, but the star is like 333,000 Earth masses), so M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Similarly, (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1.

So maybe I can simplify the formula. Let me look up the simplified version. Oh right, the formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is approximately:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) * (year) ) ) ) * ( ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But wait, I might be mixing variables. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, I remember that for the same star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, all else being equal. Because K depends on (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) ), something like that.

Wait, the formula is actually: K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since e is zero because the orbits are circular, that term is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me get the exact formula. From what I recall, the RV semi-amplitude K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. I think the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But given that M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So:

K ≈ (2 pi G / (c^3 P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since both planets
