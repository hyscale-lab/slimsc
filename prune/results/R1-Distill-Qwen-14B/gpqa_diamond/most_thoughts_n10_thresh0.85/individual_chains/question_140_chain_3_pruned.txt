Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Additionally, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Also, Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is known too.

The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, okay, let's start dissecting each part.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X and the other substances are. Let's go through each clue.

1. **Reaction of X with Y:**
   - Violently reacts with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Or another liquid like alcohol? Wait, but water is a common one. If X is something reactive, like a strong base or an acid.

2. **Gas W:**
   - W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons would be the same. Each atom in W must satisfy that. Wait, but a molecule can have multiple atoms. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a single atom? Because if it's a molecule like H2O, the protons and neutrons would add up differently.

Wait, no. Let's think about what elements have equal protons and neutrons. For example, deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Or, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But if W is a gas, maybe it's H2 or another diatomic gas. Let me think: H2 as a molecule would have each H as 1 proton. So for each H, 1 neutron (since it's the lightest isotope). So each H has 1 neutron, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, that would make the total protons (2) equal to total neutrons (2). So yes, H2 could be W. But wait, under what conditions? If X reacts with Y to produce H2, then Y might be something like H2O (but that's a liquid), but if X is a metal reacting with acid to produce H2 gas. Like Mg reacting with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat.

Wait, but the reaction is violent, so maybe a more vigorous reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a reactive metal.

But let's think further. The precipitate G is formed. So when X reacts with Y, a solid precipitate forms. If Y is a solution, perhaps a salt solution, and X is a metal that forms a precipitate.

Wait, another thought: if Y is water, and X is sodium or another alkali metal. But sodium reacting with water is violent, produces H2 gas, and maybe forms NaOH (which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, but that doesn't fit with the precipitate G.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Let's say Y is H2SO4, a liquid. If X is a metal like zinc, when they react, H2 is released, and the precipitate could be zinc sulfate? No, that's soluble. Hmm, maybe if X is a metal and Y is a salt solution, leading to a double displacement reaction, producing a precipitate.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so room temperature. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that's higher. Or perhaps water ice? No, water freezes at 273 K (which is 0°C), so 277 K is just a bit above 4°C. Wait, but water's melting point is 273 K. So if B is something that's solid at 277 K, but if the melting point is around that, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. So B is a solid at that temperature, or maybe it's a solid that starts to melt around that point. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that's just starting to melt. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. So G is perhaps a compound that decomposes upon heating to produce B. For example, perhaps G is a carbonate which, when heated, produces CO2 and a metal oxide. Or maybe a hydroxide decomposing into metal oxide and water.

Wait, but let me think about the product of X and a keto acid. The product contains two oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid (which usually has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, like a beta-keto acid), the product has two oxygens. So perhaps X is adding something to the acid, like in a condensation reaction. Or maybe X is a base that neutralizes the acid, but I'm not sure.

Another point: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably a molecule that has an isotope substitution. For example, maybe X is deuterated, like D2O or something else.

Wait, combining all this. Let's suppose X is a strong base, like NaOH, but that doesn't have isotopes. Or perhaps X is something like CH3OH, but that's an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe X is H2O, but it's more likely a heavier isotope, like D2O. But then, when D2O reacts with a liquid Y, what happens?

Alternatively, maybe X is a hydride. Wait, another angle: when W is the gas, which has equal protons and neutrons. So each molecule of W has n protons and n neutrons. So for a molecule like D2 (deuterium gas), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That would fit. So W is D2, which is heavy hydrogen gas. That would mean that Y is probably a compound that when reacts with X (which has D), produces D2 gas.

Wait, but if X is something like NaOD (sodium deuteride), reacting with an acid like HCl, would produce D2 gas? Maybe, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal containing deuterium, and Y is an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal such as sodium, but with a heavy isotope in it. Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for example, sodium normally has 23 protons, with isotopes like 23Na, 24Na, etc. But perhaps X is using a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

Wait, let's think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a structure like O=C-(CH2)n-COOH. If X is something like a base, perhaps it could deprotonate the keto acid, but that would just form a salt. Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds to the keto group, but that's more in the realm of organic chemistry.

Wait, the question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents, which are organometallic compounds like CH3MgBr. Grignard reagents are used to add to carbonyl groups. So perhaps X is a Grignard reagent or similar.

Grignard reagents are typically RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. For example, CH3MgBr. When Grignard reagents react with water, they produce the corresponding hydrocarbon and Mg(OH)Br. So if X is a Grignard reagent, when it reacts with Y (maybe a proton source like water or an acid), it would produce H2 gas (if Y is water). But wait, Grignard reactions are usually done under anhydrous conditions because they react violently with water.

But in the problem, the reaction produces gas
