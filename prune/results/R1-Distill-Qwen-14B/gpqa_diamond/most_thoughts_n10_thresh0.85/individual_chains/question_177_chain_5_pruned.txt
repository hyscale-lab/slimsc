Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature.

Wait, but they also mentioned the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength, which is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, that's a key point. So both stars have the same effective temperature. Because their peak emission wavelengths are the same, right? So T1 equals T2. Oh, that makes sense.

So, given that, the luminosity is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio will be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (1)^4, because T1 = T2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, wait. Because L is proportional to R² T^4, so if T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. But wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So substituting, L1/L2 = (1.5 R2 / R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make L1 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be approximately 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, wait, because maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect the luminosity? Or does it affect the observed wavelength via the Doppler effect? Wait a second, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So perhaps their rest wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Wait, no. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is
