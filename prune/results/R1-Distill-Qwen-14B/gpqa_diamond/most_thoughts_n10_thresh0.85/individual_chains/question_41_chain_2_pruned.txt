Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through it. But what's the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But this is from the rest frame of the medium, right? So when the medium itself is moving, we need to consider the Doppler effect or maybe some sort of velocity addition.

Wait, no, the Doppler effect is more about the frequency or wavelength, not the speed. Oh wait, maybe it's about relativistic velocity addition. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add speeds linearly.

But wait, the speed of light in the medium is already v = c/n. So when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? Let me think about frames of reference.

In the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's speed and the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass.

But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n, right? So when you switch to the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, you have to apply a Lorentz transformation or use the velocity addition formula.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Here, u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, so from the lab frame to the glass frame, the velocity changes. Let me clarify: in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we need to find the light's velocity.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the frames right. The lab is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab frame (let's say the lab is S), the glass (let's say moving frame S') is moving at velocity v.

In S' (glass's frame), the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer, since the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame S, what is the speed of the light?

We can use the velocity addition formula from relativity. The formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²].

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the variables properly.

In the S' frame (glass's rest frame), the light's velocity is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame S. So to find u (the velocity of the light in S), we apply the velocity addition.

So u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/(c²)].

Wait, but u is the velocity of the light in the lab frame. Let's plug in u' = c/n.

So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (1 + (v)/(n c) )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, let's factor out 1/c from denominator:

Wait, 1 + (v)/(n c)
