Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, I've got an organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the NMR coupling pattern for product 3. Hmm, I'll take it step by step.

First, let's start with the initial reaction. The compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH, it forms a light yellow solid product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. That's probably what's happening here. So, the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation, creating an adamantyl structure with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests some kind of protons that are deshielded. Maybe these are the protons adjacent to the new double bond, like vinylic protons. The peaks at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) are likely the adamantane's bridgehead protons because adamantane is a highly branched structure with a lot of equivalent protons in the middle. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another set of equivalent protons, perhaps on a more substituted position.

The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but wait—the first reaction was elimination, which would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh, maybe I misread. So, product 1 after KOH is a diene? Or perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, KOH in such a reaction usually leads to elimination, not epoxidation. Hmm, but then why the IR shows C=O?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines not on adjacent carbons. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. So when treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, but wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with two equivalents of OH-.

Wait, no—when two vicinal bromides are present and treated with a strong base, they could form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxidation requires peracids, not bases. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a double elimination, forming an alkene. But the IR here is 1720 cm^-1, which is more like a ketone or ester. That doesn't fit with an alkene. So maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't from elimination but from some kind of substitution. Wait, KOH is a base and a nucleophile. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, it could cause a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkyne? No, that's usually with metals like Na, not KOH.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxidation requires an oxirane ring, which is formed from a dihalide via an oxidation, but KOH probably isn't the right reagent for that.

Hmm, I think I might be getting stuck here. Let me think again. The IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 is significant. That's a strong carbonyl. So, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where both bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups. But then, the product would have two hydroxyl groups. But then, why the NMR shows peaks that don't look like hydroxyls, since those usually appear as broad peaks around 1-5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, how can that happen? If the dihalide is treated with a base, perhaps an elimination occurs to form an alkene, and then further oxidation or something else, but I don't think KOH would cause that. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but a substitution where both bromides are replaced by something else. But with KOH, substitution would form diols. Then, what would the NMR look like? The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a diol's protons, but diols usually have protons that are around 1-3 ppm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether, but that would require an alcohol elimination, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is an oxide, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Maybe the KOH is causing a Hofmann rearrangement? But that would require an amide, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look at the next steps. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in some elimination or rearrangement reactions. Maybe it's used in the formation of ketones from alkenes via some acid-catalyzed process.

Wait, so product 1 may have an alkene, and when treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization or a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene that forms a cyclic ketone via some electrocyclic reaction. Hmm, not sure.

After that, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond that is cleaved during ozonolysis.

Wait, let's try to piece it together. The initial product 1 has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720), but I'm not sure how that comes from the dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone, and product 2 is something else. Maybe product 1 is a diol, which then, when heated with a Lewis acid, undergoes some dehydration to form an alkene. But then, product 2 would have an alkene.

Wait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the first reaction forms an alkene. So, product 1 is an adamantyl compound with a double bond. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing some acid-catalyzed reaction, like a rearrangement or a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but that's more with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. So, when the dihalide reacts with KOH, it forms an epoxide. Then, product 1 would be the epoxide. But then, IR would show the C-O-C (epoxide) peak, which is around 1250-1050 cm^-1, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, so product 1's IR is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by oxidation?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination with two equivalents of KOH to form a ketone. Wait, when two adjacent dihalides lose two molecules of HX (in this case, HBr), it could form an alkyne. But alkyne IR doesn't have a peak at 1720. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene, but then, IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution with KOH. Wait, if two adjacent bromides are present, perhaps a substitution occurs where each Br is replaced by an O- group, which then could form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a vicinal diol (1,2-diol) under acidic conditions forms a carbonyl. But in this case, product 1 is formed with KOH, a base. So, maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination (two dehydrohalogenations) to form a conjugated diene. Then, when heated with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide, the diene might undergo some reaction, perhaps a [2+2] cycloaddition or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing acid-catalyzed hydration to form a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the NMR for product 1 again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a pair of protons adjacent to an electronegative group, such as oxygen. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in this case, it's shifted higher due to the structure. Alternatively, these could be aldehyde protons, but aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm, so that's unlikely. Or maybe they are part of an ether, but again, the shift doesn't quite fit.

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. How can we get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Ah, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by an oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted to a diol, which then undergoes oxidation to a ketone. But that would require an oxidizing agent like KMnO4 or something else, not just KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to a vicinal diol (1,3-diol?), but then without an oxidizing agent, how does it become a ketone? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgeheads. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons that are not adjacent. So, maybe when KOH is added, each bromide leaves, forming a pair of carbanions or something, but that might not form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each bromide undergoes elimination, but since they are not adjacent, it would form a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 isn't formed from the initial reaction but perhaps from a different pathway.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move forward and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol or something that, upon treatment with a Lewis acid, forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, it loses water to form a double bond (dehydration). So, product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl compounds.

But then, how does product 1 have a carbonyl group, as indicated by IR of 1720 cm^-1?

Wait, perhaps I'm back to square one. Let me think again. Product 1 has a carbonyl group, so perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where two hydroxide ions attack each bromide, leading to a structure with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, those hydroxyl groups could lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, but to get a ketone from a vicinal diol, you would need an acid catalyst, like in the pinacol rearrangement. So, perhaps product 1 is the diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, product 1 is the diol, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a rearrangement to form a ketone. But then, product 2 would have a ketone, which would then be ozonolyzed, but ozonolysis doesn't cleave ketones; it cleaves alkenes.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should instead focus on the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

If product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyls. The NMR of product 3 would then show signals for the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product
