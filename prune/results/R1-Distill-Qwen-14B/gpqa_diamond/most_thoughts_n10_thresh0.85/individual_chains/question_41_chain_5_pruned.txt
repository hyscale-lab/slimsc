Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move relative to each other, you have to consider their velocities in a certain way, maybe using some kind of relativity principles. But wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's not needing special relativity? Or is it?

Let me think. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. Or is it moving in the same direction as the beam?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, noâ€” the beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is in the same direction. Maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Let me try to visualize.

So the lab frame is where the glass is moving. The glass is moving with velocity v. The light is inside the glass, so its speed in the glass is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n relates to the speed of light in the medium as c/n. But wait, wait. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is always c divided by n, regardless of the motion of the medium, right? Or is that only when the medium is stationary? Hmm, that's the thing. I'm a bit
