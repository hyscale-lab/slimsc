Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again. It's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants are involved here.

The given data is: [Co] total is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually denote the formation of complexes. So for each successive SCN- addition, the β increases until a point and then maybe decreases? I'm a bit confused here, but let's think.

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2-n where n is 0,1,2,3,4? Or wait, since Co is +2, adding SCN^- (which is -1 each) would mean each complex has a charge. So Co(SCN)_n would have a charge of 2 - n. Like Co(SCN)_4^2- would be the most stable? Or maybe the highest β is for n=3, β3=63, which is the highest given.

Wait, the stability constant β is given for each complex. How does that work? Oh right, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So for Co(SCN)_n^2−, βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2−.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh, dithiocyanato would be with two SCN groups. So that would be n=2, Co(SCN)_2^0? Because Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- gives neutral, so dithiocyanato would be the CoSCN2^0 complex. Or wait, maybe the blue one is a different complex. Hmm, the question says blue dithiocyanato, which usually refers to the Co(SCN)_2^+ ion, I think. Wait, no, wait. Co^2+ with two SCN^- would have a charge of 0? Because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the blue
