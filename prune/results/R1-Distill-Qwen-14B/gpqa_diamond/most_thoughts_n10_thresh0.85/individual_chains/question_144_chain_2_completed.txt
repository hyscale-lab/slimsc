Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) of a particle depends on its lifetime and velocity. The formula, I think, is something like decay length L = v * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime of the particle.

But wait, the proper lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ. The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime of the particle is inversely proportional to the width. Specifically, τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, wait, but the units can be tricky here. Let me think about the units.

First, I need to compute τ. So Γ is given as 320 MeV. I remember that the natural unit system is often used in particle physics, where ħ = c = 1. But when converting to meters and seconds, I'll have to use ħ and c with their actual values.

So, let me write down the constants. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. And the speed of light c is about 3 × 10^8 m/s.

Wait, but the units for Γ are in MeV. I need to convert them to GeV to match the units of ħ. Oh yes, because 1 GeV = 10^3 MeV. So Γ_X is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems really short, but mesons are short-lived, so maybe that's correct.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. How? Oh, right, using relativistic energy-momentum relations. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass. So the kinetic energy would be E - m c², but since we're in natural units (c=1), E = gamma m.

Wait, in natural units, E = gamma * m. So gamma is E / m. Let's compute that: gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The formula for gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) → v = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)). Let's compute that.

gamma = 6.6667 → gamma squared is about 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. That's pretty close to the speed of light. But wait, let me get more precise with the calculation.

Alternatively, since gamma is so large, maybe I can approximate v ≈ c, but I think for precise calculation, I should use the exact value. Let's compute 1/gamma²: (1.2/8)^2 (since gamma is 8/1.2) → (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So yes, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(391/400) = approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the decay length L = v * τ. Let's compute each part.

v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Multiply them: L ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = let's compute 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.1 (exactly, 2.966 * 2.056875). 2.966 * 2 is about 5.932. 2.966 * 0.056875 is about 0.1683. So total is approximately 6.1003.

So L ≈ 6.1003e-16 meters. Wait, but 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, tau was calculated as 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v is 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiplying them: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875. Let me compute that more accurately.

2 * 2.056875 is 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875: Let's see, 0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875, 0.066 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.1356. Total ≈ 1.9868.

So 4.11375 + 1.9868 ≈ 6.10055.

So L ≈ 6.10055e-16 meters. Hmm. But wait, the options are in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 m.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gave about 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. Did I mess up the units somewhere?

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation of tau. Oh wait, the formula for tau is gamma * (hbar c)/E? Wait no, wait, the lifetime of a particle is given by tau = hbar / (width), but the width is in GeV. Let me get the units right.

Wait, natural units where ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm. Wait, perhaps that's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the relation tau = ħ / (Gamma c^2) ?

Wait, maybe I got the units wrong earlier. Let's think about the units of Gamma. Gamma has units of energy. So when we calculate tau in seconds, using ħ in GeV·s.

Wait, because ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = about 2.056e-24 seconds, which is what I had before.

So that part seems correct. Then, velocity v. Wait, another approach for velocity when given E and m is using beta = v/c = (p c^2)/(E c). Hmm, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so beta is (v/c) = (p c^2)/(E c) = (pc)/(E) * c. Wait, maybe I should use beta = pc/E.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute beta using E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So let's compute p.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So (pc) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So pc ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, beta is (pc)/(E) → (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 0.98875 ≈ 0.9888. So v = 0.9888 c. That matches my earlier calculation. So v ≈ 0.9888 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So that part is correct.

So L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have 6e-16. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of tau? Let me double-check.

Wait, τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32: Let me compute that precisely.

32 × 20 is 640, which is larger than 658.2. So 32 × 20 = 640, 658.2-640=18.2. 18.2 /32 = 0.56875. So 20 + 0.56875 = 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm, that's correct. So then L is about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options are in 1e-15 or 1e-16 m. So 6e-16 is 0.6e-15. So it's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ħ. Let me double-check.

I remember that ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (femto meters). So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. But in units where c=1, it's 197.33 MeV·fm.

But perhaps I should express everything in terms of ħ c.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c is a constant. So perhaps I should compute τ in natural units (fm and inverse GeV) and then convert to meters and seconds.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula for the decay length.

Wait, another formula I remember is the decay length L = (gamma * beta * c * tau) * (ħ c / GeV). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula L = (gamma * beta) * (ħ c) / (m * c^2) ) * something?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (gamma * beta) * (c * tau) )

Wait, I think the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Gamma is E / m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... Yes.

Another thought: perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh wait! That might be the mistake. Because in the problem statement, it says production energy is 8 GeV. But in particle physics, when it says the production energy, is that the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, the problem says "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". Hmm. So sometimes, when people say the energy of a particle, they mean the kinetic energy. But in relativistic terms, the total energy is K + m c². Hmm, but that depends on the context.

Wait, if E_X is the total energy, then gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667 as before. But if E_X is the kinetic energy, then total energy E = K + m c² = 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV. Then, gamma would be E / m = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈7.6667.

Ah, this could change the velocity calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming E is the total energy.

So the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. But in high-energy physics, when they say a particle is produced with energy E, it's more likely to be the total energy, not the kinetic. Because in experiments, the beam energy is the kinetic energy, but the produced particles have their total energies measured. Hmm. Alternatively, it's possible that E is the kinetic energy.

Wait, in the initial approach, I took E as the total energy, which gave a decay length of ~6e-16 m, which isn't an option. The options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.

So perhaps I should consider E as the kinetic energy.

Let me try that.

If E is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy is E_total = K + m c² = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV.

Then, gamma = E_total / m = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈7.6667.

Beta is given by beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) ). Let's compute that.

gamma squared is (7.6667)^2 ≈ 58.7778.

So 1/(gamma^2) ≈ 0.01702.

1 - 0.01702 = 0.98298.

sqrt(0.98298) ≈ 0.99145. So beta ≈ 0.99145.

So v ≈ 0.99145 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.974e8 m/s.

Tau is still ħ / Gamma. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = v * tau = 2.974e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.974 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.974 * 2.056875.

Let me compute:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.974 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate:

1 * 2.056875 = 2.056875

Subtract 0.026 * 2.056875.

0.02 * 2.056875 = 0.0411375

0.006 * 2.056875 = 0.01234125

So 0.026 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.05347875.

So 2.056875 - 0.05347875 ≈ 1.99954.

So 0.974 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.99954.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.99954 ≈6.11329.

So L ≈6.113e-16 m.

Still around 6e-16, but again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the lifetime in natural units and then convert to meters.

Wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using the formula:

L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau

But tau is in seconds. So let me compute c * tau first.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c*tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L = gamma * beta * (c tau) = 7.6667 * 0.99145 * 6.1706e-16 m.

Wait, 7.6667 * 0.99145 ≈ 7.6667 * 0.99145 ≈ let me compute:

7.6667 * 1 =7.6667

But it's 0.99145, so 7.6667 * (1-0.00855) ≈ 7.6667 - 7.6667 *0.00855.

7.6667 *0.00855 ≈ 0.0656.

So 7.6667 - 0.0656 ≈7.6011.

Then, 7.6011 * 6.1706e-16 ≈ 46.62e-16 m = 4.662e-15 m.

Ah, wait, that's about 4.66e-15 m, which is option B or C. Let me check the options.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.66e-15 is not exactly matching any option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Gamma is 7.6667, so gamma squared is (7.6667)^2 = (23/3)^2 = 529/9 = 58.777...

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/58.7778) = sqrt(57.7778/58.7778) ) = sqrt(0.98298) ≈ 0.99144.

So gamma * beta = 7.6667 * 0.99144 ≈ let's compute 7.6667 *0.99144.

7 *0.99144 =6.94008.

0.6667 *0.99144 ≈ 0.66099.

Adding them: 6.94008 + 0.66099 ≈7.60107.

So gamma*beta ≈7.60107.

So c*tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = gamma * beta * c tau = 7.60107 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 7.60107 * 6.170625.

7 *6 =42.

7 *0.170625≈1.194375.

0.60107 *6 ≈3.60642.

0.60107 *0.170625≈0.1025.

Adding all:

42 +1.194375=43.194375

+3.60642=46.800795

+0.1025≈46.9033.

So 46.9033e-16 m =4.69033e-15 m.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.69e-15 m.

Looking at the options, B is 4.0655e-15, C is 5.0223e-15. So 4.69e-15 is close to option B or perhaps another value. Wait, but perhaps my calculation is off because I approximated gamma as 7.6667 when in reality it's 9.2/1.2 = 7.666666...

Wait, perhaps a precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything in natural units and then convert to meters.

Let me try that approach.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma. But in natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So perhaps it's easier to compute tau in inverse GeV, then multiply by c to get meters.

Wait, Gamma is in GeV. So tau in natural units (seconds? No, in natural units, time is in inverse energy units, so GeV^-1.)

Wait, natural unit conversions: 1 GeV^{-1} corresponds to (ħ c / GeV) meters. Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, and 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, let me compute ħ c in GeV·fm. 197.33 MeV fm = 0.19733 GeV fm.

So to get the conversion factor from GeV^{-1} to meters: 1 GeV^{-1} = (ħ c) / (GeV) ) * (1 fm) → 0.19733 GeV fm / 1 GeV ) = 0.19733 fm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about this.

In natural units, 1 (GeV)^{-1} equals (ħ c) / (GeV) ) meters.

Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm = 0.19733 GeV fm.

So 1 GeV^{-1} = (0.19733 GeV fm) / 1 GeV ) → 0.19733 fm.

Wait, no, that would be 0.19733 fm. But 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 0.19733 fm = 0.19733e-15 m.

Wait, so tau is in GeV^{-1}.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but in natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} = 6.582e-25 s. Because ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 1 GeV^{-1} = (6.582e-25 s) / (1 GeV) ), but that's the same as ħ in s·GeV^{-1}.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express tau in GeV^{-1}.

tau = 1 / (Gamma / ħ) → Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so Gamma/ħ = 0.32 / 6.582e-25 GeV / (GeV s) ) → 0.32 / 6.582e-25 s^{-1} → approximately 4.86e24 s^{-1}.

Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I should convert tau from seconds to GeV^{-1}.

Tau = 2.056875e-24 s. Since 1 GeV^{-1} = 6.582e-25 s, so tau in GeV^{-1} is 2.056875e-24 s / (6.582e-25 s/GeV^{-1}) ) = (2.056875e-24) / (6.582e-25) ) GeV^{-1}.

Compute numerator: 2.056875e-24.

Denominator:6.582e-25.

So 2.056875e-24 /6.582e-25 = (2.056875 /6.582) * 10^( (-24) - (-25) ) → (0.3125) * 10^1 = 3.125.

Wait, 2.056875 /6.582 is approximately:

6.582 * 0.3125 = 2.056875.

Yes, because 6.582 * 0.3 = 1.9746, 6.582 *0.0125=0.082275. Sum is 2.056875. So 2.056875/6.582 =0.3125.

So tau = 0.3125 * 10 GeV^{-1} =3.125 GeV^{-1}.

So now, in natural units, L = v * tau.

But v is in terms of c. So beta is v/c, so L = beta c tau.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so L = beta * tau.

But tau is in GeV^{-1}, and beta is unitless. So L in GeV^{-1}.

Then, to convert GeV^{-1} to meters:

1 GeV^{-1} = (ħ c) / GeV ) meters.

As above, ħ c = 0.19733 GeV fm = 0.19733e-15 m.

So 1 GeV^{-1} = (0.19733e-15 m) / GeV * GeV^{-1} )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me restate.

In natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} in meters is:

(ħ c) / (1 GeV) ) = (0.19733 GeV fm) / (1 GeV) ) = 0.19733 fm = 0.19733e-15 m.

So L = beta * tau (in GeV^{-1}) ) * (0.19733e-15 m / GeV^{-1} )

So L = beta * tau * 0.19733e-15 m.

Let me compute this.

Tau is 3.125 GeV^{-1}.

Beta is 0.9887 as before.

So L = 0.9887 *3.125 * 0.19733e-15 m.

Compute 0.9887 *3.125: 3.125 *1=3.125; 3.125 *0.9887 ≈3.125 - 3.125 *0.0113 = approximately 3.125 - 0.0353 ≈3.0897.

Then, 3.0897 *0.19733e-15 ≈ let's compute 3 *0.19733 =0.592 → 0.592e-15.

0.0897 *0.19733 ≈0.0177 → 0.0177e-15.

So total approx 0.6097e-15 m →6.097e-16 m.

Again, about 6.1e-16 m. So that's the same as before.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an assumption mistake. Maybe I should consider E as the kinetic energy, which would change gamma.

Wait, let's try that. If E is the kinetic energy, then E_total is 8+1.2=9.2 GeV.

Gamma is 9.2/1.2≈7.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/(58.7778)) = sqrt(57.7778/58.7778) → sqrt(0.98298) ≈0.99145.

So L = beta * tau * 0.19733e-15 m.

Wait, no, tau is in GeV^{-1}.

Tau = ħ / Gamma =6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s.

But in GeV^{-1}, tau = 2.056875e-24 s / (6.582e-25 s GeV^{-1}) )= 2.056875e-24 /6.582e-25 GeV^{-1} → approximately 3.125 GeV^{-1}.

Wait, same as before. Because Gamma is the same (0.32 GeV), regardless of E being kinetic or not.

Wait, no, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV regardless of E being kinetic or total. So tau is the same in both cases.

So, whether E is total or kinetic, tau is same.

But if E is kinetic, gamma is higher, so beta is higher, so L = gamma * beta * c tau → higher gamma and beta would give a higher L.

Wait, no, earlier calculation: when E is total, gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887. When E is kinetic, gamma is 7.6667, beta is 0.99145. So higher gamma and beta, leading to higher L.

So when I computed L as 4.69e-15 m, that's when E is kinetic.

But the options have 4.06e-15 and 5.02e-15.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations.

Let me take a different approach, perhaps using precise formulas.

The decay length L is given by:

L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau.

But gamma and beta can be expressed in terms of E and m.

E is the total energy.

gamma = E/(m c^2) → since we're in units where c=1, gamma = E/m.

Beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So, L = (gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2)) * c * tau.

But tau = ħ / (Gamma c^2) → no, wait, tau is ħ/(Gamma), but Gamma is in GeV. So to get tau in seconds, we have to account for the units.

Wait, let me re-express everything in SI units.

E = 8 GeV = 8e9 eV.

m =1.2 GeV/c² → but to get mass in kg, we have to use m = E/(c^2) → but in kg, 1 GeV/c² is approx 1.7827e-27 kg.

So m =1.2 *1.7827e-27 kg = 2.139e-27 kg.

Gamma (width) is 320 MeV =320e6 eV.

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

E = 8 GeV =8e9 eV.

So let's compute gamma.

gamma = E/(m c^2) = (8e9 eV) / ( (1.2 GeV /c²) c^2 ) ) → units work out as gamma is unitless.

Wait, but 1 GeV =1e9 eV, so 8 GeV=8e9 eV.

m =1.2 GeV/c² =1.2e9 eV/c².

So gamma = (8e9 eV) / (1.2e9 eV) ) =8/1.2=6.6666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/44.4444))=sqrt(43.4444/44.4444)=sqrt(0.97777)≈0.9888.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV =320e6 eV.

So tau = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (320e6 eV).

But we need to convert eV to joules. 1 eV =1.60218e-19 J.

So Gamma in J: 320e6 eV *1.60218e-19 J/eV = 5.126976e-13 J.

So tau = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-13 J) ) → approximately 2.056875e-22 s.

Wait, wait, wait. Earlier I thought tau was 2.056e-24 s, but this is different. What am I doing wrong?

Wait, no, let me compute correctly.

Wait, Gamma is 320 MeV =3.2e8 eV.

Wait, no, 320 MeV is 320e6 eV.

So 320e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV → 320e6 *1.60218e-19 = 5.126976e-13 J.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-13 J) → approximately 2.056875e-22 seconds.

Wait, but earlier when I used natural units, I got tau as 2.056e-24 seconds.

Hmm, so where is the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, in natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, and 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

But when converting Gamma from MeV to J, let's recompute.

Gamma =320 MeV =320e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J.

So Gamma =320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = (320e6 * 1.60218e-19) = 5.126976e-13 J.

Tau = ħ / Gamma → (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-13 J) = 2.056875e-22 s.

Wait, so that's 2.056875e-22 s, which is 100 times larger than my previous natural unit calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, earlier I used the formula tau = ħ / Gamma, but I forgot that ħ is in J·s, and Gamma should be in J. So when I computed using natural units, I must have messed up the units.

Wait, in natural units, tau = ħ / Gamma (with ħ in GeV·s and Gamma in GeV), which gives tau in seconds.

So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau =6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is same as this calculation.

But in the SI unit calculation, I get 2.056875e-22 s.

Wait, that can't be. There's a discrepancy of 100.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in SI calculation. Let me double-check.

Gamma is 320 MeV. 320 MeV is 320e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So 320e6 *1.602e-19 = 320e6 *1.602e-19 = 320 *1e6 *1.602e-19 = 320 *1.602e-13 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 320e6 *1.602e-19.

320e6 is 3.2e8.

3.2e8 *1.602e-19 = (3.2 *1.602) )e-11 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Ah, earlier I said 5.126e-13 J, which is wrong. So Gamma is 5.1264e-11 J.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ) → approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

Ah, now it matches the natural unit calculation. So my mistake was in the SI calculation, where I miscalculated the exponent.

So tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, L = v * tau.

v = beta c.

Beta is sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 -1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So v =0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875 )e-16 m.

Compute 2.966 *2.056875.

2 *2.056875=4.11375.

0.966 *2.056875 ≈ let me compute 0.966 *2=1.932, 0.966 *0.056875≈0.0551.

So 1.932 +0.0551≈1.9871.

So total is 4.11375 +1.9871=6.0999 →6.10e-16 m.

But again, the options don't have 6e-16 m.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, the problem states that E_X is the production energy. If E_X is the kinetic energy, then we have to recalculate gamma.

Wait, let's try again with E_X as kinetic energy.

In that case, E_total = E_X + m c^2 =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.

Gamma =9.2 /1.2=7.6667.

Beta = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2))=sqrt(1 -1/(58.7778))=sqrt(57.7778/58.7778)=sqrt(0.98298)≈0.99145.

So v=0.99145 c ≈2.974e8 m/s.

Tau remains the same:2.056875e-24 s.

So L=2.974e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.974 *2.056875)e-16.

Compute 2.974 *2.056875.

2 *2.056875=4.11375.

0.974 *2.056875≈1.9995.

Total=6.11325e-16 m.

Still around 6.1e-16 m.

So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the width is given in MeV, but I should have converted it to GeV earlier. Let me double-check.

Gamma_X =320 MeV =0.32 GeV. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the initial formula for the decay length is different.

Wait, another formula I found: The mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta * c ) * (hbar c)/(Gamma c^2) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by L = (gamma * beta) * (c tau) )

But I think I've been using this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (gamma * beta * c^2 ) * (tau ) / c → which is same as gamma beta c tau.

Which is same as before.

Another thought: perhaps the velocity should be calculated using the relativistic momentum.

Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

In natural units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c².

So, in natural units, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c → but in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) GeV/c.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c².

So p = sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / (c^2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps confusing. Let me compute p.

E =8 GeV (assuming total energy), m=1.2 GeV/c².

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) → sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2 ) GeV = sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So p =7.91 GeV/c.

Then, beta = (p c^2 )/(E c ) = (7.91 GeV )/(8 GeV ) =0.98875.

Which matches earlier calculation.

Another approach: using the formula L = (p c )/(m c^2 ) * (c tau)

But p c =7.91 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So (p c)/(m c^2 )=7.91 /1.2=6.5916667.

c tau is 3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.1706e-16 m.

So L=6.5916667 *6.1706e-16 =approx 4.065e-15 m.

Ah! Now that's one of the options. Option B is4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, so perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, let me do this calculation properly.

L = (p c )/(m c^2 ) * c tau.

p c is 7.91 GeV.

m c^2 is1.2 GeV.

So (p c)/(m c^2 )=7.91 /1.2=6.591666...

c tau is 3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.1706e-16 m.

So L=6.591666 *6.1706e-16 = let me compute.

6 *6.1706e-16 =3.70236e-15.

0.591666 *6.1706e-16 ≈0.591666 *6.1706e-16.

Compute 0.5 *6.1706=3.0853e-16.

0.091666 *6.1706 ≈0.5641e-16.

So total ≈3.0853e-16 +0.5641e-16=3.6494e-16.

So 6.591666 *6.1706e-16 = (6 *6.1706e-16 ) + (0.591666 *6.1706e-16 )=3.70236e-15 +3.6494e-16 =4.0673e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So this must be the correct approach. So the answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) of the particle by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the particle and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is its rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.97777} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau.
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta = 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5917.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
