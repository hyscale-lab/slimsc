Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are given. Star_1 is 1.5 times larger in radius than Star_2, and same for the mass. Interesting. Also, the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The wavelength where the emission is strongest is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars peak at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, so T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so maybe it's stationary relative to us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but wait, the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's the rest wavelength? Or the observed wavelength? Wait, no, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But since Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength might be shifted. But wait, if both are same, that would mean that despite the Doppler shift from Star_2's velocity, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, but the problem says they have the same, so perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of temperature. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating that part. Let me think.

But the main point is that the luminosities are calculated based on black body radiation. So the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So using Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is same for both stars, then T must be same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but because Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength is shifted. Oh! Doppler effect comes into play here. The observed wavelength
