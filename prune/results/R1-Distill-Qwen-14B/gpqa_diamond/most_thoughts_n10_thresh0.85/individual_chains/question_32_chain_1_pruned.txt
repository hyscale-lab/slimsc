Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6, because lithium typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that when dealing with particles moving at relativistic speeds, we use the theory of relativity, specifically the gamma factor. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is given as 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation to find gamma.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v = 0.96c. Squaring both sides, v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Hmm, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². But wait, what's the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units (amu)? I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94 amu. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The actual mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.94 amu. Because atomic masses: H is about 1, He is 4, Li is around 7, so yeah, 6.94 amu.

But wait, sometimes for these problems, especially in particle physics, they might use the mass in terms of protons or something else, but I think it's correct to use the atomic mass. So m = 6.94 amu.

Wait, but I should confirm the exact value. Sometimes for precise calculations, the exact mass is important. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.940281 amu. But maybe for this problem, 6.94 is sufficient. But perhaps I should get a more precise value to ensure accuracy, especially since the options have four decimal places in some cases.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the molar mass in kg, but no, the way to get the rest mass energy is to convert the amu into kilograms, then multiply by c squared.

So the steps are:

1. Find gamma using v = 0.96c.
2. Find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus in joules.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the energy of the collider. I'm a bit confused about whether the energy refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy. Because in accelerators, the energy often refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it refers to the total energy.

Wait, let me think. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So the energy would be the total energy, since the speed relates to the total energy. Or perhaps it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.
