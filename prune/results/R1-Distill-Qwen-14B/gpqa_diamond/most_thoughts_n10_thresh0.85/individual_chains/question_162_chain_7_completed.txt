Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the metric given is in two dimensions, right? The line element is ds², and it's expressed in terms of dx and dy. The metric looks like this: 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So, it's a conformally flat metric because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²).

Wait, conformally flat metrics are easier to handle because the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal and the off-diagonal terms are zero, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². But in this case, both coefficients are the same, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor g has components g_xx and g_yy. Since it's conformally flat, g_xx and g_yy are the same. So the determinant is (g_xx)^2. So the square root would be g_xx, because sqrt(g_xx²) is |g_xx|, but since the denominator is 4 -x² -y², which could be positive or negative, but I think in the domain where this is defined, 4 -x² -y² must be positive. Because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric undefined or with imaginary values. So, maybe we're considering the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0, meaning x² + y² <4. Because if x² + y² is greater than 4, the denominator becomes negative, but then the metric would have a negative coefficient, which might lead to a different kind of geometry.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in 2D, a pseudosphere can be described by the metric with Gaussian curvature K. The area element on a surface with metric ds² would be sqrt(det g) dx dy, right? Wait, no, actually, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, and since the metric here is diagonal, the det is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2, so the square root is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Wait, what's the radius of curvature for a pseudosphere? Because in the case of a sphere, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, it's a surface of constant negative curvature, so the area element might be different.

Oh wait, I think the metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk has a metric like (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), where the curvature is related to the radius of the disk. Comparing that to our metric, our coefficient is 32/(4 -x² - y²). Let's see: if I factor 4 out of the denominator, 4 -x² -y² =4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So our metric becomes (32/(4*(1 - (x² + y²)/4))) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²). 

In the standard Poincaré disk model with curvature K, the metric is (4/K) / (1 - (x² + y²)/R²) (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, or maybe the curvature is K = -1/R². Let me think. The Poincaré disk model has curvature K = -1/a², where a is the radius of the disk. The metric is (4a²)/(a² - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature of a metric in conformal form (f(x,y))² (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2f)) Δ (ln f), where Δ is the Laplacian. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric corresponds to a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) with radius 2. The area of a pseudosphere is infinite because it's a surface of infinite extent, but wait, the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A)0, B)4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x²−y²), D)+infty.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm.

Wait, a pseudosphere has infinite area. Because it's like a horn that extends infinitely, so its surface area is infinite. So the area would be D) +infty. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the metric given is for a 2D surface. The area in this metric would be the integral of the area element over the entire space where the metric is defined. So the denominator 4 -x² -y² must be positive, so x² + y² < 4. Wait, that's a disk of radius 2. So the domain is a disk of radius 2, but the metric is conformally flat there. So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy over the disk x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that integral. Let me see. So the area A is ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, switching to polar coordinates. r goes from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

The 32 is a constant, so we can factor that out. Let me compute the integral:

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫(0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ) ] dr.

Let me compute ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr. Let substitution u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (r dr)/(u) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2.

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0 → ln(0) is negative infinity.

Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from the positive side, so ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

Hmm, wait, let's re-express the integral:

A = 64 π ∫(0 to 2) [ r dr/(4 - r²) ]

Let me change variables: u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫(u=4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ] = ∫(4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du.

But flipping the limits, ∫(0 to4) (1/(2u)) du.

Which is (1/2) ∫(0 to4) (1/u) du → (1/2)( ln u from 0 to4).

But ln u from 0 to4 is ln(4) - ln(0). Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, which has infinite area. So the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 would be infinite, so the correct answer is D) +infty.

Looking back at the options: D is +infty, which is option D.

So the answer should be D.


The metric provided is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. This is a conformally flat metric, meaning the area element can be computed as \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the square of the coefficient of \(dx^2\) (or \(dy^2\)), giving \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). The square root of this is \(\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\).

The area of the surface is then given by integrating the area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) is positive only when \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2. Thus, the area \(A\) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and \(d\theta\) accounts for the angular component. The integral over \(\theta\) gives \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, substitute \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\). The limits of integration change: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln u \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area of the surface is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that a pseudosphere, being a surface of constant negative curvature, has infinite area.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
