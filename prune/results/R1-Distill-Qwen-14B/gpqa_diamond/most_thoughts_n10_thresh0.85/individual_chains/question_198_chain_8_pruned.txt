Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean it has two SCN- ligands. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^, [Co(SCN)₃]^-3, and [Co(SCN)₄]^2-. Wait, no, I think the charge would be based on the number of SCN- and Co^2+.

Wait, Co is +2. Each SCN is -1. So the first complex [Co(SCN)] would have charge +2 + (-1) = +1, right? So the charge goes down by one each time we add an SCN. So the complexes are:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ → 1 SCN
- [Co(SCN)₂] → 2 SCNs (charge 0)
- [Co(SCN)₃]^− → 3 SCNs (charge -1)
- [Co(SCN)₄]^{2−} → 4 SCNs (charge -2)

But wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So that's [Co(SCN)₂], which is neutral. We need the percentage of this complex in the solution.

The stability constants β are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^{2−}.

Wait, that doesn’t seem right. Because β usually represents the equilibrium constant for
