Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the situation is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Now, the researchers want to observe which one is more likely to transit because they have limited time. The one with a higher transit probability is the better choice.

The question gives me a bunch of data points. Let me list them out:

1. Both planets have the same mass. So, their minimum masses are equal, but since RV gives us the minimum mass (without knowing the inclination), but for transit probability, maybe the actual mass isn't the main factor here.

2. Orbital periods: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit (if the star's mass is similar), but wait, the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

3. Both have circular orbits, so eccentricity isn't a factor here.

4. The host stars have the same radii. Interesting. Planet_1's host is more massive, but same size—maybe it's a main-sequence star with higher mass but similar radius? Or perhaps the other is a slightly evolved star, as mentioned. So same radius, but Planet_1's star is more massive.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is related to the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I remember is something like P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a + R_s)) ), but wait, maybe it's more accurately described by the formula P = (R_p / (R_s + R_p))^2 * (a / (a + R_s)) )? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some function of the orbital distance.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is approximately given by the formula:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (a + R_s) ) )

Wait, not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the relative size and the likelihood that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on relative to our line of sight.

The transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to its star. Because for a closer planet (smaller a), the chance that its orbit intersects our line of sight is higher. Also, if the planet's size is a larger fraction of the star's size, the transit is more likely to be detected.

Wait, but the formula I've heard is that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by [ (a) / (a) ]? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a / R_s) )) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it crosses our line of sight. The probability of alignment is (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius, but I'm not exactly sure.

Another approach: the probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a + R_s)) )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is determined by the star's radius (R_s) and the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit.

I think the formula for the transit probability is roughly P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Wait, no, that would be (R_p^2 R_s^2 )/( R_s^2 a^2 ) ), which simplifies to (R_p^2) / a^2. But that doesn't make sense because when the planet is closer (smaller a), the probability should be higher, which this would capture, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The transit probability is higher when the star's size is a larger fraction of the orbital distance. Because if the planet is very far away, the chance that it passes in front is lower.

So, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Because a higher R_s/a ratio (i.e., a smaller a) would increase the probability.

Wait, but also considering the size of the planet relative to the star. So, the probability also depends on (R_p / R_s)^2. So, the overall probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 = (R_p^2) (R_s^2) ) / ( R_s^2 a^2 ) ) = R_p^2 / a^2. Hmm, that would mean that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2. So, larger planet and smaller a increases the probability.

Wait, but that seems to ignore the star's radius, which doesn't make sense. Because a planet with a larger R_p would have a higher probability, but if the star is very large, perhaps that affects it. Or perhaps R_s is much larger than R_p, so the (R_p / R_s) term is a factor but the (R_s / a) is more significant.

Alternatively, another way: the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2) )? No, that can’t be right. Maybe the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / (a) ) )^2. Wait, so P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2) ) = R_p^2 / a^2. Hmm, same as before.

But I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

P = (R_p / (R_p + R_s))^2 * (a / (a + R_s)) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Perhaps it's better to think of the transit probability as:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ) )^2

Which again would simplify to (R_p^2) / a^2. Hmm, but I think this is getting me stuck.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about each factor that
