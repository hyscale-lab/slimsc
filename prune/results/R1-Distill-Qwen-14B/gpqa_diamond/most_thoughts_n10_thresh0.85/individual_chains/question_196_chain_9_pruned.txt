Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the motion, maybe through energy considerations or something with momentum.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here because the problem is relativistic.

Wait, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. Oh right, total energy includes rest mass energy. So maybe I should use conservation of energy, considering both the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, the oscillator is 1-dimensional, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But relativistically, I think the energy isn't the same as in classical mechanics. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in special relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for a harmonic oscillator, the energy should oscillate between kinetic and potential. But wait, harmonic oscillators in relativity aren't as straightforward as the classical case. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Perhaps it's a relativistic harmonic oscillator, so the potential is still (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² (the maximum potential energy) plus the rest energy mc². So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but at maximum speed, all the potential energy should be converted into kinetic energy. Wait no, because in the classical case, potential is max when velocity is zero, and kinetic is max when potential is zero. But in relativity, maybe energy is conserved differently. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy as the sum
