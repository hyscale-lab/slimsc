Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. They give me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so the answer must be on the order of 1e-15 or something like that, right? 

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the width of the resonance. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, when dealing with particle lifetimes, the relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ̄, where τ̄ is the mean lifetime. So the mean lifetime τ̄ is ħ divided by Γ. But I might get the formula backwards. Let me think: Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So τ̄ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, actually, I think the correct formula is τ̄ = ħ / Γ. Because the decay width Γ is the total width, which is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime. So yeah, that's right.

But wait, the energy given is the production energy, which is higher than the mass. So perhaps the particle is moving, and so the lifetime would be time dilated. Because if the particle is moving at high speed, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. Oh, right! So the lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime.

So first, I need to find the proper lifetime, which is τ̄_0 = ħ / Γ. Then, because the particle has energy E, its velocity is high, so we have to consider time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is τ = gamma * τ̄_0.

Then, the mean decay distance would be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * tau.

Wait, but how do I find gamma? The Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²), because E is the total energy. Since E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, let me double-check. Gamma is the total energy divided
