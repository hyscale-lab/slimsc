Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just electric potential energy, I think. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their respective positions. For each pair of charges, we calculate the potential energy and sum them all up.

Wait, but wait. Since all the charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount. So, maybe I can find a formula for that.

But wait, the setup is that one charge is at point P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from the central charge.

So, perhaps the system consists of the central charge and each of the 12 charges, and also the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, right. Because the potential energy comes from all pairs. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies for each pair.

So, the total number of pairs is the combination of 13 charges taken 2 at a time. But wait, in this setup, the 13th is at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So the pairs are: between the central charge and each of the 12, and between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but actually, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which is where the 13th is. But are those 12 charges themselves arranged in some way? Like, are they all at the same point 2 m away, or are they arranged symmetrically around P in some configuration? Hmm. The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so perhaps their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m. But when calculating potential energy, the exact positions beyond the distance matter, but since all are at the same distance from P, maybe their mutual distances can be considered in terms of the number of pairs.

Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy between any two charges q_i and q_j is given by U = (k q_i q_j)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them. But in this case, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. If they are all at the same distance from P but spread out on a sphere, then their distances vary. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond being at 2m from P. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy due to the central charge and the others, but not their mutual interactions among themselves. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information about the mutual distances between the 12 charges, which isn't provided. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that doesn't make sense because they would repel each other and the potential energy would be infinite if all are together. So, probably, the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energies among the 12 charges. But without knowing their exact positions, it's impossible to calculate. Wait, I must have missed something.

Wait, wait. The question is about the minimum energy. So maybe the system is arranged such that the potential energy between the 12 charges is minimized. Hmm, wait, no. For like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. So perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that maximizes their distance, but without any specific information about their arrangement, perhaps the problem is simplifying.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not considering the potential among the 12 themselves. That would make the problem solvable. Let me check the options again. The options are all numbers on the order of 1e-26 or 1e-27, which suggests that it's dealing with charges at a certain distance, so maybe it's considering only the central charge and the 12, but not their mutual interactions.

Wait, but the problem states that the system is isolated. So, perhaps the potential energy comes from all possible pairs. So, the total U is the sum of U between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the sum of U between each pair of the 12.

But without knowing the distances between the 12, how can we compute their mutual potential energy? Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 are all at 2 m from P, but perhaps they are considered to be at infinity relative to each other? That can't be right. Or maybe it's a sphere where the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 m? No, that's not possible with 12 charges. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, neglecting the mutual potential between the 12.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered. So, perhaps the problem is making the approximation that the 12 charges are so arranged that their mutual potential energy is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due
