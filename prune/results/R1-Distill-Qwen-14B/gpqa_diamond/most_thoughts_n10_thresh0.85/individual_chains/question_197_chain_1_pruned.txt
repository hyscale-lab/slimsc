Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's a peak around 1720 cm-1, that's likely a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in ketones are around 1700-1750, so maybe a ketone. Also, there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a ketone group. The 3400–2500 region might be from an alcohol or maybe an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1720, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Starting from the top: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a broad singlet, probably an acidic proton. Carboxylic acids typically have protons around 10-12 ppm. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group here. But wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1—carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700, but if it's deprotonated, it might shift. Wait, but in the presence of an acid, the IR would show a broad O-H peak around 2500-3500, which this does have. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a bit higher than a typical carboxylic acid (which is usually around 1700). Hmm. Alternatively, an ester has a carbonyl around 1720-1740. But if the compound is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't make sense because ketones don't have protons attached. So that's conflicting. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group?

Let me think again. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Also, the coupling is broad and singlet, which doesn't fit aldehyde H (which is usually a triplet due to coupling with adjacent Hs in aldehyde RCHO). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then why the 1720 cm-1? Could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ester or something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals. At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests an aromatic ring with two doublets, meaning a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are probably in para positions. So, the molecule is something like a benzene ring with two
