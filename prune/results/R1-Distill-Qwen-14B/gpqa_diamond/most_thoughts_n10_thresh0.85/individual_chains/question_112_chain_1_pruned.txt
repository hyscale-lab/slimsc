Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what's given and what's being asked.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down>. And |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is S_z, right? Because in spin systems, the up and down states are eigenstates of S_z.

So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize the state |alpha>. Because when the problem says it's "proportional" to that expression, that means it's not necessarily normalized. So I need to find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, I'll compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and set it equal to 1. Let's calculate that.

The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) because when you take the inner product, you take the conjugate transpose. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, no, the inner product is <alpha| alpha> = (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

So:

(1-i)(1+i) * <up|up> + (1-i)(2 - i) * <up|down> + (2+i)(1+i) * <down|up> + (2+i)(2 -i) * <down|down>.

But <up|up> is 1 and <down|down> is 1. <up|down> is 0, same as <down|up>.

So this becomes:

(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 + (i)(1) - i*1 -i^2 = 1 + i -i - (-1) = 1 +0 +1 = 2.

Wait, alternatively, (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2. So (1+i)(1-i) is 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Yep.

Second term: (2 + i)(2 -i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 =4 - (-1) =5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (2 +i)(2 -i)= 2*2 + 2*(-i) + i*2 +i*(-i) =4 -2i +2i -i^2 =4 +0 +1=5.

So the total inner product is 2 + 5 =7. So the norm is 7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the first part of the question is about finding the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with up and down states. So A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero, and the off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2 each. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in matrix terms, A_ij is the element in row i, column j. So for i != j, A_ij = hbar/2. So the matrix is:

Row 1: i=1, so j=2 is hbar/2. So first row is [0, hbar/2].

Row
