Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula is usually something like L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity in units of c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, since X is a resonance, which means it's a short-lived particle, right? The width Γ is related to the lifetime. I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. But wait, Γ is actually the total decay width, so the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, no, I think it's τ = ħ / (Γ/2), because Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Because the uncertainty principle says that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the energy uncertainty (which is Γ here). So the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of MeV·seconds because ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Wait, let's check the units. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Wait, but since Γ is given in MeV, I should convert units properly.

So, Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. Let's plug in the numbers.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.5
