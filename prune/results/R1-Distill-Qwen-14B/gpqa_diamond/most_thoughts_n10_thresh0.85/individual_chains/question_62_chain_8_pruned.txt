Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. And I have four options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents.

First, let me try to understand the target molecule. The name is a bit complicated. Breaking it down: the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So that's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. But wait, the substituent is at position 1. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1. But wait, in the name, it's 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the substituent is on carbon 1 as well. Oh right, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, so the structure would be cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group on carbon 1. And also, on that same carbon, there's a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So it's like, the carbon next to the aldehyde is attached to a CH2-OH and a cyclohexane ring. Or wait, maybe it's a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl and an OH. So it's like a CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane has at position 1 (I think in the numbering, position 1 is where the substituents are) a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and an OH group. And the aldehyde is on that same carbon as the CH2? No, wait, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is on the main ring. Let me think: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would have the formula OHC-CH2-cyclohexane, perhaps? Or more accurately, the aldehyde is attached directly to the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group on one carbon, and on that same carbon, another substituent: a CH2 group which has both OH and cyclohexyl groups attached.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. There's a substituent on carbon 1, which is a CH2 group. That CH2 has two substituents: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the same carbon (carbon 1) has an aldehyde group. Wait, no, because the aldehyde is part of the main structure. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group, and the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde
