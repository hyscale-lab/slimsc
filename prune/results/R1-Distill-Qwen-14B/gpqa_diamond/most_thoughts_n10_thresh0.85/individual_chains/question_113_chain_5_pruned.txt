Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to understand all the given information. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which I remember is usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is acidic and easily dissociates. But then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl system. Alternatively, it could be an amide or something else, but the question doesn't mention any N content, so probably not amides. Or perhaps an ester? Wait, if there's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700, right? So maybe the 1700 is the ester, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation or another carbonyl group. Wait, but double carbonyls seem a bit much. Maybe it's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond, which could lower the wavenumber. So maybe the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a lower wavenumber than a regular ketone.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which are the H's attached to a double bond. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene group is present. That makes sense with the IR's 1650 cm⁻¹, which could be the C=C stretch. Oh wait, typically, a C=C stretch is in the region of 1650-1600 cm⁻¹. So maybe that's it. So in the IR, the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ketone or ester), and 1650 is the C=C. But wait, 1700 is a strong peak, so it's probably a carbonyl group. Now, considering the O-H stretch from the IR, so the compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's an alcohol, the O-H peak in FTIR is broad, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is very broad and maybe even shows a strong absorption. But the fact that there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 might suggest a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group.

Looking at the options, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: C6H12O2
The degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, the formula is similar to C6H12O2. The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. But that would imply one ring or a double bond. But from NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. Also, the IR has two carbonyl peaks? Wait, no, 1700 and 1650. That might suggest two double bonds or a carbonyl and a double bond. Wait, but for example, a compound with a carbonyl (like ester) and a double bond would have two peaks in IR. So if the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two degrees of unsaturation. Wait, but the formula C6H12O2: Let's calculate the degrees again. 2n+2 = 2*6 +2=14. 14 -12=2, so 2/2=1 degree. So only one double bond or ring. Hmm. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2O. But for O, it's a bit tricky. Let me compute the degrees of unsaturation: Each double bond or ring adds one. So, Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Assuming X=0, N=0, DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond. But our compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (another DoU), which would require two DoU. So this formula might not fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula and the mass spec. The mass spectrum shows
