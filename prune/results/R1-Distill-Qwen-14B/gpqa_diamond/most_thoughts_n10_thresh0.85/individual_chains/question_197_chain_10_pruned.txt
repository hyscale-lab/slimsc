Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and predicting its product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe something like the Hofmann or the Curtius rearrangement, but wait, no, more likely it's a substitution or elimination. Oh right, when you have a compound with a good leaving group, like maybe a tosylate or something, reacting with HI could cause an elimination, forming an alkene, or perhaps a substitution. But wait, I might need to think about the starting material first.

Looking at the data given: the IR and the NMR. Let me try to decode each part.

Starting with the IR. The peaks are: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad range usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 3400 is a strong peak, and the 2500 is lower. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but sometimes a very broad peak. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is usually around 3300-3500, but maybe if it's something else. Also, at 1720 cm-1—that’s a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if the compound has a carboxylic acid, the O-H in the IR would be very broad. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together: maybe the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and aromatic rings. Or, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which would have that O-H and the carbonyl around 1700.

Looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), that's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But also, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would be around 10-12, but in this case, it's a broad singlet at 10.5. Hmm, wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a different environment, but 10.5 is a bit high for that. Maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but I need to look at the other NMR signals. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are each a doublet, integrating for 2H each. So that would suggest a benzene ring with two substituents in the para position. Wait, but if there are two substituents, each in the para position? Or one substituent that's a di-substituted group? Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but I think in this case it's more likely para because the two doublets would be from two substituent groups.

So, the aromatic protons are in a para arrangement, which is common with substituents like methyl, ethyl, etc. Now, looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests maybe a methine (CH) group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl or larger chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps a carbonyl group attached. Let me think. Let's say the aromatic ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an ester) in the para position. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR would fit a carbonyl, maybe a ketone (around 1700-1750). Oh, wait, a ketone's carbonyl is around 1700-1750. 1720 is in that range. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene with a ketone group.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show a strong peak at around 2.1 ppm for a ketone's adjacent CH3 group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester? The ester carbonyl is around 1720-1740. So maybe it's an ester. But then the IR would show an ester's O-C-O stretching around 1250-1050 cm-1. Wait, but the IR data given doesn't show anything in that region. So maybe it's not an ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. The carbonyl of a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1, but the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3000. Our IR shows a broad range from 3400-2500, which could include both O-H (for a carboxylic acid) and maybe some N-H or other groups, but I don't think there are any amines here.

So, let's think: if it's a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group. Then, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which fits. The carboxylic acid would have a peak around 10 ppm, which is our 10.5 ppm peak. But wait, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which fits an O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the 10.5 is the -COOH's O-H.

Then, looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to a carbonyl, maybe part of a CH2CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm is two protons as a multiplet, perhaps a CH2 connected to the carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, like in a -CH(CH3)- group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps part of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, the structure could be a benzene ring with a substituent on the para position, which is a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let me try to draw this mentally. So, the benzene ring has a group at the para position. That group would be something like a chain that ends with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, so maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or acid.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think: if it's para-substituted, maybe the substituent is a -COOH group. But then, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which is what we have. But what about the other signals? The 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9. Those could be from a branching in the substituent attached to the benzene.

Wait, thinking of the substituent as a propyl group attached to the benzene, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propionyl group? Like benzene with a CH2CH2COOH group? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Like, benzene with a substituent that's a carbonyl attached to a branched chain. Let's try that.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position which is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO group? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure like benzene with a substituent that is a CH2CH(CH3)COOH group, but then the O-H would be around 10 ppm as a broad peak.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, but that seems less likely given the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, like -CO-R, where R is a branched alkyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That might be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a group like CH2-CO-, but the signal is at 2.9, which is a bit upfield for a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, but that would be around 2.3-2.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a carbonyl. Like, benzene-CH2-CO-something.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a carbonyl. Wait, let me try to piece it together.

The 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet): likely O-H, so maybe a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d, 2H): aromatic protons, para-substituted.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe the carbonyl.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl group as a singlet, maybe attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): a terminal methyl, likely from an ethyl group.

Putting it together: the substituent on the benzene ring is a group that has a chain leading to a carbonyl and a branching point. For example, maybe it's a chain like CH2-CO-CH(CH3)-something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a isopropyl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, more accurately, the substituent could be a -(CH2)2-C(O)-... group? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a sec-butyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure. Benzene ring with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group connected to a carbonyl, perhaps as a ketone. So, structure would be benzene-(CO)-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but wait, the substituent would be a carbonyl group attached to a branched chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene ring. Like, benzene-CH2-CO-OH. Wait, but that would be a propanoic acid substituent. Let me see.

If it's propanoic acid attached to the benzene ring, the structure would be para-substituted. So, benzene with a -COOH group and perhaps another substituent. Wait, but in the NMR, the 8.0 and 7.2 are the aromatic protons. So, if the substituent is a -COOH group on the benzene, the ring would have two substituents? Wait, no, because the aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests only one substituent on the benzene, in the para position, because the two protons on each adjacent carbon are each a doublet.

Wait, but if the substituent is a -CH2-CO-OH, then the ring would have a substituent that's a CH2COOH group attached in the para position. Let me think. The structure would be 4-(propanoic acid)phenyl group? Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH3)COOH group.
