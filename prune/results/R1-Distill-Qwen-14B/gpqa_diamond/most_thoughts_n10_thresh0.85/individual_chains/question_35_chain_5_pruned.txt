Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that intrinsic angular momentum is related to spin. The muon is a fermion, so its spin is 1/2, right? So the possible eigenvalues for the components should be ± ħ/2, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

The question gives me Ay as a 2x2 matrix operator. It says Ay equals c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. Let me write down what S looks like. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Hmm, I think that matrix looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Wait, no, actually, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma_y is indeed the matrix I wrote above. So S is the sigma_y matrix multiplied by something? Or wait, S itself is the sigma_y matrix. Because sigma_y is exactly that structure.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, S is given as that matrix. So then, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. So if c is h/(4π), then Ay = [h/(4π)] * S.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the actual definitions. Oh right, the spin matrices are S_x, S_y, S_z, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Specifically, S = (ħ/2) sigma. So for example, S_y = ħ/2 * sigma_y.

Wait, but in this problem, S is given as the matrix [0 -i; i 0], which is the sigma_y matrix. So then, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

But wait, let me think about the units and the scaling factors. Because ħ is h/(2π), right? So h = 2π ħ. So substituting in, c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2)
