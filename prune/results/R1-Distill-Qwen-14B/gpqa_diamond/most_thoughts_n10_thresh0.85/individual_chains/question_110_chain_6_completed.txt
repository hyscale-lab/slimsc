Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. So, a star must be brighter (i.e., have a lower apparent magnitude) than both of these limits to be detected by both.

Wait, no. Wait. The way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, V less than 17? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Right, so for a star to be observed by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude (m_v) must be less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_v must be less than 16.

So the star must have an apparent magnitude m_v < 16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if m_v is less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So any star that's brighter than 16 can be seen by both. But if a star is between 16 and 17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait no, the question says which can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) AND less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). So the m_v must be ≤16, because that's the brighter limit. Because if m_v is 17, HIRES can't see it since its limit is 16.

Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Oh, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So when the question says "brighter than 17 mag", that's m_v <17. So for ESPRESSO, m_v must be less than 17 to be observed. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so m_v <16.

So a star must have m_v less than 16 to be detected by both. Because if it's less than 16, both will see it. If it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't see it.

Wait, wait, but the question is whether the star can be detected by both. So it's only the stars that are within both instruments' capabilities. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than 16. Because that's the limit for HIRES. So any star with m_v <16 will satisfy both.

Wait, but wait. Let's look at each star's given information. Some stars have absolute magnitudes, others apparent, others have E(B-V) which affects their observed magnitude.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (if given) and their distance.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- RA: 15 deg, DEC: -75 deg. Absolute V magnitude Mv =15.5 mag. Distance is 10 pc.

Wait, the formula to calculate apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + extinction (if any). But Star1 doesn't have any E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So let's compute m_v.

Mv =15.5, distance d=10 pc.

m = Mv + 5 log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 5*0 =15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.5.

So m_v =15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it, since 15.5 <16 and <17.

Star2:
RA=30, DEC=55. Apparent V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So m_v is given as 16.5. So for HIRES, which requires m_v <16, this star is too faint (16.5>16), so HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can (16.5 <17), but HIRES can't. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3:
RA=11h (converted to degrees later, but maybe not necessary), DEC=48. Apparent V mag given is 15.5, but E(B-V) =0.6 mag. So we need to calculate the extinction and add it to the apparent magnitude, because extinction makes stars appear fainter.

The formula for extinction in the V band is A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V). So 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m + A_v. Wait, wait. Let me think. No, wait: the star's light is absorbed, so the observed apparent magnitude is fainter (higher m) than the intrinsic. So if the star's apparent magnitude is m, without considering extinction, then extinction adds to it. So m_observed = m + A_v.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have it backwards. Let me think again.

Intrinsic apparent magnitude is m0. Extinction causes the star to appear dimmer, so m_observed = m0 + A_v. So yes, adding.

Star3's given m_v is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86. So m_observed =15.5 +1.86 =17.36.

So m_v is 17.36. Which is above ESPRESSO's limit (17), so ESPRESSO can't see it. So Star3 can't be detected by either instrument, perhaps? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the given m_v is 15.5, but that's before extinction. So the actual observed m_v is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So for Star3, m_v is 17.36. So ESPRESSO's limit is m_v <17, so Star3's observed m is 17.36>17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. HIRES requires m_v <16, which is way below. So Star3 can't be seen by either.

Wait, wait, wait. No, no, wait. The given data says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's before considering extinction. So the observed apparent magnitude would be higher (since extinction dims it). So the observed m_v is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So both spectrographs can't detect it because it's beyond their limits.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5. But that's without considering extinction. So if we're calculating what the actual apparent magnitude would be, considering extinction, it's higher. So Star3's observed m_v is 17.36, which is higher than both limits. So both can't see it. So Star3 can't be detected by either, so it's out.

Star4:
RA=85, DEC=-48. Absolute V magnitude Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So first, calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction. Then add the extinction.

Mv=15.5, distance d=10 pc. So m = Mv +5 log10(10/10)=15.5+0=15.5.

Now, extinction A_v=3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag.

So observed m_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_v=16.74. So for HIRES, which requires m_v <16, this is 16.74>16, so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO's limit is m_v <17, so 16.74 <17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. But HIRES can't. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5:
RA=10h, DEC=60. Absolute V magnitude Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc.

So compute m_v without extinction. Let me compute.

Mv=16.5. Distance=5 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5). Log10(0.5) is -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

So m=16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995. Approximately 15.0.

So m_v is about 15.0.

Now, Star5's E(B-V) is not given, I think. Wait, looking back: the description of Star5 says absolute V magnitude 16.5, located at 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V). So no extinction; so m_v is 15.0.

So for Star5, m_v=15.0.

Now, check both spectrographs.

HIRES: m_v must be <16. 15.0 is less, so yes.

ESPRESSO: m_v <17. 15.0 is less, so yes.

So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, let me recap each star:

Star1: m_v=15.5. Both can see it (since 15.5 <16 and <17).

Star2: m_v=16.5. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can. So no.

Star3: m_v=17.36. Both can't see it.

Star4: m_v=16.74. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m_v=15.0. Both can see it.

So which stars are detected by both? Star1 and Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit, so it can't be detected by both. So option D is incorrect.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Well, Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so it's out.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Star3 can't be detected by either, so no.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Both can't be detected by both.

Wait, did I miss any stars?

Wait, looking again:

Wait, Star1 has m_v=15.5. So both can detect it.

Star5 has m_v=15.0. Both can detect it.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options include both Star1 and Star5 together. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, none of the options have Star1 and Star5 together. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5's calculation.

Wait, Star5: Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505= approx 14.995, so about 15.0.

So m_v is 15.0. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Star1: m_v is 15.5. Both can detect it.

So which options include these two? The options don't have such an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Star1.

Wait, Star1's Mv is 15.5, distance is 10 pc.

m= Mv +5 log10(10/10)=15.5.

So 15.5 is within both's limits.

Star4: m_v was 16.74, which is over HIRES's limit.

Star5: m_v=15.0. Both can see.

So the two stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options have both. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's calculation. Let me recalculate Star5.

Star5: Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m =16.5 +5*(log10(5) -1)=16.5 +5*(0.69897 -1)=16.5 +5*(-0.30103)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So about 15.0.

Thus, m_v=15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17. So Star5 is visible to both.

So which options include Star1 and Star5? Let's see the options.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is more than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So option A is incorrect.

Option D is Star1 and Star4. Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1's calculation. Let me double-check.

Star1: Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc.

m_v=15.5 +5 log10(10/10) =15.5.

Which is correct. So m_v=15.5.

So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star5 can be seen by both.

So the correct answer would be the option that includes both Star1 and Star5, but looking at the options, that's not present. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check Star5 again. Oh! Wait, the question says that Star5's apparent magnitude is absolute, not apparent. Wait no, looking back:

Wait, the description says Star5: absolute V magnitude of 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So yes, we calculated m_v correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's calculation. Let me check.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48. Apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15pc.

So m_v without extinction is 15.5. Then extinction A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So observed m_v=15.5+1.86=17.36.

Which is above both spectrographs' limits.

So Star3 is out.

So the two stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But none of the options include both. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4's m_v=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So no.

B) Star3 and Star5: Star3 can't be seen by either.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2's m_v=16.5, which is above HIRES's limit.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption.

Wait, perhaps I got the condition wrong. The question says which stars can be detected with both. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be detectable by each. So for each spectrograph, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than the limit.

Wait, another approach: for each star, compute its apparent V magnitude, considering extinction, and then see if it's less than 16 (since that's the stricter limit).

So let's go through each star:

Star1: m_v=15.5. So less than 16. Detectable by both.

Star2: m_v=16.5. Above 16. Detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: m_v=17.36. Above both.

Star4: m_v=16.74. Above 16.

Star5: m_v=15.0. Below 16.

So only Star1 and Star5 are detectable by both.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes both is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Wait, perhaps Star1's distance is different?

Wait, Star1: distance is 10 pc. Mv=15.5. So m_v=15.5.

Star5: Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc, m_v=15.0.

So the two stars that satisfy both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have an option that includes both. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether the spectrograph can detect the star, regardless of whether it's bright enough in the instrument's capability. Or perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says, 'stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed' for ESPRESSO; so m_v <17. And for HIRES, m_v <16.

So a star must be brighter than 16 in V to be seen by both.

So Star1: m_v=15.5 <16, so both can see it.

Star5: m_v=15.0 <16, both can see.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this combination.

So perhaps I made a mistake in Star1's calculation. Wait, maybe Star1's given data is absolute magnitude, and I have to compute its apparent magnitude correctly.

Yes, that's correct. m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10) + extinction.

Wait, wait, in the case of Star4, which has Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So m =15.5 + 0 (distance) + extinction.

Wait, no: extinction is added to the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no. The formula for the apparent magnitude is m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v.

Wait, no, isn't it m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v.

Yes, because A_v is the extinction, which is added to the apparent magnitude.

So Star1: m =15.5 + 0 + 0 =15.5. Because Star1 has no extinction.

So yes, correct.

Wait, but the options don't include an option with both Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Star4's extinction is E(B-V)=0.4. So A_v=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v.

Mv=15.5, d=10 pc → 5 log10(1)=0. So m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Which is over 16, so HIRES can't detect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Let me recheck.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

Which is 15.0.

Yes.

So in the options, the only option that includes a star that both can detect is Star5 and Star1, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be detected.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m_v is 16.5, which is too high for HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is too high for HIRES.

Hmm. So none of the options seem correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate the apparent magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the formula for m is Mv +5 log10(d) -5. Because Mv is the absolute magnitude, and the formula is m = Mv +5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, yes, because 5 log10(d/10) =5 log10(d) -5.

So perhaps I should compute it as Mv +5 log10(d) -5.

Let me recalculate each star.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10.

m =15.5 +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5*1 -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5.

Same result.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5.

m=16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5 *0.69897=3.49485.

So m=16.5 +3.49485 -5 =16.5 + (-1.50515)=14.99485 → about 15.0.

Same as before.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be detected by both, but considering that some stars might not be observable due to other factors like the telescope's location. But the question says to disregard pointing limits and altitude, so those don't matter.

So perhaps I should look for the stars that have m_v <16, which is Star1 (15.5) and Star5 (15.0).

But the options don't offer that combination. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I misread one.

Option D is Star1 and Star4. Star1's m_v is 15.5, which is okay. Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit.

So that's out.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star3's distance.

Star3: distance is 15 pc.

Mv is given as apparent? Wait, no. The description says Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5, but that's before extinction.

Wait, no, no. Wait, Star3's description says: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6... located at 15 pc.'

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, no, Star3's description says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag'. So m_v is 15.5 before extinction. Then, after extinction, it's 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's m_v after extinction is 17.36, which is above both.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing which star is which.

Wait, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So the two stars are Star1 and Star5.

But since the options don't include them, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that Star5's E(B-V) is zero. Wait, looking back, the description of Star5 says nothing about extinction. So no E(B-V), so no extinction. So m_v=15.0.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be detected by at least one of the instruments, but the question says 'detected with both'.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check Star4 again.

Star4: Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc.

m =15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5.

But E(B-V)=0.4, so A_v=1.24.

So observed m_v=15.5+1.24=16.74.

Which is greater than 16, so HIRES can't see it.

So Star4 can't be detected by both.

So, the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is Star1 and Star4, but that would be incorrect because Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I interpreted the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absolute magnitude, not the apparent. But no, because the spectrographs are looking for apparent magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spectrographs' limits refer to absolute magnitude, but that doesn't make sense because the apparent magnitude depends on distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Star1's apparent magnitude.

Wait, let me recheck Star1.

Star1's Mv=15.5, distance=10 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

So yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but the options don't include. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, which is Star1 and Star4, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects that the star's absolute magnitude is considered, but that's not the case. Because the spectrographs observe apparent magnitude.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I'm not sure. But given the calculations, I'm confident that Star1 and Star5 are the correct answers. But since the options don't include them, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's distance.

Wait, Star5's distance is 5 pc.

Mv=16.5.

So m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m=15.0.

Yes.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach is to list which stars have m_v <16.

Star1: m_v=15.5 → yes.

Star2:16.5 → no.

Star3:17.36→ no.

Star4:16.74→ no.

Star5:15.0 → yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, Star1 and Star4, but that would be incorrect because Star4's m_v is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, Star4 and Star5. But Star4's m_v is 16.74>16, so HIRES can't detect it.

Wait, perhaps I should check Star3 again.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15pc.

So m=15.5 +5 log10(15/10) + A_v.

Wait, wait no. The formula is m = Mv +5 log10(d/10) + A_v, where Mv is the absolute magnitude.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for Star3, the given is apparent V mag of 15.5, but that's before extinction. So the observed m_v is 15.5 + A_v.

Wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5. But because of extinction, the observed m_v is higher. So yes, 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3 can't be seen by either.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the star's V magnitude is absolute or apparent when given. Because sometimes, the data might mix up the two.

Wait, let me re-examine each star.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So compute m_v as 15.5.

Star2: apparent V magnitude 16.5, so m_v=16.5.

Star3: apparent V magnitude 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So m_v=15.5+1.86=17.36.

Star4: absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So m =15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

Star5: absolute V magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m=15.0.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that combination.

Wait, perhaps the question allows the star to be detected by each of the spectrographs, but not necessarily the same observation. But that's not the case; the same star must be detectable by both.

So perhaps the intended correct answer is option D: Star1 and Star4.

But that can't be right because Star4's m_v is 16.74>16, so HIRES can't see it.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but my calculations suggest it's wrong. I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the ESPRESSO and HIRES limits.

Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So m_v <17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So m_v <16.

So a star must have m_v <16 to be seen by both.

So which stars meet that?

Star1:15.5 <16 → yes.

Star5:15.0 <16 → yes.

Others: Star4 m_v=16.74 >16 → no.

So only Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, which includes Star1 and Star4, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's m_v calculation. Let me recalculate.

Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m=15.0.

Yes, correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option D, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming that Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is within ESPRESSO's limit but not HIRES's.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So Star1 and Star5 are the correct ones.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering apparent magnitude.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about which stars are bright enough in their absolute magnitude, but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the spectrographs can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than their respective limits. So for a star to be observed, its V magnitude must be less than the limit.

So, for ESPRESSO, m_v ≤17. For HIRES, m_v ≤16.

So a star can be seen by both if m_v ≤16.

So which stars have m_v ≤16?

Star1:15.5 → yes.

Star2:16.5 → no.

Star3:17.36 → no.

Star4:16.74 → no.

Star5:15.0 → yes.

So the correct answer is Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D (Star1 and Star4), but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A (Star4 and Star5), but Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is too high.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the stars being observable by each spectrograph, not necessarily at the same time, but given the same star. But that's the same as what I've calculated.

I think I've made all the necessary checks, but perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitude ($m_v$) of each star. ESPRESSO can observe stars with $m_v < 17$, while HIRES can observe stars with $m_v < 16$. Therefore, a star must have $m_v < 16$ to be detectable by both spectrographs. Below is the analysis for each star:

### Star1
- **Given**: $M_v = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.5 < 16$, detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Star2
- **Given**: $m_v = 16.5$, distance $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.5 > 16$, detectable only by ESPRESSO.

### Star3
- **Given**: $m_v = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$, distance $d = 15 \, \text{pc}$.
- **Extinction**:  
  \[
  A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]
- **Observed $m_v$**:  
  \[
  m_v = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 17.36 > 17$, not detectable by either spectrograph.

### Star4
- **Given**: $M_v = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.4$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$.
- **Apparent $m_v$ (no extinction)**:  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
  \]
- **Extinction**:  
  \[
  A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]
- **Observed $m_v$**:  
  \[
  m_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.74 > 16$, detectable only by ESPRESSO.

### Star5
- **Given**: $M_v = 16.5$, distance $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.0 < 16$, detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Analysis
- **Star1**: $m_v = 15.5 < 16$, detectable by both.
- **Star2**: $m_v = 16.5 > 16$, detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: $m_v = 17.36 > 17$, not detectable by either.
- **Star4**: $m_v = 16.74 > 16$, detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: $m_v = 15.0 < 16$, detectable by both.

### Conclusion
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1** and **Star5**. However, none of the provided options include this combination. Based on the given options, the closest match is **Option D (Star1 and Star4)**, but this is incorrect because Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES. Despite this inconsistency, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice among the options provided.

**Answer: D**
