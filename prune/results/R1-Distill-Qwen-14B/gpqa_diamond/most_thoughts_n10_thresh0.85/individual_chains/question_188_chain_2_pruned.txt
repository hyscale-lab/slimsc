Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. Oh right, the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) multiplied by some factor that includes the angles, right? Because in a cubic system, it's simpler, but here it's rhombohedral, so the angles come into play.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), but wait, I might be mixing things up. Or was it using the volume of the unit cell somehow? Oh wait, I think the correct formula for d is derived from the general Miller plane equation.

I recall that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d = [ (a^2 (b c h k l ... )) / (something) ] Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

d² = (a² + b² + c² - 2ab cos gamma - 2ac cos beta - 2bc cos alpha) / (h² + k² + l² - hk (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma + ... )) No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system.

Wait, the general formula for d in a crystal is:

d = [ (a² (b² c²) ... ) ] Hmm, perhaps I should use the formula involving the volume of the unit cell. Because the volume V is a*b*c*sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma), right?

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, since all edges are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = θ), maybe the formula simplifies.

So let's denote a as the lattice parameter, which is given as interatomic distance. Wait, wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length a, right? Because in a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is a, but in a rhombohedral, a is the edge length. So yes, a = 10 Angstroms.

So the formula for d for plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k + h l + k l) * (cos θ) )

Wait, that's what I remember. Because in the cubic case, the cos terms would be zero, but here it's non-zero because of the angles.

So in this case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. Theta is 30 degrees.

So plugging in the numbers:

Numerator is a, which is 10 Angstroms.

Denominator is sqrt( (1² + 1² +1²) - (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(30°) )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, (1+1+1) = 3.

Then, (hk + hl + kl) would be 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3. So 3 multiplied by cos(30°).

Cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - (3*0.8660) ≈ 3 - 2.598 = 0.402.

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, 3 * 0.866 is about 2.598, yes. So 3 minus 2.598 equals 0.402.

So the denominator is sqrt(0.402). Let me compute that. sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.76 Angstroms. Wait, that's way larger than the options given. But the options are around 8-10 Angstroms. Hmm, that suggests I did something wrong.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Another possibility is that the formula uses a different expression.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula for the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) [ (1 - cos α)^2 + (1 - cos β)^2 + (1 - cos γ)^2 ] or something else? No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Wait, but wait, in the case of a cubic system (all angles 90 degrees), cosθ is zero, so d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

So let's see again:

h=k=l=1, theta=30°, a=10.

Compute denominator: sqrt(3 - 3 * cos 30°)

cos30≈0.8660.

So 3 * 0.8660 = 2.598.

So (3 - 2.598) = 0.402.

sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.76 Angstroms. But the options are all less than 10, except D is 10.05. So that can't be right. So what did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(θ) in a different way, such as cos(180 - θ) or something else. Wait, wait, rhombohedral has angles that
