Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass, right?

So the setup is a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed depends on the amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so we'll have to consider relativistic effects. Oh right, because at high speeds, the relativistic mass increases, or maybe it's better to think in terms of gamma factor.

The oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. I need to find v_max.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's non-relativistic. The question is relativistic, so option C might not be correct.

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we have to set the potential energy equal to the relativistic kinetic energy.

So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy K is (γ-1)mc². So setting U = K: (1/2)kA² = (γ-1)mc².

Let me write that down: (1/2)kA² = (γ -1) mc².

We can rearrange for γ:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, no, hold on. Let me double-check. The equation is:

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc²

So, solving for γ,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But wait, I need to find v_max. Since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), I'll substitute that.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term. Let's call it alpha for simplicity: alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Then square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2].

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 = [ (1+alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1+alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v²/c² = [2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator as alpha (2 + alpha) ?

But perhaps it's better to just write it as (alpha (2 + alpha)) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But wait, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that back in.

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²) )².

This looks a bit messy. Let me simplify the numerator and denominator.

Let me write the numerator as (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)), which is (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ].

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.

Wait, 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha). So:

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

I think I can factor 1/(2 m c²) terms.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Let me consider that when alpha is small, which it would be for non-relativistic cases, the expression reduces to the classical case.

Wait, but the options given include some square roots and terms. Let me think about rearranging the expression for v.

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

Which can be written as:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

But perhaps it's easier to write it as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)]^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

But the numerator (1 + alpha)^2 -1 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha)

Hmm, but let me factor alpha:

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute:

v = c * sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ) / ( 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )

Simplify the numerator inside the square root:

( k A²/(2 m c²) ) * ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as:

= (k A²) (4 m c² + k A²) ) / [ (2 m c²)^2 ]

Wait, maybe that's not the way to go. Let me think about the denominator.

Denominator is 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) = [2 m c² + k A²] / (2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] ) / ( [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, let me write this more clearly.

The numerator inside the sqrt is:

( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ).

Which is (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) ]/(2 m c²) )

= (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / ( (2 m c²)^2 )

Wait, perhaps that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of (1 + alpha).

Wait, but perhaps another approach: let's square both sides.

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

So,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

= c² [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c² (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps if I factor 1 + alpha in the denominator.

Wait, but I'm not seeing an obvious way to simplify this further. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A²/(2 m)) )^2 )

Wait, that's not matching. Wait, let me compute each option.

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, but in our expression, the denominator is 1 + alpha, where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) )

Wait, no, option B is written as sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²))) ). Hmm, but our expression is [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Option D: sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) )

Wait, no, looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )² )

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²))) )

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) )² )

Hmm, not seeing a direct match yet. Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, earlier I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Thus,

gamma = 1 + alpha = [ (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, from gamma = (1 + alpha), then 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma^2) = 1/( (1 + alpha)^2 )

So,

v² = c² ( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is the same as,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

But alpha
