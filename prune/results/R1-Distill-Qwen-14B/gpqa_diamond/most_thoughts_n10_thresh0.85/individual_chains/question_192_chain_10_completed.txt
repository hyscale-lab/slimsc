Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see. The question is about electric fields around a charged spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some specific properties when it comes to charges and electric fields.

So, the setup is this: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the center of the conductor is L, and the distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, I need to find E at point P.

First, I should think about how charges distribute in such a setup. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in such cases, the charges inside the cavity induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right. The presence of +q in the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's electrons would be attracted to the +q. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out.

So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the outer surface would be +q because the inner surface is -q. So the conductor as a whole now has a charge of +q on its outer surface.

Now, the point P is outside the spherical conductor. So when considering the electric field at P, the charges inside the conductor (but enclosed within the conductor) would influence it. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, according to Gauss's Law.

Because I remember that for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge and the radius. So, for a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L), the enclosed charge is +q, so E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/L²) multiplied by the radial unit vector.

Oh wait, but wait. The conductor is uncharged initially, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's net charge is zero? No, wait. The conductor was neutral, then placing +q inside the cavity causes the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface to have +q. So the conductor as a whole has a net charge of +q.

But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged, but then the charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. So the inner surface has -q, the outer has +q, so the conductor's net charge is +q. So yes, when considering the electric field outside, it's the same as if the charge +q were at the center.

But wait, what about the presence of the cavity? The point P is outside the conductor, so the cavity's charges (the induced ones) don't affect the field outside, right? Because the conductor's induced charges are such that the field inside the conductor is zero, and the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

Therefore, for a point outside, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right? Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but why are the other options considering l, s, and theta? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The setup has the cavity's center offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity, but not necessarily at the center. Oh, wait, but the question says that a small amount of positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. So the charge isn't necessarily at the center of the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor's response is to the presence of charge inside the cavity. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface +q. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges will redistribute freely. So the field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge were at the center, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity.

Wait, but is that correct? Suppose the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center, then the induced charges on the inner surface would adjust to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. So the inner surface would have a charge distribution that depends on the position of +q inside the cavity. But the outer surface, being a conductor, would still have a symmetric charge distribution, right?

Because for the conductor, the inner surface's charge is -q, and the outer surface's charge is +q. But the outer surface's charge distribution depends on where the inner charge is. Wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral outside, but wait, the conductor as a whole has a net charge of +q, because the inner surface is -q and the conductor initially was zero, so the outer must be +q.

Wait, let me get this straight. The conductor is initially neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, so that the conductor's net charge remains zero? Or wait, no. Because the conductor's net charge is the sum of the inner and outer charges. The conductor was neutral, so when +q is placed inside, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's net charge is zero.

Wait, no. Because the conductor plus the cavity system: the cavity is inside the conductor. So the conductor's net charge is its own, not including the cavity. Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Let me think again.

The conductor is initially neutral. The cavity is empty, so no charge there. When +q is placed inside the cavity, that charge is inside the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q (because the conductor's electrons move towards the +q), and the outer surface must have +q to balance, making the conductor's net charge zero. Wait, no. Because the conductor's original charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's total charge is zero? No, wait, because the charge inside the cavity is part of the system. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the conductor is the sphere. The cavity is inside it. So the conductor's charges are on the inner and outer surfaces. The charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q, as the conductor's material reacts to the internal charge. Then, the conductor's net charge is the sum of the inner and outer surfaces. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because conductor's inner surface is -q, so to make the conductor's total charge zero, the outer surface must be +q. Wait no, because the conductor's own charge is zero, so the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, which is the same as the charge in the cavity.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If the conductor is neutral, the sum of inner and outer must be zero. So if inner is -q, outer must be +q. So conductor's outer surface has +q.

So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the charge +q is at the center, because of the spherical symmetry. So regardless of where the +q is placed in the cavity, the field outside is the same as if it were at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is symmetrically distributed.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the cavity's center is offset by s, and the point is at a distance l from the cavity's center. So in reality, is the field affected by the displacement?

No, because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and it's distributed spherically symmetrically. So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor, not from the cavity's center.

Therefore, the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. The other options involve l, s, or theta, which don't affect the external field because the conductor's induced charges ensure that the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   - The spherical conductor is initially neutral.  
   - A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.  
   - This induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (attracted by $+q$).  
   - To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.  

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from its center, as per Gauss's Law.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor has a symmetric distribution of $+q$, so the field outside is equivalent to that of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.  
   - The distance of point $P$ from the center of the conductor is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is:  
     $$E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.$$

3. **Irrelevance of Other Parameters**:  
   - The parameters $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ (distance of $P$ from the cavity's center, offset between the centers of the conductor and cavity, and the angle between $l$ and $s$, respectively) do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - The conductor's outer surface ensures that the field outside is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not applicable here.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form $\frac{q}{l^2}$ is correct for a point charge, it does not account for the conductor's outer surface charge distribution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
