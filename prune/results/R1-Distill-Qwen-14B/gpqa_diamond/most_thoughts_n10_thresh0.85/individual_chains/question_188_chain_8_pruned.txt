Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances involve some formula with the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh wait, the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I think rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, all a, b, c are equal. But wait, in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees each. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along an edge, right? So that would be 'a' in the unit cell, because in a simple cubic structure, a is the edge length. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are a, so a=10 Angstrom here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ))), but wait, I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Or wait, another thought: the general formula when the lattice is not cubic is more complicated. I think the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²). Hmm, maybe I should look that up, but I'm trying to think from memory.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of a rhombohedral crystal. Since all angles are equal (α=β=γ=30 degrees), maybe the formula can be simplified. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and the angles are all same. So perhaps the formula simplifies because all three angles are the same.

So, let's outline the approach. The (111) plane's interplanar distance d can be found using the formula for d in terms of h, k, l and the lattice parameters. Since it's rhombohedral, the formula should take into account the angles between the lattice vectors, which is 30 degrees each.

The formula I recall is:

d^2 = (a^2)/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl
