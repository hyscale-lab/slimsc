Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each instrument. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means it can see stars up to V=17. HIRES, on the other hand, can see stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, HIRES can handle slightly fainter stars than ESPRESSO, right? Wait, no. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So 16 is brighter than 17. So, HIRES can observe fainter stars (since the limit is 16, which is dimmer than 17). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's confusing. Because the higher the magnitude, the fainter the star. So, a star with V=16 is fainter than one with V=15 because 16 is a higher number. So, if HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, that means any star with V less than or equal to 16 (brighter than 16 mag) can be observed by HIRES. And ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17, so any star with V <17 can be observed. So, the detection limits are: HIRES can detect up to V=16, ESPRESSO up to V=17. So, a star needs to be brighter than 16 for HIRES and brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh wait, noâ€”brighter than 17, meaning V <17. Because a brighter star has lower magnitude. So, if a star is brighter than 17, it's V <17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So, HIRES can see fainter stars (higher magnitude) than ESPRESSO, because 16 is brighter than 17.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. Suppose a star has V=15.
