Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are various inverse powers of parallax. 

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right! The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. 

But the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So if you consider a volume of space, the number of stars is proportional to that volume. 

So, the number of stars in a given volume would be proportional to the volume. But how does parallax factor into this? Parallax plx is given by the formula plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as d increases, plx decreases.

Let me think about how to relate the number of stars to parallax. Suppose I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us. The thickness of the shell is such that the change in distance leads to a specific change in parallax. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of a range of parallax values. 

If I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Since plx = 1/d, the corresponding distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm approaching this right. 

Alternatively, let's consider the volume of space between two distances. The volume between d and d + dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume would be proportional to the volume. So, number of stars dN = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd = (d plx)/ (d)^2). Let me compute that derivative. d(plx) = d(1/d) = -1/d² dd → so dd = -d² d(plx). But since plx is positive, I can rearrange that. So, dd = (1/(plx)^2) d(plx), but I think I'll have to be careful with the signs. 

Wait, because as plx increases, d decreases. So for a small increase in plx (d plx), d decreases by (1/plx²) d plx. So, plugging back into the volume expression, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx) / (plx²), because d = 1/plx, so dd = (d plx)/( (1/plx)^2 ) * (-1) → but since we're dealing with magnitude, perhaps the negative sign can be ignored because we're considering a small positive change in plx. 

Wait, let's recast this. The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting:

dN = n * 4π (d)^2 dd = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

But since dN can't be negative, maybe I should take the absolute value, so it becomes n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, no, that would be (1/plx^4). Or wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Starting from dN = n * 4π d² dd. We have d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. And dd = (d plx) * ( -1/(d)^2 ) ) → since d = 1/plx, substituting gives dd = (- plx^2) d plx.

So, putting it all together:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (- plx^2 d plx) )

Wait, the plx^2 in the denominator and the numerator? Let me compute:

dN = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * ( - plx^2 d plx )

The plx^2 terms cancel out: (1/plx^2) * plx^2 = 1. So dN = n * 4π * (-1) * d plx. But d plx is positive, so the negative indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars in that range should decrease. Wait, but the actual number of stars is positive, so perhaps I should have considered the absolute value. 

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the integral correctly. Let me think of the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. The volume at distance d is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume, which is 4πd² dd. 

But since plx = 1/d, we can express everything in terms of plx. 

So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. 

So substituting into dN:

dN = n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

Wait, no. Wait, 4π d² dd is the volume element. So substituting d as 1/plx: 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. And dd is (-1/(plxx^2)) dplx. So:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Which becomes:

dN = -n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx 

But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, dN is negative, which doesn't make sense because dN is the number of stars. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, so the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to (1/plx^4) multiplied by dplx. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is dN / dplx. So from the above, dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) (-dplx) → which simplifies to dN = -n 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. 

Wait, but I'm getting confused with the signs. Let me think about it another way. The number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx is proportional to the volume. So, the number density n is the number per unit volume, so the number in a thin shell of thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd. 

But when you express this in terms of plx, since d=1/plx, and dd= - (1/plx²) dplx, substituting:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

So,

dN = - n 4π (1/plx^4) dplx

But since dN is positive, this becomes:

dN = n 4π (1/plx^4) * (-dplx) → but dplx is positive, so the negative flips the sign. Hmm, perhaps I should have considered the absolute value. So, the number of stars in a given dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. 

Wait, but the question isn't about dN for a small dplx. It's about the number per unit range of plx. So, the number per unit plx would be (dN/dplx) = (n 4π) (1/plx^4) )

Wait, but when I look at dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx * (-1) → so to get the number per unit plx, it's dN/dplx = n 4π (1/plx^4). 

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. 

But wait, the options don't have 1/plx^4 as the answer; option A is ~1/plx^4. But wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait another approach: the volume at a certain distance d is 4πd² dd. So, for a given thickness in distance, the number of stars is proportional to 4πd². 

Now, in terms of parallax, when d increases by dd, plx decreases by d plx = (d^2) dd, since plx = 1/d. So, a small change in plx is d plx = (d^2) dd → which means dd = d plx / d² = plx² d plx. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars per unit plx. 

The number of stars in a thin shell (parallax between plx and plx + dplx) is:

dN = n * 4π d^2 dd.

But since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx, so d^2 = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd = (d plx) * (d^2) → because d plx = - (1/d^2) dd → so dd = -d^2 d plx → since d =1/plx, dd = -(1/plx^2) d plx.

So substituting into dN:

dN = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) d plx.

So,

dN = -n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But dN is positive, so we take the absolute value:

dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit change in plx (dN/dplx) is n *4 π (1/plx^4) → which means the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused because the formula I remember for the distance modulus and the number of stars. I think the number of stars in a given volume (so, per unit distance cubed) is uniform, so the number of stars per unit volume is n. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4πd² dd. 

But when we express this in terms of parallax, which is plx = 1/d, the number of stars in a shell with parallax from plx to plx + dplx would be:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) → because dd = (1/plx^2) d plx. So,

dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is (dN/dplx) = 4 π n (1/plx^4) → which implies the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could I have messed up the exponents? Let me think again. 

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d². But since parallax is 1/d, the shell's thickness in terms of parallax is d plx = (1/d^2) dd. So, dd = d^2 d plx.

Thus, the number of stars in a parallax shell (from plx to plx + d plx) is:

dN = n * 4 π d² * (d plx /d²) ) → because dd = d^2 d plx → so:

dN = n *4 π d^2 * (d plx /d^2 ) = n *4 π d^2 * (d plx) / d^2 → the d² cancels out, so dN = n *4 π d^2 (d plx) / d^2 → no, that's not right. Wait, let me redo that.

Wait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me do it correctly.

dN = n * 4 π d² * dd.

But dd = (d^2) d plx.

So,

dN = n *4 π d² * d^2 d plx → d^4 d plx?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if d plx is the change in parallax, then when d increases, plx decreases, so the relation is plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d^2) dd → so dd = -d^2 d plx.

So,

dN = n *4 π d² * (-d^2 d plx) → negative because dd is negative when plx increases.

But since we're considering the magnitude, perhaps we can ignore the sign. So,

dN = n *4 π d^4 d plx. 

Wait, that makes dN proportional to d^4 which would be (1/plx)^4. Because d=1/plx → d^4 = 1/plx^4.

So, dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is (dN/d plx) = n *4 π (1/plx^4) → so proportional to 1/plx^4.

That matches option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars per unit parallax would depend on the square of something. Maybe I should think about it in terms of solid angles.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is 4πd² * n * (thickness), where thickness is in distance. So, the number is n *4 π d² * dd.

But in terms of parallax, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Substituting:

dN = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) d plx → which gives dN = -n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Ignoring the negative sign, so dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is (dN)/(d plx) = n *4 π (1/plx^4) → which means number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell.

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). The number of stars in a shell with parallax ranging from \( \text{plx} \) to \( \text{plx} + d\text{plx} \) is:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars. Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = -n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Taking the absolute value (since the number of stars is positive), we find:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
