Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do these symmetries mean? I remember that Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry in space-time. So, if an effective theory respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincaré? Or are they separate?

SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that could be added to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. I think the SMEFT operators are constructed to respect the Standard Model's gauge symmetry, like SU(2) and U(1), but what about other symmetries like Lorentz?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry would require the operators to be scalars under the Lorentz group. So any operator in SMEFT should be a Lorentz scalar. So yes, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But then what about Poincaré? Because Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. If the theory is Lorentz symmetric, it's automatically Poincaré if it's also translationally invariant. I'm not entirely sure, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid up to some cutoff scale. So translations are definitely part of the symmetries, so Poincaré symmetry must be respected. But wait, in the SMEFT, do the operators have to transform in a way that maintains Poincaré? Or is it that the entire theory is Poincaré invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to carry the symmetry themselves?

Wait, the question is about the operators respecting the symmetry. So, each operator must be a scalar under the symmetry group.

Hmm, Lorentz symmetry: yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So operators are Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes translations. So the operators must be invariant under translations too. But wait, translation invariance is a global symmetry, right? So in
