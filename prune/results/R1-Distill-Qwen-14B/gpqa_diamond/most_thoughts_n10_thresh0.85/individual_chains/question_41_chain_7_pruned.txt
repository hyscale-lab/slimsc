Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So, does that mean the light is moving with the glass, or is the glass moving while the light is inside it?

I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh, right, this might be a case where I need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities, or maybe just the classical approach. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, right? So if the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of the light as observed?

Wait, let me think about the frame of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But since the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, I need to find how this affects the observed speed.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light
