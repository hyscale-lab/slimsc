Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves the lattice parameters and some trigonometric functions. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 equals (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) plus some terms involving the angles. But wait, I'm a bit confused because this depends on the type of crystal system.

Right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, so a = b = c. And the angles α, β, γ between the axes are all the same as well. In this case, the question says α=β=γ=30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c and all angles 30 degrees, and interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, wait—interatomic distance usually refers to the atomic radius or maybe the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter? Maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, no, the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is just 'a'—so for a simple cubic lattice, the interatomic distance is the lattice constant a. So in this case, a = 10 Angstrom. Because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners, and if it's a primitive lattice, the interatomic distance (edge length) is 'a
