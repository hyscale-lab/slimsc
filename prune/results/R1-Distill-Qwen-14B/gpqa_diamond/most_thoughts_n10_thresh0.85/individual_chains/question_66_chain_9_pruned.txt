Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with the Standard Model symmetries.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, so first, what do these symmetries mean? Lorentz symmetry is about how physics looks the same in all inertial frames, right? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, like moving from place to place. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry, meaning the laws are the same under swapping particles with their antiparticles and reflecting space. CPT is the combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal; that's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory because of the CPT theorem.

In SMEFT, the operators are built to preserve the Standard Model's symmetry. The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry (like SU(2), SU(3)), and also respects CP symmetry, though not all SM interactions are CP even necessarily. Wait, but the SM isn't CP symmetric in all its interactions, like the CKM matrix in quark mixing causes CP violation. Oh, but SMEFT operators are constructed to be compatible with the SM, so they must preserve the SM's symmetries. So if the SM doesn't have a certain symmetry, like CP, then the operators don't need to respect that either? Or wait, no. Wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators, but they are organized into operators of higher dimension. Each operator must individually respect the symmetries of the SM, right?

Wait, no—because if the SM doesn't have a certain symmetry, then the operators can break it. For example, the SM doesn't have CP symmetry in some cases, so operators in SMEFT might not have to conserve CP either.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So which symmetries are always preserved?

I think Lorentz symmetry has to be there because all the operators must be consistent with the Standard Model, and the SM includes Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes translations (like moving from one point to another) and Lorentz. So if the operators are part of the effective theory, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory, they would also respect Poincaré symmetry. Because effective field theories are built respecting Poincaré, right? So I think both Lorentz and Poincaré are required.

Wait, but wait. Some higher-dimension operators might break some symmetries. No, wait, SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must form a Lorentz-invariant expression. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected by all operators.

Poincaré symmetry includes translations. Well, the SMEFT operators are part of a local field theory, so they should respect momentum conservation, etc., which would imply Poincaré symmetry. So I think both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, about CP and CPT. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry in all cases—like in the CKM matrix. So
