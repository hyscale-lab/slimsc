Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about which planet is more likely to transit, right? Let me read the problem again.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Their orbits are circular, and their host stars have the same radii. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same size.

Hmm. So the key here is to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I recall is something like the probability P is roughly (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that might not be exact. Let me think.

Oh right, the transit probability formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + sqrt( (R_planet / R_star)^2 + (R_planet / R_star)^2 )) ), but since Earth-like planets are much smaller than the stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the formula simplifies to P = R_star / (a). So the probability is proportional to R_star and inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a.

Wait, but I should make sure. Alternatively, another way to think about it: the planet has to be in the correct orientation for its orbit to cross our line of sight. The probability is higher if the orbital plane is edge-on, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

So for a given star, the probability is P = (R_star / a) * (some factor considering the inclination). Wait, no, the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (m_planet / m_star)^(1/3)) ) )? No, maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's step back. The probability that a planet transits is given by R*/(a*(1 - e²)^0.5), where R* is the radius of the star, a is the semi-major axis, and e is the orbital eccentricity. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so e=0, so it simplifies to P = R*/a.

So, P is directly proportional to R* and inversely proportional to a.

In this problem, both stars have the same radius, R*1 = R*2. So the probability only depends on a.

Wait, but wait another thing: the semi-major axis a isn't the same as the orbital period. The orbital period relates to a via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) a³. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star (m << M), we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

But in this problem, the stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So M1 = 2 M2.

Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = P2 /3, since P1 is three times shorter than P2.

So for a1 (semi-major axis of Planet_1) and a2 of Planet_2:

a1 = [ (G * M1 * P1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G * M2 * P2²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me plug in the numbers. M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So substitute M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2/3 into a1:

a1 = [ G*(2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 M2 * P2²/(9) ) / (4π²/G) ) ]^(1/3 ) * (G/(4π²))^(1/3) — wait, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio a1/a2.

Compute a1 / a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * (P2²/(9)).

Denominator: M2 P2².

So the ratio becomes [ (2 * (P2²/9) ) / (P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

The P2² cancels out. So [ 2/(9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of that is approximately 0.606.

Wait, no, let me compute 2/9. 2/9 is 2 divided by 9, so about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is around 0.606? Let me compute 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Because a is in the denominator of the probability formula, P = R*/a, and R* is the same for both, the planet with the smaller a will have a higher probability of transiting. Since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the probability P1 is (R*/a1) = R* / (0.606 a2) ≈ (1/0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times the probability of Planet_2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because a is smaller, so 1/a is larger.

So because a1 is 0.606 a2, R*/a1 is (R*/a2) / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 (R*/a2). So yes, P1 is higher.

So looking at the options, the one that says Planet_1 is preferred because it's about 1.65 times higher. That's option C.

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

Yes, that sounds correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_\text{star}}{a}
\]

where \( R_\text{star} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_\text{star,1} = R_\text{star,2} \)), the probability depends only on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_\text{star} \) as:

\[
a \propto \left( \frac{M_\text{star} P^2}{1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_\text{star,1} = 2 M_\text{star,2} \)).
- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

Substituting these values into the formula for \( a \), the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_\text{star,1} P_1^2}{M_\text{star,2} P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2 M_\text{star,2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_\text{star,2} P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R_\text{star}/a_1}{R_\text{star}/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this analysis, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
