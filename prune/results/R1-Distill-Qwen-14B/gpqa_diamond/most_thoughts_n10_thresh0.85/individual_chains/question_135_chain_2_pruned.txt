Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to figure out which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, right, so the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, it's probably written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). But I'm not entirely sure. Oh well, maybe the specific terms aren't as important as the fact that the boson X is interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find which fermions it can decay into. Remember, for a boson to decay into two fermions (like a pair of particles and their antiparticles), the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the boson's mass. Because in particle physics, for a decay to be possible, the energy (mass) of the boson must be at least enough to produce the rest mass of the decay products.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. So m_X is 6 GeV. So, I need to list all fermions where their mass is ≤ 3 GeV, because 2 times that would be 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Are the fermions in the problem considering all possible types, or just the ones in the Standard Model? I think it's the Standard Model fermions. Let's think about their masses.

The known fermion masses are roughly:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (≈0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV (≈0.004-0.005 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95-105 MeV (≈0.095-0.105 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Also, neutrinos are very light, but in the Lagrangian, if X interacts with neutrinos, but since their masses are negligible, they probably aren't considered here.

Wait, but the decay would have to be into a pair of particles, so for each pair, I have to consider if their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So, for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list them:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.105 GeV → yes
- τ: ~1.777 GeV → yes (since 1.777 <3)
- u: ~0.002 GeV → yes
- d: ~0.004 GeV → yes
- s: ~0.105 GeV → yes (since 0.105*2=0.21 <6)
Wait, but wait: when considering the decay, the rest mass of each fermion must be <= 3 GeV, because 2m_f <=6.

Wait, no, wait: if the fermion is a quark, the mass is for the quark itself. But when a boson decays into a quark-antiquark pair, the sum of their masses would be 2m_q, right? Because each quark has mass m_q, so together 2m_q.

So, 2m_q must be ≤6 GeV → m_q ≤3 GeV.

So which quarks have m_q ≤3 GeV?

u: 0.002 GeV → yes
d: 0.004 GeV → yes
s: 0.105 GeV → yes
c: ~1.5 GeV → 1.5 is less than 3 → yes
b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no
t: way over.

So, possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Now, the charged leptons:

e, μ, τ.

e is way under, μ is 0.1 GeV, τ is ~1.78 GeV.

So, for each of these, 2m would be:

e: 0.001 <6 → yes
mu: 0.21 <6 → yes
tau: 3.556 GeV. Oh wait, tau is 1.777, so 2*1.777=3.554 <6 → yes.

So, any pair of these leptons can be produced.

Wait, but the problem is about X decaying into a pair. So which particles can X decay into?

So, looking at the options, each option lists possible decay modes.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the b quark is ~4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is ~9 GeV which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar, because 6 GeV < 9 GeV.

So option A is incorrect because it includes b bbar.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Hmm, c quark mass is ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c is ~3 GeV, which is ≤6 → allowed.

So all quarks except b are allowed in this option.

So in option B, the allowed pairs are c, s, u, d, as well as tau, mu, e.

So that looks correct.

Option C: includes t tbar, which is way too heavy (m_t is 173 GeV, 2m_t is 346 GeV way over 6 GeV). So option C is wrong.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, etc. Again, including b is not allowed. So option D is wrong.

Wait, but looking back, option B is the only one that excludes b and t, but includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So, the allowed decays are into any fermion pair where m_f ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decay modes are:

c cbar → allowed (m_c ~1.5 GeV)
s sbar → allowed (m_s ~0.1 GeV)
u u bar → allowed
d dbar → allowed
tau+ tau- → allowed (m_tau ~1.78 GeV)
mu+ mu- → allowed
e+ e- → allowed

So, which
