Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But the question is about luminosity, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here. Oh wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosity ratio assuming black body radiation, so maybe mass is a red herring.

The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, λ_max would change. So, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that means their peak emission is at the same wavelength. So yeah, same T. Because Wien's Law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh right, R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities depends on the ratio of their radii squared. Oh wait, because L is proportional to R².

Wait, let's write the formula. L₁ / L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)² * (T₁ / T₂)^4. But T₁ = T₂, so (T₁ / T₂)^4 is 1. So L₁/L₂ = (R₁ / R₂)^2.

Given that R₁ is 1.5 times R₂: R₁ = 1.5 R₂. So R₁/R₂ = 1.5.

So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L₁ is 2.25 times L₂. So the factor is 2.25. So option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. Oh wait
