Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies. The problem says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is 5x10^10, and temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. So Ca-EDTA is a complex ion where EDTA is binding to Ca²+. The complex dissociates, I suppose, into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that.

The formula for the complex formation is probably Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The equilibrium constant K is given, which is 5e10. That's a pretty large K, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. But I'm supposed to find [Ca²+] in solution.

Since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as [CaEDTA]^2-.

Let me set up an ICE table for the dissociation:

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
When some of the complex dissociates, let's say 'x' mol/L dissociates. So:
[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x

The equilibrium concentrations are:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x will be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

The expression for K is:

K = ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) / [CaEDTA^2-]
So, 5e10 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)

Since K is so large (5e10), the denominator 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02, because x is going to be really small. So I can approximate:

5e10 ≈ x² / 0.02
Multiply both sides by 0.02: x² ≈ 5e10 * 0.02
5e10 * 0.02 is 1e9. So x²=1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4?

Wait, that can't be right because 3.16e4 is way larger than 0.02. Oh wait, wait! I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate that step.

Wait, 5e10 times 0.02 is 1e9? Let's compute 5e10 * 0.02. 5e10 is 50,000,000,000. Multiply by 0.02 → 1,000,000,000 → yes, 1e9. So x²=1e9 → x=1e4.5? Wait, 1e9 is 10^9, so sqrt(1e9) is 10^(4.5) which is about 3.16e4. But wait, that would make x=3.16e4, which is 31600 M. But that's impossible because the initial concentration of the complex is only 0.02 M. So that can't be right. So my assumption that x is small must be wrong. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, did I set up the equation correctly? Let me think again. Oh! I think I might have gotten the direction of the reaction wrong. Because the complex is Ca-EDTA, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−

So the K for this reaction is K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, no, that's the formation constant. Oh right, the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaEDTA²− 

And Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

So when the complex dissociates, it's the reverse reaction. But in this problem, we're starting with the complex, so the K given is for the dissociation? Or is it the formation constant?

Wait, the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf, because that's a typical notation. So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ) =5e10.

So, in the solution, the complex is already formed. So the reverse reaction is the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, which would have an equilibrium constant Kd=1/Kf.

But wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the dissociation of the complex. Let me think: the complex is in solution, and it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the reaction is:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The equilibrium constant for this dissociation would be Kd=1/Kf. So Kd=1/(5e10)=2e-11.

So, for this dissociation, Kd is 2e-11. Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will be approximately 0.02 - x, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will be x each.

So the expression is Kd = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 -x) = 2e-11.

Assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

Then, x² ≈ (2e-11)(0.02) =4e-13. So x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4x10^-13, so sqrt is 2x10^-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That looks right.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because in the initial setup, when the complex dissociates and the solution is at equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both x. But EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, it's usually present as various protonated forms depending on pH. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I probably don't need to consider the different protonation states of EDTA. So the assumption that [EDTA^4-] is x is correct.

So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant for the dissociation is given as \( K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \).

### Step 1: Set up the equilibrium concentrations
- Initial concentration of the complex: \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]_0 = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
- At equilibrium:
  \[
  [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
  \]

### Step 2: Write the equilibrium expression
The equilibrium constant for the dissociation is:
\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]
Substitute the equilibrium concentrations:
\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Since \( K_d \) is very small (\( 2 \times 10^{-11} \)), \( x \) will be much smaller than 0.02. Thus, \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \). The equation simplifies to:
\[
K_d \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Substitute \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):
\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]
\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The concentration of calcium ions at equilibrium is approximately \( [ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
