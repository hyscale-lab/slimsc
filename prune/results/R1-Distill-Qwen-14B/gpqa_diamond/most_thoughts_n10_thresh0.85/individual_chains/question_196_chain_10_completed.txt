Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D. Oh right, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator is non-relativistic, but here we're considering relativistic effects. So I need to account for the fact that at high speeds, the relativistic mass increases, which affects the equations of motion.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at max speed is (1/2)mv_max². So equating them, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so option C is probably not the right answer.

In relativity, the mass increases with velocity. The relativistic mass m_rel is gamma times m, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equations of motion would change because the mass isn't constant anymore.

The force is given by F = -kx. But in relativity, F = d(m_rel v)/dt. Hmm, or wait, the force in terms of momentum. Because F = dp/dt, and p = gamma m v. So F would be d(gamma m v)/dt.

But wait, the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², right? But the kinetic energy is (gamma m c²) - m c². So the total energy E is (gamma m c²) = (1/2)kA² + m c².

Wait, no. The total energy in the harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the potential is maximum, so kinetic is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), potential is zero, so kinetic is maximum. So when the oscillator is at x=0, its speed is maximum. So in that case, the total energy is (1/2) k A² + 0 (potential) and the kinetic energy is (gamma m c²) - m c².

Wait, no. The total energy in relativity is gamma m c², but the oscillator's potential is (1/2)k A². So perhaps the maximum kinetic energy (when x=0) is (gamma m c²) - m c² = (gamma -1) m c². But that equals the potential energy at max displacement, which is (1/2)k A².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy of the oscillator is (1/2)k A² in the non-relativistic case. But with relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy equation is E = (gamma m c²) = (1/2)k A² + m c². Oh wait, that can't be right because when the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be the rest energy plus the potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

But wait, when it's at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So at that point, the total energy must be equal to the sum of rest energy and potential energy. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy of the oscillator. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². But this E must also equal the total relativistic energy at any point, which is gamma m c².

Wait, wait. When x is A, the speed is zero. So the total energy would be the rest energy plus potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So the total energy is gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A². So gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for v.

First, take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Factor out the 1:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

Expanding (1+alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator:

1+2a + a² -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor a from numerator:

= c^2 [ a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a)^2 ].

But a is alpha, which is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let's substitute a back.

v² = c² * [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Hmm, maybe simplifying this. Let me compute each term step by step.

Wait, maybe it's easier to proceed with the earlier equation:

gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me write this as:

gamma = ( (2 m c²) + k A² ) / (2 m c² )

Wait, no. Wait, 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ (2 m c²) + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² )

So,

gamma = [ (2 m c² + k A² ) ] / ( 2 m c² )

Thus,

gamma^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so gamma^2 is 1/(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Taking reciprocal,

1 - v²/c² = [4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the expression I have for v^2.

Wait, going back. From earlier:

v^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Which is,

= c² [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) ) ]

Simplify numerator: 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v^2 = c² ( 2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: alpha (2 + alpha )

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so:

v^2 = c² [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Hmm, let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from numerator and denominator where possible.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Compute numerator:

Numerator term: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

Wait, 2 + x = (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2 ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

= (k A^2) * (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / [ (2 m c^2) * (2 m c^2) ) ]

Denominator term: (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2

= (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

So putting it all together:

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ]

Simplify the fractions.

The denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator are the same, so they cancel.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2)^2 ) * (2 m c^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) / (2 m c²)^2 ) ] * [ (2 m c²)^2 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

So, the (2 m c²)^2 terms cancel.

Then,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator and denominator:

Notice that 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor out (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) from the numerator.

Wait,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

But the denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not obvious. Let's see the expression:

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

This seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can write it as:

= c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, maybe factor out 2 from 4 m c²:

4 m c² = 2 * 2 m c².

So,

= c² * [ k A^2 (2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

= c² * k A^2 [ (2*(2 m c²) ) + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's think about the options given. Option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1 / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, but that seems different from what I have. Let me see.

Wait, my expression for v is sqrt( c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] ), where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 )

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2.

1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 = [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² ) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v = c sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha ) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, let me factor alpha out from numerator:

= c sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha ) ) / (1 + alpha )

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Let me write this as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ] ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Simplify the sqrt part:

sqrt( [ (k A^2) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 )^2 )

= sqrt( [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / ( 2 m c^2 )

Which is [ A sqrt( k (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ] / ( 2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's factor out (2 m c^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator in the denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) → (something) equals 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, maybe let me write the entire expression as:

v = c * [ sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha ) ) ] / (1 + alpha )

Where alpha = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 ) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (2 m c^2 ) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps a substitution would help. Let me set beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

alpha = beta.

Then,

v = c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta ) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, but the denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2, but in our case, alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, so (k A^2)/(2m ) would be a larger term unless c is big, which it is, but perhaps in the denominator inside the square root, the expression would be different.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, that's the square root of (1 + [1/(1 - x)] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

But in our expression, v is c multiplied by something. Let me compute the expression I have.

Wait, our expression is v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) ) / (1 + alpha )^2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, earlier I had:

v² = c² (2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha² ) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, perhaps factor alpha:

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha ) ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( alpha ) * sqrt(2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )

But I'm not sure if that leads me directly to any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps square both sides.

v² = c² (2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Let me expand the denominator: (1 + alpha )^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v² = c² (alpha (2 + alpha )) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² )

But not sure.

Wait, let me consider the denominator as (1 + alpha )². If I factor numerator and denominator:

v² = c² * alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )².

Hmm, perhaps express as:

v² = c² * [ alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2 ]

= c² * [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

c² * [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2 = c² [ (alpha (2 + alpha )) ] / ( (1 + alpha )² )

Not seeing a clear pattern yet.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the right direction. Let me compute option B:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let's compute 1/(1 - x ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 + [1/(1 - x ) ] = [ (1 - x ) + 1 ] / (1 - x ) = (2 - x ) / (1 - x )

Then,

sqrt( (2 - x ) / (1 - x ) ) = sqrt( (2 - x ) ) / sqrt(1 - x )

But I'm not sure if this matches any of our expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong approach earlier. Let me think differently.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², same as non-relativistic, but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) m c². So the total energy is E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

So,

gamma = ( (1/2)k A² + m c² ) / (m c² )

= (k A² + 2 m c² ) / (2 m c² )

= [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / ( 2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c^2 )

Thus,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c² + k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 m c²:

= [2 m c² (2 m c^2 ) + 2 m c² * k A^2 ] / ( 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Wait, perhaps better to write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c² + k A² )/( 2 m c² )

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (2 m c² )/(2 m c² + k A² )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = [4 m² c^4 ] / ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2

So,

v² = c^2 [ 1 - (4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2 ( 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So,

v² = c^2 [ 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ) ]

Wait, because (2 m c^2 )^2 =4 m² c^4. So,

v² = c^2 [ 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ) ]

Simplify the fraction:

= c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ]

Which is what I had earlier.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Hmm, looking at the options, none of them directly match this form.

Wait, let me see option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So option D would be:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ] )

Wait, wait, option D is written as: c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have. So option D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is written as:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) )

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, exactly what I have. So the answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the speed is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
