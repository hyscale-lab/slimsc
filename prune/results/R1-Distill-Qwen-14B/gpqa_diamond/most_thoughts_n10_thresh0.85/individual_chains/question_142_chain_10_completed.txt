Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because qubits are two-level systems. Oh wait, I remember that the state of a qubit can be represented on the Bloch sphere, which is a geometrical way to visualize it.

So, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me break this down. The |0><0| is a projection operator that's 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (1,1) position. Adding them together would sum their diagonal elements, right?

Wait, no, wait. Each term is a matrix. Let me write them out. The identity matrix I is |0><0| + |1><1|. So ρ is (1/2)(I). Because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, in terms of the Bloch sphere, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form for a single qubit state is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in this form, I can find r.

Given that ρ is (I)/2, that implies that the term r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r·σ =0. That means the vector r is zero. Because if all components are multiplied by σ matrices and add to zero, each component must be zero.

So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because a completely mixed state has equal probabilities for 0 and 1, which this ρ does. 

Wait, another way to think about it: the density matrix ρ is a mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So it's a maximally mixed state, which in Bloch sphere terms is at the center. That's the origin, so r is zero vector.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a single-qubit state can generally be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing a maximally mixed state. 

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.

Answer: C
