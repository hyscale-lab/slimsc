Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible. So, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since all charges are identical and the system is isolated, I think the formula involves summing up the potential between each pair of charges.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So each q is 2 times the elementary charge, right? e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So q = 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are all at radius 2m.

So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. For identical charges, each pair contributes the same amount.

But wait, calculating all possible pairs. Let's think. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th, and also with each other.

Wait, no. The 13th is fixed at P, so the 12 are each at 2m from P. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be greater than 2m, because they're on a sphere of radius 2m. But wait, if all 12 are on a sphere and fixed at that radius, the distance between any two charges depends on the angle between them. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but if they're constrained to stay at 2m, maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at
