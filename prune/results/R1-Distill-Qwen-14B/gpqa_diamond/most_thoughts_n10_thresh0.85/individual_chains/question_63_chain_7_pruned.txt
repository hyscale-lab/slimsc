Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon such that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D.

Wait, the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a combination of rotation and vibration (bond stretching) in the molecule. So the energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational states.

The molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s.

First, I should figure out what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the vibrational quantum number is n=0, and the rotational quantum number is J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it will transition to a higher energy state. The next lowest energy state would be the next possible state. But wait, what is the next state? It could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1) or a combination. But since the problem says the lowest possible energy increase, it's probably the smallest energy jump. So maybe the photon causes a transition to the next vibrational level, which is n=1, with J=0. Or maybe a transition from J=0 to J=1 with n=0. Which requires less energy?

I need to calculate the energy differences for both transitions and see which is smaller.

Wait, but the question mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the smallest possible energy increment. I should find the energy of the photon needed to cause the transition and then find the momentum from that.

So, the energy levels for vibration are given by the quantum harmonic oscillator formula. The energy for each vibrational level is E_vib = (n + 1/2) hbar ω. The difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = hbar ω.

For rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass.

So the rotational energy for J=0 is 0, and for J=1 it's (ħ² / (2I)) * 2. The energy difference would be 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but given that I can compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, I need to find which is smaller. The photon's energy should match the smaller of the two to allow the molecule to transition to the next lowest state.

So let's calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

First, let's get the reduced mass μ. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu.

Calculating that: 20*2=40, 20+2=22. So μ = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, let's convert that to kg because we'll need it for calculations. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605:

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, and 0.018 * 1.6605 = ~0.02989. Total is about 3.01879e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * (2 - 0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no. The energy for J is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, E changes by E(1) - E(0) = (ħ²/(2I))(2) - 0 = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

Compute that. Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / (1.2075e-46) → let me compute that.

1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2075) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 → ~9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is hbar ω. So that's 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, comparing ΔE_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J and ΔE_vib ≈4.218e-20 J. The rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would need to have energy matching the rotational transition, since 9.21e-23 is less than 4.218e-20.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait no, wait. Let me think again. Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state, so both J=0 and n=0. Upon absorbing a photon, it can either go to J=1, n=0 (rotational excitation) or J=0, n=1 (vibrational excitation). But between these two, which requires less energy? The lower energy transition is the rotational one, so that's the one the molecule would prefer to make.

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational energy difference, E_rot = ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests the smallest possible energy jump. So the photon's energy should be the minimum possible to get to the next state, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, wait. No wait, another thought: I think the molecule can also transition to a state where both J and n increase, but that's a higher energy state. But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, it's the smallest possible E increase, so the minimum between the two possible transitions.

So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light.

Wait, no, I think E = h f = pc, where h is Planck's constant, f is frequency, and p is momentum. So p = E / c.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. E = pc → p = E/c → yes.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options given are A) 1.9e-28 Ns, B) 2.3e-27, etc.

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s, so the options are in N·s, which is same as kg·m/s. So our computed p is 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. The options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Let me recheck the calculations.

First, the reduced mass μ:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.81818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I = 3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational energy difference is ΔE_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * (2) ?

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Thus, the energy difference is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So that part was correct.

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.2068e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct.

E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

So p_photon = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, let me compute that:

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but perhaps the problem is considering the vibration as the dominant transition, or perhaps I mixed up rotational and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the next state is the first excited state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that might be more complicated.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of both rotational and vibrational energies? But that would be even higher, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the reduced mass.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) )= (20 * 2)/(22) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1.818 amu *1.66e-27 kg/amu = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

That part seems right.

Moment of inertia I= μ R² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't account for bond length changes. But the question says non-rigid rotor model, which includes vibration. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor) considers both the rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are a combination. But for the fundamental state, it's n=0 (vibrational) and J=0 (rotational). The next state could be either J=1 or n=1. So the minimal transition would be the one with lower energy.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energies.

Let me recheck the numerical values.

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Compute ħ²: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05e-34)^2 = approx 1.10e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.10e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = let's compute that.

1.10e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = (1.10 / 1.2064) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9115 *1e-22 → 9.115e-23 J.

That's correct.

ΔE_vib = hbar * ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot is about 9.2e-23 J, which is way smaller than ΔE_vib.

So the photon must have E_photon = 9.2e-23 J. So p_photon = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are this small. The options are all in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the rotational energy is given in terms of the rotational constant, which is B = ħ²/(2I).

So ΔE_rot for J=1 is 2B, since E_rot for J=1 is 2B.

Wait, but B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I).

So then, E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0, J=1, E=2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B and then find 2B.

Let me compute B.

B = ħ²/(2I) → 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / 2.413e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J, which matches what I had before.

Hmm. So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, leading to p_photon = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. So clearly, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused frequency with something else. Wait, the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. Oh, but for the vibrational energy, it's hbar ω, which is E = (n + 1/2) hbar ω. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is hbar ω, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy as the next state, but perhaps the calculation of the moment of inertia is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the rotational partition function but not considering the vibrational part, but that's not the case because the question says it's the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy. Let me recheck that.

ΔE_vib = hbar * ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the next state as the first rotational state (J=1) for the same vibrational level, so the photon energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is 4e-20 m². So I = μ R².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Let me recompute μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20*2) / (20+2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.8*1.6605=2.9889, 0.01818 *1.6605≈0.02995, sum is ≈3.0188e-27 kg.

So I = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the question uses the mass in atomic mass units but didn't convert to kg correctly. Wait, no, because without converting, the calculations wouldn't make sense for SI units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of frequency instead of angular frequency. Oh wait, the question gives ω as 4e14 rad/s, so hbar ω is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ squared.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2.

1.0545718e-34 squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 = appr 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

1.0545718e-34 * 1.0545718e-34 = ?

1.05457e-34 *1.05457e-34 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68.

1.05457^2 is about 1.112, so yes, 1.112e-68 J² s².

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the vibrational transition, but why is that?

Because if the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options are much higher, perhaps I have a mistake in my approach.

Wait another idea: Maybe the question is asking for the photon to cause a transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (n=1, J=0) — that is, a vibrational transition. Because that might be the next possible state.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. But perhaps the problem is considering the next state in terms of vibrational excitation.

Wait, but the options are way higher than what I calculated for the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's momentum.

E_photon = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is p=1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

So why is this the case? Because perhaps the question is considering the next state as the first vibrational state, not the rotational one. But why would that be the case? Because maybe the rotation-vibration model includes both, and perhaps the molecule's next state is a vibrational state, but that's not the minimal energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model requires that the photon's energy must match the vibrational energy, not the rotational. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Wait, but perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are such that the next state after the fundamental is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. But that would be wrong because the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the rigid rotor and the non-rigid. In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, so only rotational transitions are possible. But in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, allowing for vibrational transitions.

Wait, but the question specifies the "quantum rotation-vibration model," which includes both. So the molecule can transition either way.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon must match the smallest possible energy difference. That would be the rotational transition, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But this leads to a momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the model, or perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition as the next state.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the first excited state as the first vibrational state, regardless of the energy. But that wouldn't make sense because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Another possibility is that I have a miscalculation in the rotational energy. Let me see.

Wait, maybe the rotational energy is calculated with the rotational constant B, which is ħ²/(2I), and for J=1, the energy is 2B.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the J=0 state, and the next state would be J=1, which would be the next rotational state. So the energy needed is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, as calculated.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering that the photon must be absorbed for a transition that includes both a rotational and vibrational change, but that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest, and the next state would be a vibrational state. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, another thought: Oh wait! The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state could be J=1, n=0, which is a higher energy. Alternatively, it could be J=0, n=1, which is even higher.

So the photon's energy would need to be at least the energy of the smallest possible jump.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why are the options not matching that?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's momentum. Let's see.

E_photon = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So why is this happening? Because in the problem statement, perhaps the model is such that the next state is the vibrational state, not the rotational. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, what momentum should the photon have?

Wait, perhaps the next state refers to the first excited state, which is the first state above the fundamental. But in a diatomic molecule's energy levels, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. The order of the states isn't strictly one after another; higher rotational states can have lower energy than some vibrational states.

In other words, the next state after the fundamental (n=0, J=0) could be J=1, n=0, which has higher energy than J=0, n=1. Let me see.

Wait, no: let me compute the energies numerically.

E_rot for J=1, n=0: 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib for J=0, n=1:4.2e-20 J.

So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the next state is J=1, n=0.

But according to that, the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns, not listed in the options.

So perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition, but that's a higher energy, so it's not the next state with the lowest possible energy. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia I correctly.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) in kg.

Mx =20 amu → 20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (20 *2 *1.66e-27) / (22) ) = (40 *1.66e-27) /22 = (66.4e-27)/22 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

I= μ R² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg·m².

So that's correct.

So, the rotational energy difference is 9.2e-23 J, which is smaller than the vibrational 4.2e-20 J.

Hmm. So why is the option D 1.4e-28 Ns, which corresponds to the vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think about the photon's energy again.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the photon is E = h f, where f is the frequency. But the problem gives ω as 4e14 rad/s. So ω=2πf → f=ω/(2π) = (4e14)/(6.283) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon = h f = 6.626e-34 J s *6.366e13 Hz ≈4.214e-20 J. Which matches the vibrational transition.

But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition is lower energy. So why is the photon's energy matching the vibrational?

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. But that would be incorrect because the rotational state is a lower energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition and not the rotational, but that doesn't make sense with the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, not non-rigid, but the question states it's non-rigid.

Wait, maybe I should compute the vibrational energy and see the corresponding momentum.

E_photon =4.218e-20 J → p_photon= E/c=4.218e-20 /3e8=1.406e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but according to the calculations, the rotational transition is lower energy. So why is the problem expecting the vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps the
