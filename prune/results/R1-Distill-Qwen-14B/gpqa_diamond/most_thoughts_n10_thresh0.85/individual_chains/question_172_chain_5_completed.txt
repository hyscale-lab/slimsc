Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. I remember that when dealing with stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Oh right, it's all about the Boltzmann distribution. 

So the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small region of the photosphere behaves like a perfect thermal reservoir at a single temperature.

Wait, but how does the excitation relate to temperature? I think the Boltzmann equation deals with the population of different energy levels. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in energy levels i and j, respectively. Since the energy difference is given, and assuming it's between two levels, maybe E_i - E_j is the 1.38e-23 J value.

In this case, the problem is comparing two stars, so we're probably looking at the ratio of excitation between the two stars for the same energy levels. So for star 1, the excitation (n1_i) is twice that of star 2 (n2_i), but I'm not exactly sure how that translates into the equation.

Wait, actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the population in a higher energy level (excited state) is twice that in star_2. Let's say for a specific transition, like from level j to i, where i is higher in energy.

So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) can be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the excited state as i and the lower as j. So for star 1, n1_i / n1_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T1) ). Similarly for star 2, n2_i / n2_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio n1_i / n1_j is twice that of n2_i / n2_j? Or perhaps the ratio of the populations is different.

Wait, actually, maybe it's about the ratio of the excited fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is measured relative to the ground state. Let me think. Let's model the ratio for each star.

n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated relative to star_2. So perhaps n1_i is twice n2_i? Or maybe the ratio (n_i / (n_i + n_j)) is twice for star_1 compared to star_2?

Wait, wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the fraction of excited atoms is higher in star_1. So (n1_i) / (n1_total) = twice (n2_i) / (n2_total). Hmm, but the total number of atoms is the same? Or not necessarily? Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_i) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I think it's more about the ratio of the excited to the ground state because the problem talks about specific energy levels.

Wait, maybe the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is given. So for star 1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. So:

(n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j)

But from the Boltzmann equation, (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write this equation out:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, perhaps I can take the natural logarithm on both sides.

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Let me compute that:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I don't know the value of ΔE. The problem gives it as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the value of 1.38 is close to k (Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * something. Let me compute.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T_? Wait, what's T here? Wait, not necessarily, because ΔE is given as a fixed value.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back, we have:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K.

Wait, but units? Because (T1 - T2) is in K, T1 T2 is K^2, so the ratio is 1/K.

So, ln(2) has to equal (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because the K's would cancel. So equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). That's exactly what I have.

Wait, let me double-check. I think I derived it right.

We started with the ratio of the excitation in the two stars, set up the Boltzmann equation, took the logarithm, substituted the given delta E, and ended up with option D.


To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Assuming the energy difference \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), we equate the excitation ratios for the two stars:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Substituting these into the excitation ratio equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = k\) (since \(\Delta E / k = 1\)), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
