Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps, ending up with product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3.

First, I'll break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1 and 3), heating with a base would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often pale colored.

Looking at the IR spectrum, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, but if it's elimination, wouldn't we get an alkene? Unless I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic compound. Heating with KOH in a high temperature might lead to a different reaction. Oh, maybe it's a ring-opening or a substitution. Wait, no, substitution of two bromines would give a diol. But the IR has a carbonyl, which would suggest a ketone or an ester or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but with two adjacent Br atoms, maybe forming a conjugated diene? But then where does the carbonyl come in? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms an alkoxide, which could rearrange. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base, sometimes a double elimination can occur, forming an alkene. But in this case, KOH is in excess, so perhaps it's a E2 elimination leading to the diene. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone. So perhaps the initial product is a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't a diene but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder type reaction, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in a way that maybe forms a bridge. If both bromines are on adjacent bridges, elimination would form a double bond. But would that give a carbonyl? Or maybe the base abstracts protons, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR data of product 1. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. Maybe an OCH2 group. Because in a diol, the adjacent Hs would couple, but if it's isolated, like an ether. Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's something like a ketone. Alternatively, an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide. But epoxides have different NMR shifts. The 4.79 ppm is more like an ether or an ester OCH2 group.

Wait, another thought. If the dibromide undergoes two elimination reactions, perhaps forming a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with KOH, substitution would be SN2, but in such a rigid structure as adamantane, SN2 is unlikely. So probably elimination is the way to go.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Because if two HBr molecules are eliminated, the molecule would form a ketone. Let's see: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a ketone. Oh, wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that eliminating two HBr would form a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. Wait, no. Because adamantane has bridgehead carbons, which can't have double bonds. So elimination can't form a bridgehead double bond. Therefore, perhaps the elimination occurs elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a secondary carbon, so each elimination would form a double bond there. But then, how would that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, and the leaving group (Br-) departs, leading to a carbocation. But adamantane is a very stable structure; maybe the carbocation is at a bridgehead, which is possible.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data of product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H, probably a singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, maybe all the bridgehead Hs), and 1.94 (2H, perhaps some other Hs). The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is 1,3-diketone? No, that can't be. Wait, wait. Maybe elimination leads to forming a single ketone. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, loses two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge. For example, each Br is on a secondary carbon that can lose HBr, and the elimination forms a ring. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the two Br atoms are in positions where their elimination forms a conjugated dienone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but the product is a diketone. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to two carbonyl groups. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe the product is a mono-ketone. So, for example, one Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the other Br, leading to a double elimination and formation of a ketone. Wait, but then you would have two carbonyls. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1-adamantanol, but that's an alcohol, which would have an O-H stretch in IR, but the given IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl, not an alcohol.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 is indicative of a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. Therefore, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH must form a ketone.

So, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, and when KOH abstracts a proton, the Br leaves, and the adjacent Br also leaves, leading to a conjugated system that forms a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the base induces elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination. Each Br is on a carbon that can lose HBr, leading to a double bond, but the structure might not allow it. Alternatively, perhaps the two eliminations lead to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: if the base removes a beta hydrogen, causing an E2 elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. But if there are two adjacent Brs, perhaps two such eliminations happen, leading to a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't produce a carbonyl group. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not an elimination but a substitution. But with two Brs, both substitution would lead to a diol. But the IR doesn't show OH stretch, so maybe it's not a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a glycol (diol), but the IR shows a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the NMR. The singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, maybe an OCH2 group. Then, perhaps it's a diepoxide? But epoxides typically have more downfield shifts. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid. Common light yellow solids in organic chemistry include ketones, maybe epoxides, or other carbonyl compounds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually requires peracids. KOH doesn't do that. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination. Pinacol is 1,2-diol which, when treated with acid, forms a carbonyl. But here, it's a dihalide. Hmm.

Wait, if the dihalide reacts with a base, perhaps it forms a dialkoxide, which then eliminates two equivalents of HX, leading to a ketone. But in this case, the structure would need to allow for that. So if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, perhaps the elimination leads to a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that, when eliminated, forms a carbonyl. For example, if Br is on a tertiary carbon adjacent to a bridge, losing HBr would form a carbonyl if the structure allows.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to look for similar reactions. Oh, wait, when 1,2-dibromocyclohexane is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate to form cyclohexene. But in adamantane, it's a more rigid structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr, forms a ketone. So each Br is on a carbon that loses HBr, and the two carbons become carbonyl groups? But that would form a diketone, which would have two carbonyl IR peaks, but the question says there's a characteristic absorbance at 1720. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to a single ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the initial product is a mono-bromide, but that's not the case. The starting material is di-bromo.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridges, and elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not allowed due to Bredt's rule, so maybe the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe elimination occurs in such a way that one Br leaves, forming a carbocation, and the adjacent Br leaves, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Hmm, that might be possible.

So, starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps one Br leaves as Br- (after base abstracts a proton), forming a carbocation. Then, the adjacent Br leaves, but since the carbocation is adjacent to a bridge, maybe it's not stable. Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent Br leaves, leading to the formation of a double bond, but that would not produce a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should proceed to the next step to see if that helps.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps this step is a Friedel-Crafts reaction. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. Is adamantane aromatic? No, it's an anti-aromatic compound. Wait, no, adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. But earlier, the IR doesn't show an OH stretch. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation. But again, without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: Maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR has a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a nucleophilic attack or some kind of ring expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that the NMR didn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So it's probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

So, maybe after the first step, we have a ketone.

Then, in step 2, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What reaction would that cause? If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enol ether formation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening polymerization, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is an ester, but the IR at 1720 could fit that as well. But then, Al isopropoxide could act as a catalyst for some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and step 2 is an acid-catalyzed elimination. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it could dehydrate the diol to form an alkene. But then, why would product 2 be needed for the next step?

Wait, product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

Wait, that suggests that product 2 has a double bond. So, let's recap:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (IR shows C=O,
