Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound using spectroscopy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that different spectroscopic techniques give different kinds of information. Let's break down each piece of data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh right, broad peaks in IR are usually from O-H stretches because they involve hydrogen bonds or are in alcohols, maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol or maybe an amine, but I don't think amines would be in the options here. Looking at the other peaks, there are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) group. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester, or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But wait, 1650 is a bit lower than a typical C=O stretch. Oh wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide? But looking at the options, the oxygen count might help later.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably an alkene. That points towards something like an ester or maybe a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

Now the mass spectrum: there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Well, 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2O, which is the fragment from diethyl ether or maybe a hemiacetal. Wait, alternatively, the molecular ion could break into a smaller fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group splits off, and part of it is 45. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group with something attached.

Let's consider the possible formulas:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation for each to see which makes sense.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one double bond or ring.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two double bonds or one ring plus one double bond, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (14 -10 +0)/2 → (14-10)/2 = 2. So same as B: two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU = (14 -12)/2 = 1.

Wait, the ¹H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. That's one DoU. So the other DoU could be from another double bond or from an oxygen-containing group, like an ester (which has a carbonyl and an ether group, but I'm not sure how that contributes. Or maybe a carbonyl and a ring? Let's think.

The IR has a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl group. So that's another DoU (the C=O). So the total DoU is at least 2 (assuming one from the C=O and one from the alkene). So the formula must have a DoU of at least 2. Let's check the options:

A: DoU=1 → Not enough.
B: DoU=2 → Yes.
C: DoU=2 → Yes.
D: DoU=1 → Not enough.

So A and D can be eliminated because they only have one DoU, but we have at least two (one from C=O, one from alkene). So the possible options are B and C.

So now, between B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2).

The IR has two peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is probably a carbonyl group. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like an aromatic ring would absorb around 1500-1600), but if the compound doesn't have an aromatic ring, then maybe another carbonyl or an ester group. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Looking at the mass spec: m/z=45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

If the fragment is 45, which is 45 amu. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether?), which is 45. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetate group (CH3COO-), which has a molecular weight of 60. Hmm, but wait, maybe in the mass spec, the fragment is a part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule cleaves into an acetyl group (CH3COO) would contribute 45? Wait, the acetyl group is (CH3CO), which is 43. Hmm, maybe not.

Another possibility: the 45 could be from a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester. Let's think about the molecular formula. If it's C6H10O2, it could be an ester with two oxygen atoms. For example, methyl something ester. Let's think about possible structures.

Let's think about the IR. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is likely O-H, but wait, if it's an ester, the O-H from an alcohol would have been used in the esterification. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. So the broad peak must be from something else. Oh wait, maybe it's an acid. Wait, but the options with O2 include C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000. But looking at the options, if the formula is C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. A carboxylic acid would have a formula of CnH2nO2. For n=3, it's C3H6O2 (like propanoic acid). Wait, n=3 is C3H6O2, but our compound is C6H10O2. Hmm, that's larger. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but then the O-H wouldn't be present. So perhaps the broad peak isn't an O-H from an alcohol or acid.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H. Maybe it's an alcohol. So looking back, the options with O in the formula.

Wait, if the compound is an alcohol, it would have an O-H stretch. But the options with O are B (C6H10O), which is an alcohol (DoU 2), and C (C6H10O2), which could be an ester or acid.

Wait, but the IR also shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So if the compound is an alcohol, that would require another carbonyl group, which would make it something like a ketone or aldehyde. But alcohols plus ketones would have a higher DoU.

Wait, let's think again. The IR peaks: 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650. And the broad peak at 3000. So perhaps the compound has both an O-H group (like an alcohol) and a carbonyl group (like a ketone). So the structure might be a carbonyl group and an alcohol group. For example, a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group.

Alternatively, the broad peak could be from an aromatic ring with O-H, like phenol. But I don't think the options include a phenol. Let's check the options. The options are C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc. Phenol would be C6H5OH, which is C6H6O. But our options don't have that.

Another thought: the broad peak at 3000 could be an O-H from an ester, but no, esters don't have O-H. Wait, maybe it's an acetylenic O-H, but that's uncommon. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an amide. But the options don't include nitrogen, so that's probably not it.

Wait, if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. But in that case, the IR would show peaks for both.

But let's circle back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at 45: maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is the mass, but the molecular formula is either C6H10O (MW 98) or C6H10O2 (114). So the fragment 45 is smaller than the molecular ion, so it's a product of the molecule breaking apart.

What if the compound is an ester? Let's say the formula is C6H10O2. An ester would have the structure R-O-C-O-R', which would contribute two oxygen atoms. The IR would show the carbonyl at around 1700 cm⁻¹. The ester group doesn't have an O-H, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the ester is conjugated to a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but then why the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹? Hmm, that's confusing because esters don't have O-H. Unless I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol ester or something else. Or perhaps the broad peak is from something else, like an alcohol group elsewhere.

Wait, let me think about the options.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond. For example, cyclohexene with an alcohol group. So a cyclohexene ring with an -OH. The IR would show a broad O-H around 3300, but wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower. Oh, maybe it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, which has a broader but lower wavenumber.

But then, the IR at 1700 would be a carbonyl group, which would require another group. Wait, if the formula is C6H10O, that would be DoU 2, but that would mean either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. If it's a cyclohexene (one ring, one double bond) but where's the carbonyl group?

Wait, maybe if the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let me think. A lactone is an ester, so would have the carbonyl. But the formula for a lactone would be C6H10O2, which is option C. Oh, but I'm considering option B here, which is C6H10O. So maybe option B is not a lactone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The mass spec: m/z=45. Let's think about possible functional groups that would give a 45 fragment.

One possibility is a fragment from an ester. For example, an ethyl acetate would have the structure CH3COOCH2CH3. Its molecular weight is 88. If it breaks apart, the fragment could be the acetate part (CH3COO, which is 60) or maybe a smaller part. Wait, but 45 is less than that.

Another possibility: the fragment could be an ethyl group (29), but that's not 45. Wait, 45 is 45 amu. Let's think of the possible combinations.

45 can be CH2O (formaldehyde group?), but that's 30. Or perhaps (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15*3=45). So that's a fragment of (CH3)2O. If the molecule breaks to form that. So if the original compound has a (CH2) group connected to something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58. If it breaks, maybe a fragment at 45?

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a C3H6O group, which would be 58 (12*3 +6 +16=58). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, the general formula for an ester is CnH2nO2. Let's see: n=3 would be C3H6O2 → molecular weight 86. Our option is C6H10O2. So the ester would have a formula like R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. Suppose R is ethyl (C2H5) and R' is another group.

Wait, maybe the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the compound could be a diketone, but that's less likely because that would require two carbonyl groups, which would give different IR peaks.

Wait, the IR has two strong peaks: 1700 and 1650. So maybe two carbonyls, but that's not typical for an ester. Ester has one carbonyl. So if there's another peak at 1650, perhaps it's from an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has an ester group and a conjugated double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such as CH2=CHCOOR. The conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹. That could explain the two peaks in IR.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the IR would show a strong peak at ~1700 (ester carbonyl) and a peak around 1650 (conjugated double bond). The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ would be confusing because esters don't have O-H. So where does that come from? Maybe it's an internal hydrogen somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups. So a peak at 1700 and one at 1650. But beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula for a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3, but our options don't have that many oxygens. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700, and the broad peak could be from an internal hydrogen if the structure has an alcohol group, but that's not the case for a lactone.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl
