Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so the formula they're using is Number of stars proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1 / distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So they're asking about the number per unit distance. I think they're referring to the density or maybe the count per some range of distance.

Let me think. The number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And since plx is 1/d, where d is distance, I can substitute that in. So 1/(plx)^5 = 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Maybe that's talking about the differential number, like how many stars are there in an infinitesimal shell at distance d with thickness dr. So that would be the number per unit distance interval.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the number per unit volume or something else. Let me clarify. 

Let's think in terms of a volume. The number of stars in a region might depend on how much volume is accessible given the distance. But wait, the question is about the number varying with parallax, not directly with distance. Wait, the given relation is N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d, so 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, what's the relationship between the number of stars and distance? If N increases as d^5, that would mean that as you go further, the number of stars increases rapidly. But that doesn't quite make sense because as you go further, the density of stars might decrease since they're spread out more. Or maybe in this specific region, the number actually depends invers
