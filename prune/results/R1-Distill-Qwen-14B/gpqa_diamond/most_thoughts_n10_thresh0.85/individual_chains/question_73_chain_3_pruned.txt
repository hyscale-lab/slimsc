Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity formulas.

First, I think about the relative speed part. Oh wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two velocities like in classical physics. Right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is [v1 - v2] divided by [1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)]. Oh wait, but wait: which astronaut's frame are we considering? Oh, right, the question asks for the relative speed of one with respect to the other. So perhaps we can assume one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c. So let's say the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the first's perspective, what's the speed of the second? Or vice versa?

Wait, wait. Wait, no: because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative velocity would be the difference of their speeds, but adjusted relativistically. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The formula is for the relative velocity when one frame is moving at velocity u relative to another. So if the two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1*u2)/(c²)). Or is it (u2 - u1)? Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The correct formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. Suppose object A is moving at velocity v_A and object B at velocity v_B, both in the same direction. The relative velocity of B with respect to A is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)) )? Or is it (v_A - v_B) divided by that denominator? Wait, no. Let me think. The velocity of B in the frame of A is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, and if v_B is greater than
