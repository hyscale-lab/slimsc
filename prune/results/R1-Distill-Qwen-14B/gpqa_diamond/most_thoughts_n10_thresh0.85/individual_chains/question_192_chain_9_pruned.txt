Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about electric fields and conductors. Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So imagine a sphere, and inside it, a smaller sphere-shaped hole not at the center but shifted by s units away.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor and l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, what's the setup again? Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. I remember something about conductors and charges in cavities. Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall.

So the cavity has charge +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must then have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. But the conductor as a whole remains neutral, so the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q, and conductor's total charge is zero. Wait no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So the cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor itself was neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q.

But how does this affect the electric field at a point outside the conductor? Well, the point P is outside the conductor (since L > R), so the electric field there would be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. But wait, the outer surface charge is +q, but where is it located?

Wait, the conductor is a sphere, and the charge on a conductor's outer surface distributes in such a way that the field outside is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That
