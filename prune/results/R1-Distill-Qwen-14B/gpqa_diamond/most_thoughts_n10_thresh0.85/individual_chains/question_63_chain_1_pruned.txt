Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give some parameters: mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is probably the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0 or J=1? Wait, no, J can't be zero for a diatomic because of the way rotational energy works. Wait, no, J can be zero, but for a rigid rotor model, the energy levels are (J(J+1))ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia).

Wait, but the problem says it's a non-rigid rotor model, which I think also includes vibrational energy. Hmm, maybe I should think about the energy levels for a diatomic molecule when considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, what's the next state after the fundamental? Oh, right, in the rotation-vibration model, the next state could involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state. Since the photon is being absorbed, it's probably an excitation, so the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next higher state.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid rotor or not). Wait, what's the ground state J value? For a diatomic, the rotational quantum number J starts at 0, but for the rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But in the non-rigid model, maybe it's a bit different, but
