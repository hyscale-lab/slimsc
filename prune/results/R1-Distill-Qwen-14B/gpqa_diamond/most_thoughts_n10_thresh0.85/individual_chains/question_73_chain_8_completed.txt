Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, the options are A to D. I'll need to calculate both the relative speed and the total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just subtract the speeds normally because that's what you'd do in classical mechanics, and it doesn't hold at high velocities. So, the relative speed formula must involve the Lorentz factor, I think. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is a bit tricky. Right, the formula is:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2))

Wait, but wait, that's when both are moving in the same direction. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, their speeds are in the same direction. So, v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging in:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) 

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel =0.14c. So the first part narrows it down to C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Wait, wait, no, wait. The total energy of each astronaut is their rest mass energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor. So each one's energy is gamma * m c².

Wait, but the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So for each, we calculate their gamma, multiply by their mass, and sum the energies.

So for the first astronaut:

v = 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So v²/c² is (0.36c²)/c² =0.36. 1 - 0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

His energy is gamma * mass *c². Mass is 2m, so 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut, v=0.5c.

v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= about 0.8660 (since sqrt(3)/2 is about that). So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547.

His mass is 3m, so energy is 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈3 *1.1547 mc² ≈3.464 mc².

Total energy is the sum: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower, so D is not correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is the sum of their rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy, given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy of the system is \(E \approx 5.96mc^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
