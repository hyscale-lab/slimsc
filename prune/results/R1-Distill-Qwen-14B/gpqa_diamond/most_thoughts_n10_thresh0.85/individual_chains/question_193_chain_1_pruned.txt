Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula given is number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance is that distance d is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in parsecs. Oh right, d (parsecs) = 1 / plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. 

So the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me break it down. 

Let me write down what I know. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ). That simplifies to N ∝ d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. 

Wait, but the question asks about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe I need to think about how N changes as r (distance) increases. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. 

But wait, the options are in terms of r. Oh wait, r is the distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then in a unit range, like from r to r+1, how does the number of stars change? Hmm, maybe I should think about the differential. 

Wait, perhaps I should model this mathematically. Let's say N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, N ∝ (d)^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if I have a small change in distance dr, how does the number of stars change? That would be dN/dr, the derivative.

dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are expressions in terms of r. Oh wait, wait. Wait, maybe I
