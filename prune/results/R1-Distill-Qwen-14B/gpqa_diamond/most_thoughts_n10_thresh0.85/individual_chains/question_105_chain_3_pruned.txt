Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the light curve, similar to an exoplanet transit. Interesting.

Alright, the star has the same radius as the Sun. So R_star is R_sun, which I remember is about 7e5 km or 696,000 km. But maybe I don't need the exact number right away.

The star's hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% means 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots. Oh wait, but since it's one hemisphere, does that affect the total area? Let me think. The star's total surface area is 4πR². If spots are on one hemisphere, which is 2πR², so the total spotty area would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But maybe I should think in terms of the entire star's surface when calculating the brightness variation.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K, but does that mean the spots are 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, dark spots are cooler, right? So the spots must be 5000 K. Because 6000K is the star's effective temp, and spots are cooler by 1000K.

So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the rotational period will modulate the brightness. As the spots rotate in and out, the total brightness we observe changes. This is similar to the situation when a planet transits in front of a star, blocking some light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what planet radius (relative to the star) would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star would, assuming the star wasn't spotted but a planet was transiting. So without the spots, to get the same brightness variation as with the spots, what's the planet's radius ratio?

I think the approach is to calculate the relative change in brightness for both cases and set them equal. Then solve for R_planet / R_star.

First, let's model the brightness variation when the spots are present. Each spot is cooler, so when it's facing us, it contributes less light. The total brightness is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness.

But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to spots can be compared to an exoplanet transit. So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation (the change in flux) is the same in both cases.

So, I need to calculate the change in flux due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change when it transits.

Let's break it down.

The star's total flux without spots is L = 4π R_star² σ Teff⁴. But when spots are present, the flux is less. The flux from the star when spots are present would be L_total = L_unspotted + L_spots.

The unspotted area is (1 - filling factor) of the hemisphere. Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So total spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The flux from the unspotted regions is (1 - 0.2) * (area of hemisphere) * σ Teff⁴ per unit area. Wait, no, because the star's entire surface emits flux. When part of it is cooler, that part contributes less.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when spots are present.

The flux without any spots would be F0 = σ Teff^4. The star emits F0 per unit area. The average flux when spots are present is F_avg = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f, where f is the filling factor, but this might not be accurate because the spots are only on one hemisphere. Hmm, maybe I should think about the total flux from the star.

Wait, the star is a sphere. The total flux without spots is F_total = 4π R² σ Teff⁴. Now, when spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux change can be calculated.

The area of the spots is A_spots = f * 2π R², where f is the filling factor (0.2). Each spot's temperature is T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the flux from the spots is F_spots = A_spots * σ (T_spot)^4.
The flux from the unspotted areas is F_unspots = (2π R² - A_spots) * σ Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because the entire star's surface is 4π R². But the spots are only on one hemisphere, which is 2π R². So the area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of that hemisphere (80%) plus the other hemisphere (all of it) is at Teff.

Wait, no. The other hemisphere is spot-free, right? Because the problem says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the other hemisphere has no spots.

So the entire star's surface is:

- Spotted area: 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² (since hemisphere is 2π R²)
- Unspotted area
