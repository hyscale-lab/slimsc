Okay, so I've got this question here about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The possible answers are combinations of these, labeled A to D.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories are constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually the Planck scale or something like that. These operators are organized by their dimension, so they're dimension 6, 8, etc.

Now, when you write down these operators, you have to respect the symmetries of the original Standard Model, right? Because SMEFT is an extension that maintains the same symmetries as the SM, just with additional terms. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So what are the symmetries of the Standard Model?

The Standard Model has several symmetries. The gauge group is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but that's more about the interactions rather than global symmetries. For global symmetries, the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Then there are internal symmetries like chiral symmetry, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the symmetries that all operators must respect. So all the operators in the SMEFT must be compatible with the symmetries that the SM respects. So which of the given symmetries are that.

Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely one. Because the SM is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT can't violate Lorentz symmetry because that's a fundamental aspect of how the theory works in relativity.

Poincare symmetry (2) includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, the effective theory is built in a way that the renormalizable terms (like the SM) are part of it, but higher-dimension terms are added. The SM includes Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Because if you have a term that breaks Poincare, the
