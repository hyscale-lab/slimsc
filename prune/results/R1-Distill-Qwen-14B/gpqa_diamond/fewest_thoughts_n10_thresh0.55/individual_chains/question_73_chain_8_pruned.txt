Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if you're on a train moving at 0.8c and you throw a ball at 0.9c, the speed of the ball relative to the ground isn't simply 1.7c, because that would exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula here.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I got that right. Oh wait, actually, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when one object is moving at v1 and the other at v2 in the same direction. So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. Wait, but wait—no, wait. The problem says they're
