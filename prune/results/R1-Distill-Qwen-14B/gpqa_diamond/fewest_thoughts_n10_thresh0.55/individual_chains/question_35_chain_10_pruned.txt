Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Right, I remember that to find eigenvalues, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But before that, maybe I should write down the matrix Ay. Let's compute it. The matrix S is given as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                 [i, 0]]

Let me compute each element:

The (1,1) element is 0, so multiplied by c it's 0.

(1,2) element is -i * c. So that's (-i h)/(4π).

Similarly, (2,1) is i * c → (i h)/(4π), and (2,2) is 0.

So Ay looks like:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of Ay - λ I, where I is the identity matrix.

So,

|Ay - λ I| = | -λ      (-i h)/(4π)      |
             |(i h)/(4π)   -λ      |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ]

Calculating each part:

(-λ)^2 = λ^2.

The off-diagonal term product is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)).

Wait, let me compute that. i times (-i) is -i^
