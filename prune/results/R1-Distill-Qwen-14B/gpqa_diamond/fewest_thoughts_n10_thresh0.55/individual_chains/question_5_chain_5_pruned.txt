Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so I think it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these components is given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0,1] in the first row and [1,0] in the second. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with [0, -i] and [i, 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1,0; 0,-1]. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the plane spanned by x and z axes. So the direction can be represented by some angle, maybe theta from the z-axis or something. Since it's arbitrary, perhaps the eigenvector depends on that direction. But the problem is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. 

Hmm, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along n would be P·n̂, where n̂ is a unit vector in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n̂ can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, actually, by convention, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so yes, that would make sense.

So, the operator in question is P·n̂ = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n̂ = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. 

Wait, but n_x is sinθ because n is in x-z. Let me think: if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the x-component is sinθ, and z is cosθ. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator along n is P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Since n is arbitrary in x-z, the components
