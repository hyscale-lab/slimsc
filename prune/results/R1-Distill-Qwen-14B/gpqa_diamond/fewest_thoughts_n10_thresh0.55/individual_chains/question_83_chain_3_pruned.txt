Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So first, let me understand what's given.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, okay. So the first part is the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the pH at equivalence. 

I remember that for weak acids being titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region because the conjugate base of the weak acid will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

First, let's figure out the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. 

Original volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. 

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

But wait, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. 

At 25% titration, meaning 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's find out how much NaOH is added at that point.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the equivalence point first. Because the equivalence point will tell me how much NaOH is needed to completely neutralize the acetic acid.

So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. So to reach equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be the same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume (in L) = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. 

Wait, but wait, I should check if the 25% is of the initial volume or the equivalence volume. Hmm, no, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So before any titration, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, let's calculate the concentrations of the species in the solution.

Wait, but wait, when we add NaOH to acetic acid, the reaction is: 

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O

So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^-.

So let's calculate the moles after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M
