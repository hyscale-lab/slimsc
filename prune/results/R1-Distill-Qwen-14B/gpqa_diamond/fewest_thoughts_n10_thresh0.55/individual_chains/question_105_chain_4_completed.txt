Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, the brightness changes as the star rotates, which they observe. But the problem says this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the brightness variations. They want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots.

Hmm, so when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star, right? So the formula I remember is that the relative flux change (ΔF/F) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation when the star rotates. So the brightness change isn't just a simple dip; it's more of a modulation over time. But the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we're comparing the maximum dip caused by the planet to the maximum dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about the spots first. The star has a radius R = R_sun. One hemisphere is spotted, with 20% coverage. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. Wait, but wait, because when the star rotates, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So the total area of the star's surface is 4πR², and one hemisphere is the area we see, which is 2πR².

The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so area = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, that's the total spot area. But each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. So when the spots are facing us, they contribute less flux than the rest of the star.

The brightness variation would be due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is in front of us. But wait, the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R². Wait, another way: the hemisphere is 2πr², 20% of that is 0.4π r².

Now, the total flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR². Wait, but when a fraction of the surface is cooler, the total flux becomes F = F0 * (1 - (ΔF/F0)), where ΔF is the difference due to spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the change in flux when the spots are present. The spots are cooler, so their contribution is less. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star's total flux decreases.

Let me calculate the flux change when the spots are fully visible. The flux from the star is normally F = σTeff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²), but for relative changes, the D (distance) will cancel out. So the total flux without spots is F0 = σ T^4 * (4π R²).

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (Teff^4) * (4π R² - A * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4) ) ] * σ ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the contribution of the spotted area compared to the rest. The unspotted area contributes more flux.

The unspotted part of the hemisphere (which is 80% of it) has a flux of (4π R² * (1 - 0.2)) * (Teff^4) * σ.

The spotted part contributes (0.2 * 2π R²) * (T_spot^4) * σ, where T_spot is Teff - 1000 = 5000 K.

Wait, but the hemisphere we're seeing is 2π R², so the unspotted part is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R². The spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. The spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the other hemisphere is not spotted. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered in spots, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the maximum dip in flux when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us. So the star's total flux comes from all areas. But when the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of the flux is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum change in brightness occurs when all the spots are on the side we can see. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible.

So the total flux without spots is F0 = σ T^4 * (4 π R²) / (4π D²) ), but D cancels out.

When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is F = (unspotted area flux + spotted area flux).

The unspotted area is the other hemisphere plus the unspotted part of the visible hemisphere. Wait, no. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One is spotted (20% coverage), the other is unspotted.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, no, because each hemisphere is opposite. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the other is not. So the total flux is:

Flux = (Flux from unspotted hemisphere) + (Flux from spotted hemisphere's unspotted part).

The unspotted hemisphere is 100% unspotted, so area 2 π R².

The spotted hemisphere has 20% spotted, so 80% unspotted. So area of unspotted part is 0.8*(2 π R²) = 1.6 π R².

Wait, no. The spotted hemisphere is the one where 20% is spots. So the unspotted part of that hemisphere is 80% of 2 π R², which is 1.6 π R².

So the total unspotted area when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

Unspotted hemisphere (2 π R²) + unspotted part of spotted hemisphere (1.6 π R²) = 3.6 π R².

But wait, the total surface area of the star is 4 π R². The spotted hemisphere has 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R² spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots are blocking some flux.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

When the spotted hemisphere is not visible (the other hemisphere is visible), the flux is F0 = σ T^4 * (4 π R²) / (4 π D²) = σ T^4 R² / D².

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = (unspotted areas) * T^4 + (spotted areas) * T_spot^4.

So let's compute F when the spotted hemisphere is visible:

Unspotted hemisphere: 2 π R² * T^4.

Spotted hemisphere's unspotted part: (0.8)(2 π R²) * T^4.

Spotted spots: (0.2)(2 π R²) * (T-1000)^4.

Wait, no. The spotted hemisphere is being viewed, so the unspotted part of that hemisphere is 0.8*(2 π R²), and the spotted part is 0.2*(2 π R²).

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F = [ (unspotted hemisphere: 2 π R²) * T^4 + (spotted hemisphere's unspotted part: 0.8*2 π R²)*T^4 + (spotted part: 0.2*2 π R²)*T_spot^4 ] 

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is on the back, so the front is the spotted hemisphere. So the front has 0.8*(2 π R²) unspotted and 0.2*(2 π R²) spotted. The back hemisphere (unspotted) is not visible, so it doesn't contribute to our observed flux.

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F = [unspotted part of the front hemisphere] * T^4 + [spotted part of front hemisphere] * T_spot^4.

So unspotted front part is 0.8 * 2 π R² = 1.6 π R².

Spotted part is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F = (1.6 π R² * T^4) + (0.4 π R² * T_spot^4)

Without any spots, the flux would be F0 = 4 π R² * T^4.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere isn't visible (the other hemisphere is), the flux is 2 π R² * T^4 (unspotted hemisphere) because the front is the unspotted.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum fluxes.

Wait, no, the question says that the spots cause a variation in brightness. So the maximum dip would be when the maximum amount of spotted area is blocking, i.e., when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view. But wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spotted areas are in front, but the rest of the star is either unspotted or the other hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the change in flux when the spots are visible compared to when the spots are not visible.

The maximum dip would be when the maximum amount of spotted area is blocking the star's light. So the dip is the difference between the full star (no spots) and the situation when the spots are visible.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, their effect on flux is zero, because we don't see them. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (so the spots are on the back, not affecting the flux). The minimum flux is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, but only the spotted parts are cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the spotted area is fully in front. So the dip is the difference between the flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to compute the fractional change in flux.

The flux without any spots (F0) would be if the entire star is at T=6000 K. So F0 = σ T^4 * (4 π R^2) / (4 π D^2) ), but the distance D cancels out when considering relative changes.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (unspotted area) * T^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ].

But the unspotted area is the area not covered by spots. The total area of the star is 4 π R². When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the area we see is 2 π R². Of that, 0.2 is spotted, 0.8 is unspotted.

So F = (0.8 * 2 π R²) * T^4 + (0.2 * 2 π R²) * T_spot^4.

So F = 1.6 π R² T^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

The flux without any spots when the hemisphere we're viewing is unspotted is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2 π R² T^4. 

Wait, but if the star wasn't spotted, the flux from any hemisphere would just be T^4 times the area. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_unspotted = 2 π R² T^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = 1.6 π R² T^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted, which is less than F_unspotted. So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, no. The dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted. So ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² T^4 - [1.6 π R² T^4 + 0.4 π R² (T-1000)^4 ].

That simplifies to ΔF = (2 - 1.6) π R² T^4 - 0.4 π R² (T-1000)^4.

Which is 0.4 π R² [ T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ].

So the relative change is ΔF / F_unspotted.

ΔF / F_unspotted = [0.4 π R² (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] / [ 2 π R² T^4 ]

The R² and π cancel out.

So ΔF / F = [0.4 (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] / (2 T^4 )

Which simplifies to 0.2 [ (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] / T^4.

Let me compute that.

Given T = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute T = 6000, T-1000 =5000.

Compute T^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16 (exact value: 6^4 = 1296, so 6e3)^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15? Wait, 6e3^4 is (6)^4 * 1e12 → 1296 * 1e12 → 1.296e15.

Similarly, (5000)^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So T^4 = 1.296e15, T_spot^4 = 6.25e14.

So T^4 - T_spot^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Now, ΔF/F = 0.2 * (6.71e14) / (1.296e15) )

Compute 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = approx 0.5176.

So ΔF/F ≈ 0.2 * 0.5176 ≈ 0.1035.

Wait, 0.2 * 0.5176 is about 0.1035, so 10.35% dip.

So the brightness variation due to the spots is about a 10% change in flux.

Now, the planet transit would cause a dip of (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we set (R_planet / R_sun)^2 ≈ 0.1035.

Taking the square root, R_planet / R_sun ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So R_planet ≈ 0.3217 R_sun.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Details:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).  
   - Effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered by dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, and the spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.  
   - The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).  
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F = \left( 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right) + \left( 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right),
     \]
     where \( 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the unspotted part of the visible hemisphere, and \( 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the spotted part.  
   - The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is \( F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).  
   - The change in flux is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F.
     \]

3. **Relative Flux Change**:  
   Substituting the values, the relative flux change is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
   \]
   Using \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), compute:  
   \[
   T_{\text{eff}}^4 = 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}, \quad T_{\text{spot}}^4 = 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14}.
   \]
   \[
   T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14}.
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1035 \, (10.35\% \, \text{dip}).
   \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Signal**:  
   The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{star}}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
   \]
   Setting the dip caused by the exoplanet equal to the dip caused by the spots (\( 0.1035 \)):  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035.
   \]
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
