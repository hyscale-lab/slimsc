Okay, so I have this question in front of me about general relativity or differential geometry, I'm not exactly sure. But the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2, given a specific metric. Hmm.

Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that's a term related to hyperbolic geometry. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Unlike a regular sphere which has positive curvature, a pseudosphere has negative curvature, so its geometry is hyperbolic.

The metric given is ds² equals 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Interesting. So the metric is in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me write that down:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

I think this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's describing some kind of surface embedded in higher dimensions or perhaps a 2D space. Wait, pseudosphere is a 2D surface, so this should be the induced metric on it.

I need to find the area of this pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but the options don't have numbers, they have expressions involving x² and y². Wait, that's confusing. Or is r=2 given as the radius parameter, and perhaps the area is a constant?

Wait, let me think about the metric. The form looks like it's conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element in this metric would be computed by integrating the determinant of the metric over the surface.

In 2D, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric is diagonal here, so determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So sqrt of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but how do I find the total area? I have to integrate dA over the region where the metric is defined. So first, I need to find the domain of x and y.

The denominator is 4 - x² - y². For the metric to be real and non-singular, the denominator must be positive. Because 4 - x² - y² must not be zero,
