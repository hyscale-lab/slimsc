Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem gives me a state vector |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that means they form the basis for our state. 

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, I should think about what this operator looks like.

Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, the basis states are |up> and |down>, so the matrix is 2x2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Is that right? Because for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, the elements are non-zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. 

I think this operator is the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply it by ħ/2, we get exactly this matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates along the x-axis.

But wait, when measuring an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are given by the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate in the state vector.

But wait, the given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, I need to find the actual state vector by normalizing it.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state |alpha> is proportional to that, so let's compute the norm. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i). Because when you have a state
