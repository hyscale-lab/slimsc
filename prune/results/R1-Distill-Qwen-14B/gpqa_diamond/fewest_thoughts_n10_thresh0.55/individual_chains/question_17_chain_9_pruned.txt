Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So when they say the solution has 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, that means the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M.

Wait, the problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh right, the formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

So the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the complex is already formed, right? So we have to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

Let me think. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. We can assume that the dissociation of the complex is negligible because Kf is so large. Or wait, no, because Kf is large, the complex is stable, meaning that it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be very low.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, perhaps I can rearrange the Kf equation to solve for [Ca^2+]?

Let me write down the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in a solution where the only source of EDTA is the complex, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, considering that the complex has a high Kf, the free EDTA might be negligible compared to the complex. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the amount of free EDTA and free Ca^2+ are so small that the concentration of the complex is approximately equal to the initial concentration added. So [CaEDTA^2-] â‰ˆ 0.02 M.

But wait, we need to find [Ca^2+
