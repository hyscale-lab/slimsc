Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read through the question again carefully.

Alright, the operator is P, and it's for a muon. They're asking about the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to their components.

The components of the operator P are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Oh right, because spin-½ systems are represented by 2x2 matrices.

Let me note down the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. Oh wait, no, in this case, the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because the x-z plane implies y-component is zero.

But wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be P·n. So the operator in question is P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

But wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for an eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Hmm, but the problem is, I don't know what the direction n is. It's arbitrary but in x-z. So perhaps the eigenvector's form will depend on θ, the angle in the x-z plane direction.

Wait, but the question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options given are various expressions, some with square roots and sines and cosines, and some with ħ, but looking at the options, some have hbar in the elements
