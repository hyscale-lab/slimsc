Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. They mention that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Wait, so the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? Because in LTE, the Boltzmann distribution applies. So this ratio depends on temperature, the statistical weights (g factors), and the energy difference between the two levels.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, the effective temperature changes. But the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? Wait, but the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff drops. So the average Teff of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. Hmm, but maybe the effective temperature here is the overall temperature, so the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average temperature is lower because of the spots. But in the photosphere, the spots are cooler regions. So for the star as a whole, the effective temperature is the average, but when spots are present, some parts are cooler
