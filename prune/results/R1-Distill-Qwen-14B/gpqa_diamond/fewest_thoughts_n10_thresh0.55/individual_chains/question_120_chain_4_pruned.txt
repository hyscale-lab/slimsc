Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are various inverse power laws of parallax. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (pl) is inversely proportional to distance: pl = 1/distance.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—I think that might mean that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Parallax relates to distance. So if stars are spread out uniformly, as you go further away, you're covering more volume, but the number per unit volume is the same. So I need to find how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on the parallax.

Let me recall: The parallax in radians is pl = 1/d, where d is the distance. So the distance is d = 1/pl.

If I consider a small range of parallax, say from pl to pl + dpl, I want to find how many stars are there per unit pl around that pl. Or maybe it's the number per unit volume in pl space.

Wait, actually, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's like, for a given pl, how many stars have parallax in a small interval dpl around pl. But since the distance d is 1/pl, the number of stars depends on the volume as a function of pl.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

What's dV in terms of distance? Well, in spherical shells, the volume element is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by dd.

But wait, here we're dealing with parallax, not distance. Since d = 1/pl, then dd is the derivative of d with respect to pl. Let me compute that: dd/dpl = -1/(pl²). So dd = -dpl/(pl²). But since we're dealing with positive ranges, maybe
