Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with various values.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance in crystals is calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos terms... No, wait, maybe it's different for rhombohedral systems.

Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral has all edges equal and all angles equal too. So maybe there's an adjusted formula for that.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the axes. And since all angles are 30 degrees here, cos(30) is √3/2, which is approximately 0.866.

Wait, let me get the exact formula right. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_h
