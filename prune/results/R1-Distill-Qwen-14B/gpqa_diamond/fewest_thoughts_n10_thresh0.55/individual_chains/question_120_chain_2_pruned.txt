Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star. But the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax.

The options are given as different power laws. So I need to find the functional form of N as a function of plx. N is the number per unit plx.

Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then their number density is constant. But when we observe them, due to the geometry of the parallax, the distribution in terms of parallax won't be uniform.

Wait, wait. Parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by p = 1/d (in arcseconds and parsecs). So d = 1/p. As p increases, d decreases, so stars are closer.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number per volume is the same. So the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to r² dr (because surface area is 4πr² and thickness dr, but for number, it's n * volume, which is n * 4π r² dr, assuming n is uniform).

But how does this translate into parallax? Let's see. Since p
