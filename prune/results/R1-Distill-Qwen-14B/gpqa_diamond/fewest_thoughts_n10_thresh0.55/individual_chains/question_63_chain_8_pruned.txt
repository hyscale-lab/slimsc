Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be treated as vibrating dipoles, and their energy states involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule absorbs a photon, and this changes its state to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state? Is it the next vibrational state, the next rotational state, or a combination?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh right, in quantum systems, transitions are usually considered in terms of the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the selection rules for vibrational and rotational states are different. For vibrations, typically Δv = ±1, but since we're starting from the ground state, the photon would cause a transition to v=1. But for rotation, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, so if the molecule is in J=0, it can go to J=1.

But wait, the problem says it's modeled with the rotation-vibration model. So I think the energy levels are a combination of both. So the
