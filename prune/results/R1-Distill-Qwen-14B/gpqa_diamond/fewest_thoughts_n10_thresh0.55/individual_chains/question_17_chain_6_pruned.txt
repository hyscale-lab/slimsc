Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has a 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. The given formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, I think the formation constant is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. 

So, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. I think this involves understanding how much the complex dissociates. If the K is really large, like 5e10, that suggests that the complex doesn't break down much, so the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

Let me think about the dissociation. The reaction should be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait, in solution, the total concentration of EDTA includes both the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. But since the K is so large, the majority of EDTA is in the complex form, right?
