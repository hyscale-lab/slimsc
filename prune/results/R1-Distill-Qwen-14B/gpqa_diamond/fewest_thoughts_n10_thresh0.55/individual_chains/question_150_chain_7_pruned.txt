Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see what that could be. The NMR data might help me figure out the structure.

The NMR data shows peaks at 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Then there's a peak at 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a pair of doublets, which could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling constants would suggest that. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents where each pair of protons is equivalent, like a para-substituted group.

Another peak at 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet... Hmm, maybe that's an -OCH2- group or something else. Or perhaps it's a vinylic proton, but I'm not sure. Wait, the aldehyde at 9.72 suggests maybe a conjugated system. Like an enal or something.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's more like an OCH2 group. Maybe an ether or an ester? Or perhaps a benzyl group attached to an oxygen.

Putting this together: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be two benzene rings (each is 4, total 8, but wait, wait. Wait, each benzene is 3 degrees (because each ring is 3), but wait, the formula is for a benzene ring (C6H6): 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens. So for C6H6, degrees are (2*6 +2
