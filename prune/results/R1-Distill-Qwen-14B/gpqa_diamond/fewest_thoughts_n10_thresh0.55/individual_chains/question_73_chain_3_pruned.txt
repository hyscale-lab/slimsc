Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity... I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities add differently when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Here, u is the speed of one astronaut as per the other's frame. So let me see, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of astronaut 2, astronaut 1 is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait. Actually, I think I mixed up who's whose. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the speed of the object in the first frame, and v is the speed of the first frame relative to the second. So if we're finding the speed of
