Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix provided. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should probably write down S and then compute Ay.

Wait, Ay = c * S. So, substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write S first:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]

So, each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). So the top right element becomes (h/(4π)) * (-i) = -i h/(4π), and the bottom left becomes i h/(4π).

Now, the question asks which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue
