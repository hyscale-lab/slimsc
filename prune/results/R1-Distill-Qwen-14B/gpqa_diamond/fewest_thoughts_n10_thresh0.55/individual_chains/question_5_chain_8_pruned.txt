Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that in quantum mechanics, these components correspond to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, and sigma_z.

Wait, the question is about the operator P in an arbitrary direction n. Oh, right! When dealing with spin operators along an arbitrary axis, you usually express the operator as a combination of the standard basis (x, y, z) components. So the operator P along direction n would be something like P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z), where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, n lies in the x-z plane. So that means the direction has components only in x and z. So n_y must be zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, in the x-z plane, the angle φ might be fixed? Or maybe not, because it's arbitrary, so perhaps n is (n_x, 0, n_z
