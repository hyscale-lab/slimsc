Hmm, okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I need to figure out what the blue dithiocyanato complex is. I remember that cobalt complexes can have different colors based on their structure. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes might form different colors depending on the number of SCN- ligands attached. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^– complex, which is known for that color. So, the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, making it the dithiocyanato complex, I believe.

Stability constants, β, are given for the different complexes. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. Wait, but how do these stability constants relate to the complexes? I think each βn represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- (or something like that), and β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? Or wait, maybe the subscripts on Co are different. Let me think: Co^2+ with SCN- as ligands. So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+, because each SCN- is -1, so one SCN would make Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1). Then, the next would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0: two SCN- would be -2, so Co^2+ plus two SCN- gives neutral. Hmm, but let me make sure. Alternatively, Co^2+ plus
