Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've heard about harmonic oscillators before; they're like systems that oscillate around an equilibrium point, right? But this one is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider special relativity effects here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. Oh, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the restoring force is linear with displacement, like a spring.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. For a spring, the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA². Then the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so that probably isn't the correct answer here.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the oscillator's total energy should be the same as the maximum potential energy, right? Because when the mass is at maximum displacement A, all energy is potential, and when it's at equilibrium (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy formula change? Or is it still the same as in the non-relativistic case? Hmm, maybe it's the same because the potential is just from the spring, which is a conservative force, and the potential energy formula might not depend on velocity. So I think V = (1/2)kx² is still valid.

So the total energy E of the oscillator is (1/2)kA². At maximum speed (x=0), the energy is all kinetic. So E = K = (gamma - 1)mc² = (gamma)mc² - mc²
