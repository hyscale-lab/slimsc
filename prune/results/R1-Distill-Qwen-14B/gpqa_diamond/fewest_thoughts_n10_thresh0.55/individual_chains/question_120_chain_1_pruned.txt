Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I'm trying to remember what that means. Uniformly distributed probably implies that there's the same number of stars in any given volume of space, right? So the density is uniform.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax value.

I need to find how N (number of stars) per unit plx interval depends on plx. So if I have a range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in each bin change as plx increases or decreases.

Let me think about this. Parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by p = 1/d, assuming p is in parsecs and d is also in parsecs. So d = 1/p.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element is n multiplied by the volume. But wait, in 3D space, volume depends on distance. Oh, right, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars between r and r+dr is n * 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since p = 1/d, and d is the distance, I can express r in terms
