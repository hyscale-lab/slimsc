Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Hmm, so I need to figure out the reactants and products for each part here.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so when the base abstracts a proton, it forms a conjugate base, the enolate. Then, this enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

Wait, the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would be a new compound where the malonate's enolate adds to the acrylate.

Let me visualize this. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the substituent on the CH2 is p-tolyl. So the structure is more like CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. No, wait, actually, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl substituent on the double bond? Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R, so 3-(p-t
