Okay, so I need to figure out where the given density matrix ρ is located in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. 

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, let me write that out in terms of matrices to visualize it better. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in the (2,2) position. So when I add those two, I get a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries as 1/2.

I think the qubit space is represented in the Bloch sphere, right? Or wait, maybe it's the Bloch vector? Because for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Oh, right, the density matrix corresponds to a point in the Bloch sphere based on its expectation values.

The density matrix for a general single-qubit state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, if I can write ρ in that form, I can find the components of r.

So let's expand ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them, I get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Oh no, wait, no—because each term is multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is (1/2)([[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]]) = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is (1/2)I, where I is the
