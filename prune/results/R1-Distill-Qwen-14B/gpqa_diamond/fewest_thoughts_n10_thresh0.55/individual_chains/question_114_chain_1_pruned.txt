Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with cyanide, I think they typically undergo a nucleophilic addition. So, in this case, NaCN would act as a nucleophile. But wait, I remember that the addition of HCN to ketones usually requires a catalyst. Oh right, like an acid catalyst. So maybe H3O+ is involved here. Because when HCN is added to a ketone in acidic conditions, it protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So the product would be the addition of cyanide to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. That makes sense because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would have the CN group attached where the carbonyl was, and a hydroxyl group adjacent. So that's the first reaction done with reagent A, which is probably H3O+.

Then the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form
