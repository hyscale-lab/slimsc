Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let's see what I remember about this.

The question says the molecule is modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, so this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model would be the state where both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum. So, vibrational state n=0 and rotational state J=0. But wait, no, the rotation-vibration model combines both, so the fundamental state might be the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. Or maybe the term 'fundamental state' here refers to the lowest energy state of the molecule overall, which would be the ground state of both vibrations and rotations.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would probably be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But which one requires less energy? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy increase.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. So I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then relate that to the photon's energy, and then get the momentum from that.

Wait, photons carry energy E = hν, where ν is the frequency. Momentum p is related to energy by E = pc, but wait, that's for massless particles. Or, E = (p^2)(2m), but no, that's for kinetic energy. Hmm, for a photon, the energy is E = hν = pc, so p = E/(c). So if I find the energy difference ΔE, then the photon's momentum is ΔE divided by the speed of light.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. When it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So which transition is that? It could either be a vibrational transition or a rotational transition.

I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the energy between each vibrational level is higher than the rotational. Because for a typical diatomic molecule, the spacing between rotational levels is smaller than that of vibrational. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition is
