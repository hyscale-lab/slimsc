Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between atoms, which I think corresponds to the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 Å. But wait, in rhombohedral systems, the lattice parameters can be a bit more complex because of the angles. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges a, b, c are equal, but the angles can vary. So a = b = c = 10 Å here.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d) is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)

Wait, is that right? Or is there a different formula when the angles aren't all 90 degrees? Because in cubic systems, the formula simplifies because cos α, cos β, cos γ are all zero (
