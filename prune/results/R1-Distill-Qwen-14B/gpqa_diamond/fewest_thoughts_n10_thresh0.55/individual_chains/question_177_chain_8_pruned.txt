Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Both stars have their radius and mass in a 1.5 times ratio—Star_1 is bigger and more massive than Star_2. Interesting. The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's probably referring to their peak emission wavelengths, which relates to their temperatures.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is about how fast they're moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Oh wait, no, the luminosity is intrinsic, so radial velocity probably affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift. But wait, no, the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the observed flux. Hmm, maybe the problem is about how their actual luminosities compare, so the radial velocities might not directly affect that. Or maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

The question states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, which suggests a square or some exponential factor involved.

So, first, I think I should recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so that's correct. The peak wavelength where each star appears brightest would be determined by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is same, so T1 = T2. Is that right? Because λ1_max = λ2_max → T1 = T2. Oh, that's an important point.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply they have the same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then why are they comparing luminosities? Because if they're same temperature, then the luminosity would depend on radius squared. But the problem says Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Then, since L = 4π R² σ T⁴, and T is same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options have other choices close to that. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh wait, no, luminosity is an intrinsic property. Radial velocity affects the observed flux due to Dop
