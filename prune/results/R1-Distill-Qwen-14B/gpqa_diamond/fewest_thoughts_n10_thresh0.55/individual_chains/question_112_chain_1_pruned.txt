Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I'm supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a different operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij equal to ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's parse the question. The state |alpha> is given in terms of the z-basis states |up> and |down>. The operator in question has a matrix form where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. Wait, so the matrix would be 2x2 since we're dealing with spin-½ particles. Let me write it out.

The operator A would have:
A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Because i≠j for the off-diagonal elements, and 0 otherwise. Wait, no, wait. The problem says A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, that's exactly what I wrote. So that's our operator.

Wait, but for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Let me think, what operator has this form? Oh, right, the σx operator multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) σx. So, the operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σx. The eigenstates of σx are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in the |+x> and |-x> states. Then, calculate the average value of operator A.

Okay, let's proceed step by step.

First, normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up
