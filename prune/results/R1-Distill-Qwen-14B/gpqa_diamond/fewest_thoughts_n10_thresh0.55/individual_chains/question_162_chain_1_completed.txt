Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32) / (4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx and dy terms, no dz or other coordinates. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime, maybe? Or perhaps it's embedded in higher dimensions, but the metric itself is for two coordinates.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid, which is the classic pseudosphere. But wait, what's the relation between the metric and the area?

I remember that in differential geometry, the area element is related to the metric tensor. The area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface, but wait, in 2D, the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

Wait, no, actually, for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is (g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})²), and the area element is sqrt(det) dx dy. But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so g_{xy} is zero. So the determinant is just g_{xx} * g_{yy}. But wait, in this metric, the coefficients are functions of x and y.

Wait, let me write this out. The metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

So, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32 / (4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant of the metric tensor g is (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y². So the determinant is (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2.

The area element dA would then be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. In 2D, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where det(g) is the determinant of the metric tensor. But in this case, since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y². So sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, but wait, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, so dA = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Wait, but the area of the entire pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over the entire surface. But wait, looking at the denominator, 4 - (x² + y²) must be positive for the metric to make sense, right? Because otherwise, the coefficient could be negative, leading to a different signature. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the region of integration is x² + y² <4. So the area is the integral over all x and y such that x² + y² <4, of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but this is a 2D metric, so this is a 2-dimensional surface. The pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, but perhaps this metric represents the induced metric on the pseudosphere.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric in 2D, representing a space with some curvature. But the question refers to the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, the radius given is r=2. So perhaps the pseudosphere has radius 2, and I'm to find its area. But the options don't involve r, except options B and C, which have x² and y², but those might be incorrect because the area should be a constant, not dependent on x and y. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is known to be 4π times the square of its radius. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, for a sphere, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere, if I remember correctly, is actually infinite, because it's a surface that extends infinitely in some way. Wait, but that can't be right because it's a finite surface. Wait, no, the tractricoid, which is the classic pseudosphere, is a finite area? Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, the tractricoid is a surface of revolution generated by rotating a tractrix, and it's a finite surface. The area is actually finite. Let me think. The tractrix has a certain property, but when you rotate it, the area is finite. I think the area of a pseudosphere is 4π r, but I'm not sure. Or maybe 4π r²? Or something else.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused between the sphere and the pseudosphere. For a sphere of radius r, the area is 4π r². For a pseudosphere, the area is 4π r. Or perhaps it's another expression.

Wait, but the options given include 4π(x² + y²), which would vary, but the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere, which should be a specific number, not a function of x and y. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the options given are A)0, B)4pi(x² + y²), C)4pi(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are perhaps not presented correctly. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the area of a certain region in the given metric.

Wait, perhaps the metric represents a 2D space, and I'm to compute the area covered by the metric. So the denominator is (4 -x² -y²), which is positive when x² + y² <4. So the region of integration is a disk of radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the metric is defined for x² + y² <4, and the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, I would integrate [32/(4 - r²)] over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π, using polar coordinates.

Wait, in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because [32/(4 - r²)] is the sqrt(det(g)), multiplied by the r from the polar area element.

So, the integral becomes:

Area = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Compute that:

First, integrate over r:

Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Which becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-1/2) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4→0) (1/u) du → 32 * (-1/2) [ln u from 4 to 0] → 32 * (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln 0 - ln4 = -infty - ln4 → -infty.

So the integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) * (-infty) ) = 32 * (1/2) * infty = 16 * infty = infty.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, so the integrand becomes large, leading the integral to diverge. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that's in the given metric. So the area of the pseudosphere (tractricoid) under this metric would be infinite? Or am I mixing up things here.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a finite surface. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is defined on a certain space which has infinite area.

Wait, but the region x² + y² <4 is finite. The integral, however, might be divergent because the integrand approaches infinity as r approaches 2.

Let me compute the integral more carefully:

Compute ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² ⇒ du = -2r dr ⇒ (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [1/u] (-1/2) du.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du.

= 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ]

= 32 * (-1/2) [ (ln 0) - ln4 ) ]

But ln0 is -infinity. So this becomes:

32 * (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ) ] = 32 * (-1/2) ( -infty ) = 32*(1/2)*infty = 16 infty = infty.

So the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

But that's in the given metric. So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the question says 'what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?'.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the area of a pseudosphere is finite, but according to this metric, the area is infinite. So perhaps the given metric describes a space with infinite area, which is modeled after a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a sphere, but in this case, the area is infinite because the curvature is negative and the space extends infinitely.

Wait, the metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). Let me think about the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in 2D can be found using the formula involving the determinant of the Riemann tensor, but perhaps it's easier to use a formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = (-1/(2√g)) * [ ∂_y (g_{xx} ∂_x (sqrt(g))) - ∂_x (g_{yy} ∂_y (sqrt(g))) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate using a known formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), which is polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is K = -(1/(2 r)) d( ln f(r) ) / dr.

Wait, wait, but in this case, the metric is written in terms of x and y, which are Cartesian coordinates, but it's symmetric in x and y, so maybe we can switch to polar coordinates.

So, let me define r² = x² + y². Then, in polar coordinates, the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

So, f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, so f(r) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²).

The formula for K in polar coordinates is:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ d/dr ( ln f(r) ) ]

Let me compute ln f(r) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

The derivative d/dr of ln f(r) is (1/2) * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) → (r)/(4 - r²).

So, K = - (1/(2r)) [ (r/(4 - r²)) ] = - (1/(2r)) * (r/(4 - r²)) ) = - [ 1/(2(4 - r²)) ) ]

So the Gaussian curvature is K(r) = -1/(2(4 - r²)).

Wait, but the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So for it to be a pseudosphere, K should be constant. But K here depends on r, which is x² + y².

Hmm, that suggests that the metric given is not that of a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature everywhere. So perhaps this is a different kind of surface.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the formula for K. Let me double-check. Another formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates (where the metric is conformally flat, as here) is K = - (1/(2r)) d/dr (r * d(ln f)/dr ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature more carefully.

Wait, let's try another approach. For a metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ², where E = (32/(4 - r²)), and G = (32 r²)/(4 - r²).

The Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ - ( (E_r) / (2 r E) ) ]

where E_r is the derivative of E with respect to r.

So, E = 32/(4 - r²).

E_r = dE/dr = (0 - (32)(-2r))/(4 - r²)^2 ) → (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2.

So,

K = - ( (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) / ( 2 r * (32/(4 - r²)) ) )

Simplify denominator: 2r * 32/(4 - r²) )= 64 r/(4 - r²)

So,

K = - [ (64 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ] / [ 64 r/(4 - r²) ) ]

The 64 r terms cancel, and (4 - r²)^2 divided by (4 - r²) is (4 - r²).

So,

K = - [ 1/(4 - r²) ) ]

Which is the same as earlier: K(r) = -1/(4 - r²).

Hmm, so this curvature isn't constant; it depends on r. So the surface described by this metric is not a pseudosphere, which requires constant negative curvature. So perhaps the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. So maybe I'm off track.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. So perhaps despite the given metric, the answer is based on known properties of pseudospheres.

Wait, the classic pseudosphere has finite area. Let me think: The tractricoid (pseudosphere) has an area of 4πr²? No, wait, that's the sphere. For a pseudosphere, maybe the area is 4πr. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is 4π(r), but I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, let me think about the Gaussian curvature. The area of a surface with constant negative curvature K can be related to the Euler characteristic via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a compact surface without boundary, like a sphere, the integral of K over the surface is 4π. But a pseudosphere isn't compact; it's infinitely long. So the integral of K over the entire surface would be infinite, leading the area to be infinite as well.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, which is compactified by adding a point at infinity, making it a sphere with negative curvature? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 4πr², but that's the sphere. Alternatively, maybe the given metric is for a pseudosphere of radius 2, and for that, its area would be 4π r², but with r=2, 4π*(2)^2=16π?

But the options don't include 16π. The options are A) 0, B) 4pi(x²+y²), C)4pi(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is D) +infty. Because the given metric's area integral diverges, as we saw earlier.

But then why is the question about the pseudosphere of radius 2? Because the given metric's area is infinite, which would imply that the pseudosphere has infinite area, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me, because the metric's denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric's coefficients blow up, making the area infinite. So the area is infinite, which aligns with option D.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the area element in differential geometry, which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is defined, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), or equivalently \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( xy \)-plane. Converting to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The radial integral can be evaluated by substituting \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) approaches infinity as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

The options provided are:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is a constant and does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is a constant and does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as shown by the divergent integral.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

Answer: D
