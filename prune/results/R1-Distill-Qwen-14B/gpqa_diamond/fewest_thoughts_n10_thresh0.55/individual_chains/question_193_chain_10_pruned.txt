Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula I'm thinking is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. Or wait, is it d = 1/plx? Yeah, that's right. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So 1/(plx)^5 would be (d)^5. Because (1/plx) is d, so (d)^5 is (1/plx)^5, which makes N proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, then substituting plx gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which is 1/(1/(d^5)) → d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the density or the rate at which stars are present as you move further out. I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions "per unit range of distance, r." So perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, not the cumulative number up to r.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume. Because when you go to a larger distance, the volume increases, and how does that affect the number of stars? But wait, the problem is about a specific region, so maybe it's the number of stars in a given volume as a function of distance.

But the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But wait, that seems very steep. Why would the number of stars increase so rapidly with distance? That doesn't make sense because,
