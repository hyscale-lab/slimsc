Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that the conditions in the photosphere follow Boltzmann's distribution.

Wait, right, Boltzmann's equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and n_i and n_j are the number of particles in energy states i and j.

In this case, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, for each star, we can model the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another lower state). Let me denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as level j. So the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

For star 1, the ratio would be n1 = (number in excited state) / (number in lower state) = 2. For star 2, the ratio would be n2 = 1, perhaps? Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n1 = 2 and n2 = 1, but I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps star_2 has a lower ratio, so n1 = 2 * n2. Wait, let me re-read the question. "Iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if for star_2 the ratio is x, then star_1 is 2x. But wait, using the Boltzmann equation, each star's ratio is determined by their own temperature. So for each star, the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). So for star_1, n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T
