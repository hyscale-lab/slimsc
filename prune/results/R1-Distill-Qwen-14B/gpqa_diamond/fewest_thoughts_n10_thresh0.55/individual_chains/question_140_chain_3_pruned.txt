Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is about 4°C because 273 K is 0°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature. 

Then there's something about the product of a keto acid with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. Sub X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. I remember that common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, etc. Sub X has heavier isotopes; so perhaps it's a metal with a common heavier isotope.

Hmm, melting point of B is ~277 K. Let me think, what has a melting point around there. Water freezes at 273 K, so maybe it's a solid that's similar. Wait, but wait, the melting point is close to 277 K. So when you heat the precipitate G, you get B. So what could B be? Maybe sodium hydroxide? No, that's more like 318°C melting point. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Another approach: the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule must be something like D2O maybe? No, wait, the molecule is a gas. Let's think: what gases have equal protons and neutrons. Like H2O? No. Wait, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each molecule. Wait, but the molecule as a whole. Oh wait, maybe it's something like H2O, where each molecule has 8 protons (since H has 1 each and O has 8, so total 10 protons). But that wouldn't fit because the number of protons and neutrons are equal. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4. No, that's 5 protons and 6 neutrons? Wait, let me calculate.

Wait, the molecule of gas W must have the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, let's think of H2O. Each H has 1 proton, O
