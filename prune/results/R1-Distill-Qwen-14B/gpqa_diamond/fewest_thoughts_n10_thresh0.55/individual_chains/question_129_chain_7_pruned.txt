Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's see. The question involves a series of reactions starting with compound A and going through B, C, D to E. There are also some hints given, so I'll need to use those.

First, let me break down the reaction steps. 

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, so A might have a ketone or aldehyde. The product B would then be a cyanohydrin if A is a ketone. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be a cyanohydrin as well, but maybe a secondary alcohol.

2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, which typically reduces triple bonds or double bonds. If B has a triple bond, like from HCN addition, the reduction would add hydrogen. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a nitrile group? Or wait, no. HCN adds to a ketone to form an cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile adjacent. So when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2, but wait, no, in presence of H2 and Pd, maybe it's hydrogenated to CH2NH2? Or perhaps more likely, the nitrile (CN) gets reduced to CH2NH2, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another thought: hydrogenation of nitriles (RCN) under H2 and a catalyst like Pd gives amines (RCH2NH2?), but wait, no, that's more like using H2 and a metal like LiAlH4. Alternatively, maybe under H2 and a catalyst, the nitrile is hydrogenated to a primary amine. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. Reduction of nitriles with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni gives a primary amine. So RCN + H2 → RCH2NH2. But I'm not certain about the conditions here. Wait, the question says H2 in presence of Pd, so maybe that's a different catalyst. Alternatively, I might need to consider other possibilities. Oh, wait, if B is a cyanohydrin (from a ketone), then it has an -OH and a CN group adjacent. So when you reduce that, the CN group would become CH2NH2. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is more about any double bonds, but perhaps in this case, the nitrile is the functional group that's being reduced.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in order.

Step 1: A → B with HCN. So A is a ketone. Let's assume it's a cyclic ketone because the options are all cyclic ketones.

So if A is a cycloketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. For example, cyclohexanone would react with HCN to form a cyanocyclohexanol, but more accurately, the product would have the structure where the ketone O is replaced by
