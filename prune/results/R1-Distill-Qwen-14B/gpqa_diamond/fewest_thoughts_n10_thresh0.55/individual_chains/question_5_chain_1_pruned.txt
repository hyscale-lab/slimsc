Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Wait, the operator P—oh, right, in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. So the eigenvector here will correspond to the state where the momentum (since P is related to momentum) has a component of ħ/2 along the direction n.

The problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write them out:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0 , 1],
              [1, 0]]

Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
              [i, 0]]

Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],
              [0, -1]]

So the operator P along the direction n would be the vector sum of these components. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it's a direction that can be described using polar coordinates where the angle is in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), maybe? Wait, no, the x-z plane implies that the angle is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So, the spherical coordinates would have φ=0 since it's in the x-z plane. So, θ would be the polar angle from the x-axis to n.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction. Oh, right, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) in spherical coordinates. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because when φ=0, cosφ=1, sinφ=0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, when φ=0, the position is along the x-axis, and as θ increases, we move towards the z-axis
