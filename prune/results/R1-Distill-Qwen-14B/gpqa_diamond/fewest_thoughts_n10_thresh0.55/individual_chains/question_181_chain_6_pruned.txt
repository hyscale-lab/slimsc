Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux question. Hmm, the setup is a bit tricky. Let me think. So the question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago, and we're looking at the ratio of neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Wait, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various processes in the sun. The pp chain is one of the main sources, and it produces a lot of neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. But there are also other processes, like the CNO cycle, which contributes to some neutrinos too. Oh, and the pp-III branchâ€”I should remember what that entails. 

The pp chain goes through several steps. The main branches are I, II, and III. I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of the high-energy neutrinos. Oh right, because in the pp-III branch, when boron-11 captures a proton, it emits a helium-3 and a neutrino. These high-energy neutrinos are called the 700 keV neutrinos, right?

Wait, no, wait. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 700 keV, and the CNO cycle produces neutrinos around 400 keV, I think. Oh wait, no, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So, the dominant neutr
