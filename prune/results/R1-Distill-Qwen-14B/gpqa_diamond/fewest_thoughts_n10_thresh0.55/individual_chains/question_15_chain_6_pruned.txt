Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Both have the same minimum masses, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular, so eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radii? Interesting. So if two stars have the same radius but different masses, that probably means one is more evolved or perhaps a subgiant or something, but I don't think that affects the transit probability directly.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = R_p / (2R*) * (a / (R*)), where R_p is the planet's radius, R* the star's radius, and a the semi-major axis. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s)) or something like that? Wait, no, I think the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think more carefully. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size, and the relative sizes of the planet and star. The formula I recall is P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s) / something... Or wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, but that seems off. Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)).

Wait, perhaps another way. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^
