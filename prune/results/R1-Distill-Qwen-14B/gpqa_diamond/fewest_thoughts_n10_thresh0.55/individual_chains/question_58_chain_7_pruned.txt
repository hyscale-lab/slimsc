Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems because they don't give meaningful physical predictions. Regularization helps make these terms finite so you can renormalize them.

Wait, so the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when dealing with high energies. Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. I think classical theories don't usually have these kinds of divergences because they're not quantized. Or wait, do they have issues? I remember that in classical electromagnetism, you can have problems like the infinite self-energy of a charged particle. But that's handled in the context of point charges. Oh wait, but regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So in classical theories, maybe these divergences aren't a problem the same way. Because in classical E&M, you use Maxwell's equations, and maybe the divergences are handled differently or are considered as mathematical artifacts rather than requiring regularization.

So if the question is about a theory that never requires regularization, maybe it's the classical theory because it doesn't involve the same loop diagrams and renormalization processes as quantum theories. Quantum theories like QED (option C) do require renormalization because of loop divergences. Same with Quantum Chromodynamics (option B), which is the theory of the strong force and involves things like the running of coupling constants and dealing with things like Landau poles. Oh, but wait, QCD does have asymptotic freedom, which makes it manageable at high energies, but I think it still requires regularization techniques like lattice QCD or using a regulator in calculations.

Superstring theory (option A) is a quantum theory as well, but it's supposed to be a theory of everything, incorporating gravity and all. String theories have different behaviors at different energy scales. But I'm not sure if they require regularization. Wait, I think string theories avoid some of the divergences that occur in point particle theories because strings have a different structure. They also use concepts like T-duality and have a more controlled behavior
