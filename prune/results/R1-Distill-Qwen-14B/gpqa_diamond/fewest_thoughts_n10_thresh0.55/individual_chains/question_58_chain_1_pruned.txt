Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math messy or impossible. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite so you can calculate them, and then you take the cutoff away in the end. But some theories might not need this because they don't have these divergences in the first place.

So the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization. Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't usually have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical E&M, do you get divergences? Like, in Maxwell's equations, the fields are smooth, but when you look at point charges, you have issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. Oh, but wait, classical E&M doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe for it, you don't need regularization. Because regularization is a quantum field theory approach.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. But does it require regularization? Well, you do need regularization to handle loop integrals and renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergences. So you have to regularize, then renormalize. So QED does require regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative methods work. But wait, even so, for handling the theory, you probably need regularization. Because loop integrals in QCD also lead to divergences. So you regularize and then renormalize. So B requires regularization. So not the answer.
