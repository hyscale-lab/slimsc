Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait, lithium has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make a mass number of 6. So X is Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. So I remember that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic formulas. The key formula here is the total energy of a particle, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that. 

Let me plug in the values. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So the denominator inside the square root is
