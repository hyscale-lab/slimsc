Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

First, I need to find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do that more precisely. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857...

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me do it step by step. 1 / 0.28 equals? Let's see, 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/(28/100)=100/28. 28 times 3 is 84; 100-84 is 16. So 3 and 16/28, which simplifies to 3 and 4/7. 4/7 is about 0.5714. So 3.5714, which is about 3.5714.

Now, the next
