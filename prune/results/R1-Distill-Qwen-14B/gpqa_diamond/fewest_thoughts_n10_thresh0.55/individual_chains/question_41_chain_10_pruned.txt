Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. So in this case, the speed of light in the glass should be 1/n. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Does that affect the observed speed of the light beam?

Oh right, this probably involves some relativity. Because when the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the observer, you can't just add the velocities linearly. Wait, but glass is a material, not a vacuum. I'm a bit rusty on how velocities add in such cases.

Wait, so in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v' = 1/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, how does the light's velocity change?

I think this might be a case where we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab frame isn't just (v' + v). Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but wait, wait.

Wait, no. That's only in a vacuum. Because light in a medium has a different speed, depending on the medium's properties. So maybe relativity doesn't apply directly here because the medium is moving, but light's speed in the medium is still governed by the refractive index.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass as observed from the lab. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Inside the glass, the light is moving at v' = 1/n. But how do these combine?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of reference frames. Let's consider the glass's rest frame first. In that frame, the light is moving at v' = 1/n. Now, the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at
