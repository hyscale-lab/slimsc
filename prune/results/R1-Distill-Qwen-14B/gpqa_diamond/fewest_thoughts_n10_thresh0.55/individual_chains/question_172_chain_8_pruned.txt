Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, the distribution of energy levels in atoms depends on temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution plays a role here.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. But maybe the exact value isn't needed for this equation part.

I think the key is the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). But wait, in this case, the higher energy level is more populated in star_1. So for star_1, n1_iron is twice that of star_2's, meaning n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for a given energy level, N1 = 2*N2. So the ratio N1/N2 = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann factor, N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. Assuming E2 is the higher energy level, so ΔE is positive. So if N1 is higher than N2, then the ratio N1/N2 is greater than 1, meaning that exp( -ΔE/(kT)) is less than 1. So exp( -ΔE/(kT1) ) = N2/N1 = 1/2. So ln( N1/N2 ) = ln(2) = (ΔE)/(k T1) * (-1) * (-1) because the equation would be N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

Wait, let me get this right. The ratio is N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k T)). Because the general formula is N_i/N_j = exp( (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since E_i is higher in this case (because it's the excited state), E_i - E_j is positive. So N_i/N_j = exp
