Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral structures are a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, it's often calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the formula I remember is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos alpha - 2mn cos beta - 2nl cos gamma), but wait, that might be specific to rhombohedral systems. Or maybe it's a more general case. Alternatively, for cubic systems, it's simpler, but this isn't cubic.

So the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance might be the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in this case because for a simple structure, like perhaps a primitive rhombohedral lattice, the distance between atoms is 'a'. So I can assume a = 10 Angstrom.

The Miller indices are (111). So l, m, n are all 1.

Putting the values into the formula: d = a / sqrt(1² +1² +1² - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 -
