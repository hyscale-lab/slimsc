Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm a bit rusty on the relationship between parallax and distance, so I need to remember that. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) = 1/(distance in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

Wait, the formula given is N proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I can write N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think it's about the number of stars per unit volume or something like that. Or perhaps the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about how the number of stars observed in a region depends on distance. Parallax is a measure of distance—lower parallax means further away. So if we're observing a certain region, the number of stars we see at a particular distance (or in a thin shell at distance r) would depend on how many stars are actually present there and how they are distributed.

The problem says N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, N is proportional to d^5. So for a given distance d, the number of stars at that distance is proportional to d^5. But wait, when we talk about the number of stars per unit distance, we might be considering how the density changes with r. Because if you have a thin shell at r with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^2 times the number density (since the surface area of a sphere is 4πr²). But in this case, the problem might be simplified because it's in a specific region, so perhaps it's considering a different approach.

Wait, let's clarify. The observed number of stars varies as 1/(plx
