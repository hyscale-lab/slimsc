Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The possible products are given in the multiple-choice options. I need to figure out what the starting compound X is, then determine what it becomes after the reaction.

The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at those first.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but more likely O-H here. The other peaks are at 1720 cm-1 (suggesting a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester), and 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be aromatic C=C stretching vibrations. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and possibly an alcohol group or something else with an O-H.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton would be around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, a broad peak could be an -OH in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde or an amide proton, but I don't see other peaks that might indicate amides.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The integration is 1H as a singlet. For an aldehyde, it's a singlet because it's adjacent to no other protons. But an aldehyde's H is usually around 9-10 ppm, maybe a bit higher. So 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid, which would be around 10-12 as a broad peak. So maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then the next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, also a double
