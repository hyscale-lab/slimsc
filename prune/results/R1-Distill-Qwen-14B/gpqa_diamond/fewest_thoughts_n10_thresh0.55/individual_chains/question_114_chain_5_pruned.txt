Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I think I should break this down step by step. Let me think about each reaction individually.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, a nucleophile. So, the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

In a typical nucleophilic addition to a ketone, the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, after the attack, the oxygen becomes O- and then gets protonated. So, in the product, the oxygen is an alcohol. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no—the structure after addition would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and methyl groups. So, that suggests that the nitrile is added to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: when a ketone like (CH3)2CO reacts with CN-, the mechanism would be the CN- attacking the carbonyl carbon to form an alkoxide intermediate. Then, that would get protonated to give an alcohol and a cyanide. But in this case, the product is a nitrile, not an alcohol. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Oh! No, wait—if the conditions are such that after the addition, the product
