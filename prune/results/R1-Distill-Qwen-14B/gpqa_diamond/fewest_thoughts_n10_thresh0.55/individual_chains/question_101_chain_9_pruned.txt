Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The reaction given is an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what compound A is and which catalyst (B) is used.

Hmm, acid-catalyzed reactions... I remember that in such reactions, especially those involving amines, things like aldehyde or ketone groups might be involved. Wait, pyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring.

The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Let me draw the structures to visualize better. So the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. That means there's a substituent on the pyrrolidine's nitrogen (position 1) which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring, right? Because "idene" denotes a double bond, like in cyclohexene.

So, the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene (-CH2-) group. So, the structure would
