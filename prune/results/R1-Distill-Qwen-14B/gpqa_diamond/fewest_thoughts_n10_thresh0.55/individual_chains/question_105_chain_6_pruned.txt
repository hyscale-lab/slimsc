Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, we observe periodic brightness changes, similar to what we might see if an exoplanet were transiting the star.

The main question is: what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots? And the options are A to D.

So, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. So I need to calculate the equivalent depth caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same depth.

Hmm, let me think about the star spots. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness changes. The brightness variation depends on how much area is covered by spots and their temperature difference.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the area of a hemisphere is (4πR^2)/2 = 2πR². So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR². Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that's covered, so for each hemisphere, it's 0.2 of that hemisphere's area. But since we're looking at only one hemisphere being spotted, maybe the calculation is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the total area of the spots on the entire star is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). So the surface area of the star is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's rotation would bring those spots into view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when we look from Earth, we'd only see the spots when they're on the side facing us as the star rotates. So the observed area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R². But when the star rotates, the spots come and go from view, so the maximum area we see at any time is 0.4π R². No, wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.

The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So when the star is viewed face-on, the entire hemisphere is visible. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (area of a hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

So the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered, so perhaps the spots are only on that hemisphere, and the other
