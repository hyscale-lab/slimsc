Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. The question gives me the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for the complexes. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, first I should remember what stability constants are. Stability constants (β) indicate the tendency of a complex to form. A higher β means a more stable complex. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. 

In this case, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2−n, where n is from 1 to 4, I suppose. The β values are given for each n. So β1 is for the monodentate complex, β2 for the di, and so on.

The problem states the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. We're looking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex. Because the question says "blue dithiocyanato," which I recall is the Co(SCN)_2^+ or maybe neutral. Hmm, not entirely sure about the charge, but the exact charge might not matter for this calculation.

So the approach is to calculate the concentrations of each complex and then find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex.

I remember that the formation of complexes can be modeled using the stability constants. The general formula is:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}]/([Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n)

But wait, each β is for adding another SCN- ion. So the first complex is Co(SCN), then Co(SCN)_2, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of stepwise formation constants. No, the given β values are the overall stability constants for each complex. So for n=1, β1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)

And so on up to n=4.

The total concentration of all cobalt species is the sum of [Co^2+], [Co
