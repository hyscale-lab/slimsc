Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a mass m in a 1D harmonic oscillator. It's relativistic, which probably means we can't just use the classical equations here. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. But wait, that's the classical case. Here, it's relativistic, so special relativity must come into play.

In special relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes the rest mass energy. The oscillator's energy would be the sum of its rest mass energy and the oscillatory energy. But I'm not entirely sure about the setup here. Let me think about the energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

The potential energy in a classical harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But relativistically, maybe that's modified. Oh, but wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So that suggests the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the equations of motion might be relativistic.

Wait, but in special relativity, the momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma times m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So when the mass is moving, its momentum p = gamma m v. The total energy E would then be gamma m c², right? Because in relativity, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

But wait, the oscillator is exchanging potential and kinetic energy. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max², leading to the classical v_max as sqrt(kA²/m). But with relativity, the situation might be different because energy includes the rest mass.

So perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic? Or when the potential energy is a certain fraction of the total energy.

Wait, no. The oscillator's total energy should include both the rest mass and the oscillation energy. Hmm. Let's think about the energy.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is
