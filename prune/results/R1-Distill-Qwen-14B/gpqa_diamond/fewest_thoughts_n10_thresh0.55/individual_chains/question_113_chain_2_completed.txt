Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to use the given data to determine which formula fits.

The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry results. Let's go through each piece.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—if it's a broad peak, it's more likely an O-H group, as in an alcohol or phenol. But another possibility is an amine, but that's less likely here.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution or a C=O in an ester or something else. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group, such as in a ketone with double bonds nearby. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, maybe an alkene or a conjugated system. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests the molecule has a double bond somewhere.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. M/z 45 is a common fragment, maybe indicating a CH3CO group or something like that. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, the methyl group (CH3) has a mass of 15, but I don't think that's it. Wait, 45 is C3H7O if it's CH3COO- (but wait, that's maybe 60—no, wait. Let me calculate. Methanol is 32, ethanol 46. Wait, maybe 45 is a different fragment. Another possibility is that it's a carbonyl-containing fragment, like CH2=CH-O- something. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, let's think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, each has a different number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. Let's think about the IR first. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group. So that would point towards either an alcohol or a phenol. But if it's a phenol, the O-H stretch is usually broader and perhaps stronger. Also, phenols have aromatic signals in NMR, but the question says that the NMR includes vinyl hydrogens, which could be from a double bond in the ring or elsewhere.

Wait, the presence of a carbonyl in IR. If there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is another functional group, but more likely, the 1700 is a carbonyl and 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if the molecule is an aromatic ester, perhaps. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is the C=C in an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or something with a double bond next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X and N are zero here.

For option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So that's one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So maybe an aromatic ring isn't present, but an alkene. Alternatively, the compound could have an ester group (O) and a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Given the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. Either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating at least one double bond (so a degree of unsaturation of 1 from a double bond). So looking at the options, all have at least one double bond or ring except maybe if they have more.

Wait, wait, degree of unsaturation counts each ring or double bond as 1.

So, for each compound:

A: Degree 1. So either one ring or one double bond or a combination that sums to 1.
B: Degree 2. Two rings, one ring and one double bond, two double bonds.
C: Degree 2.
D: Degree 1.

But the question says that the NMR includes peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond. So all options except maybe some may have a double bond. Let's see.

But wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 which I think is a carbonyl. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group.

So maybe, the compound is an ester or ketone or something with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, esters have the carbonyl group (around 1700 cm^-1), and maybe an adjacent oxygen. So an ester would fit with O2 in the formula.

Looking back, the possible formulas with O2 are A and C.

Option C is C6H10O2. So molecular formula would be something like an ester with a double bond.

So, esters have the structure R-O-C-O-R. Wait, no, it's R-O-C-O-R? No, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the ester functional group is O and a carbonyl.

Wait, an ester has the formula RCOOR', so each ester group contributes two oxygen atoms. So for an ester, the formula would have O2. So that would fit with options A and C.

But let's think about the molecular formulas.

If the compound is an ester, perhaps with a double bond as well, which is why the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens.

Wait, the mass spectrum has a fragment at 45. Let me think about possible esters and their possible fragments.

So, if the compound is an ester, the structure would be something like RCOOR'. Let's say it's a methyl ester. The fragment at m/z 45 could be a fragment from the ester group. For example, the ester group (like CH3O-CO-) might fragment into smaller ions.

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment m/z 45 is the mass of (CH2)2O? Let me calculate. CH2CH2O has a mass of (12*2)+(1*4)+(16)= 24+4+16=44. No, that's 44. So 45 could be something else. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 45? Let's calculate: CH3-O-CH3 would be (12*2)+(1*6)+16= 24+6+16=46. No, that's 46. Wait, so that's not it.

Another approach: the molecular formula of the compound could help. Let's think for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) = 72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW:72+10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum's m/z 45 is a fragment. Let's think of the possible structures.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), perhaps the structure is something like methyl propenoate or another ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, so no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43, close but not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from an ester. For example, if the ester group is CH2COO-, the fragment could be (CH2COO-) losing something. Alternatively, the ester might break into a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, think about the ester cleavage. When an ester breaks, it can form a ketene ion. For example, an ester RCOOR' upon fragmentation might lose the R' group and form a ketene (RCO), whose mass would be (RCO)'s mass.

Wait, let's calculate. If the fragment is m/z 45, which is 45 g/mol. Let's see what RCO would weigh 45. RCO would be (R is an alkyl group).

RCO: (12 + 16) + alkyl.

So 28 (12+16) plus R's mass equals 45. So R's mass is 17? That's not possible because the smallest alkyl is CH3 (15), which would give RCO as 28+15=43. Close to 45 but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is something else. Maybe the ester group breaks into a smaller part. For example, CH2COO- would have a mass of 58 (12*2 + 1*4 + 16*2=24+4+32=60? Wait, no: CH2COO is CH2-COO. The formula is C2H3O2. Wait, molecular weight is (2*12)+(3*1)+(2*16)=24+3+32=59. So that's 59, which doesn't match 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different fragment. Let's think about the molecular formula of each option.

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. The molecular formula could be like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 or something. Let's imagine the structure.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a vinyl group (like CH2=CHCOOR), then the vinyl protons would appear as a triplet or multiplet in the NMR.

But perhaps the mass fragment comes from the ester group itself. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong absorption at 1700, which is likely a carbonyl. The 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic protons. So perhaps 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure might have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl.

So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would have a conjugated double bond (so C=C next to the carbonyl), hence the IR peak around 1650.

In that case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (because CH2=CHCOO would have 3 carbons and 3 oxygens? Wait, no—CH2=CHCOO- is three carbons, but the ester would have another three from the OR group, making it six carbons. Wait:

Let's count:

CH2=CHCOO-O-R? No, wait, the ester is RCOOR'. So, for example, if R is CH2CH2 and R' is CH2CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl benzoate or something else. But maybe that's getting too specific.

Back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a larger group. For example, the ester group could break off, leaving a smaller fragment.

Wait, let me think of the possible ester structures and their fragments. For instance, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The molecular formula is C4H6O2.

If upon fragmentation, methyl acrylate could lose the methyl group (CH3), leaving the acrylate ion (CH2=CHCOO-), which would have a mass of (72 + 16*2) = 72+32=104. But I'm not sure how that would fragment to 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the R-O- part. For methyl groups, the loss of OMe (31) from the ester could leave the COO group, which is 44 (12 + 16*2). But that's 44, close to 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acetate ion, (CH3COO-), which has a mass of 60 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 =24 +3 +32=59). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the compound is a ketone with an ester group, but that might complicate things.

Another approach: the molecular formula for each option. Let's see which ones have a possible ester group.

Option A: C6H12O2. Suppose the structure is an ester with a six-carbon chain. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have a formula of C6H12O2, right? Wait, let me compute:

Ester RCOOR' where R is CH2CH2COO and R' is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no—RCOOR' would have (n + m + 2) carbons, where R is n and R' is m.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that's less likely.

Wait, going back. If the compound has a structure with a carbonyl, an ester group, a double bond (vinyl), and an O-H group (broad peak in IR), perhaps it's a diol ester or something else.

Wait, but the FTIR's broad peak at 3000 could also correspond to an alcohol (O-H stretching). So the compound has an -OH group.

So, putting this together, the compound has an ester group (from the 1700 cm^-1), a carbonyl (ester), an O-H group (alcohol), and a double bond (vinyl protons in NMR). So perhaps the formula is something like a hydroxyl ester, like a glycolic ester or similar.

Wait, but glycolic acid is HOCH2COOH. Its ester would be HOCH2COOR. That structure has an O-H (alcohol) and an ester group (O-CO-O). So the IR would show the broad O-H around 3000, the ester carbonyl around 1700, and any double bonds would show up in the NMR. But if the structure has a double bond, perhaps it's an allyl ester or something with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the FTIR also has a peak at 1650. So if the molecule has a conjugated double bond (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), the carbonyl's IR would shift to a lower wavenumber due to conjugation. So the 1700 would be the carbonyl, and 1650 would be the conjugated double bond.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such a structure would have the conjugated system, leading to the lower wavenumber for the double bond.

In such a structure, the O-H would be present (but wait, in the structure I thought of earlier, there's no O-H. So maybe there's an additional OH group. So perhaps the formula includes both an ester and an alcohol.

Wait, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the molecular formulas again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → could be an ester with a ring or a double bond.

B) C6H10O → has less H, so perhaps more rings or double bonds.

C) C6H10O2 → has two oxygen and more double bonds.

D) C6H12O → one oxygen, maybe an alcohol with a ring.

But the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which would be O-H, so D is an option (D is C6H12O, which would have an OH group). But D's degree of unsaturation is 1, so maybe a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So D would have one double bond and an OH group.

But in that case, the IR would have the broad O-H, and another peak at 1700 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So if D is the compound, then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, option D is C6H12O. So molecular formula is C6H12O. Possible structures could be an alcohol (O-H) and a ketone (carbonyl). But wait, a ketone would require another oxygen, which D doesn't have. So that can't be, because D only has one O. So the carbonyl (like a ketone) would require O, but D has only one O. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ether with a ketone. But again, that would require more oxygen. No, that can't be.

So, perhaps D is not the correct option because it can't have both the O-H and a carbonyl group (since it only has one O atom). So the presence of a carbonyl in the IR would require at least two O atoms, which are present in options A, C, and possibly B?

Wait, option B is C6H10O. So it has one O. So can it have a carbonyl group? If so, it would have a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde), but the O-H would need another O. So no, because B only has one O. So the compound must have at least two O's to have both an O-H and a carbonyl group. So the options with O2 are A, C.

So the correct options are A and C. So now the question is between A and C.

Now, the degree of unsaturation for option C is 2: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Similarly, option A: (2*6 +2 -12)/2=14-12=2 → 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So either option could have that.

Looking back, the IR for option C would have a strong peak at 1700 (ester carbonyl) and 1650 (conjugated double bond). The NMR has vinyls, so that fits.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. Let me think about the possible structures for C6H10O2.

Assuming the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's five carbons for the ester (CH2=CHCOO has three carbons, and the R' is three carbons). So total is six carbons. So that would fit option C.

Now, what's the molecular weight of that ester? The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12 +10*1 +2*16=72 +10 +32=114.

In the mass spectrum, the fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the ester breaks off into the RCOO group and the R' group, perhaps leaving a smaller fragment.

Wait, the m/z 45 could correspond to (CH3)2O, but that's 46, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe a fragment from the vinyl group.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, perhaps a fragment forms when the ester breaks into the acrylate part and the alkoxy part. Let's think about the possible fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the acrylate group. The acrylate ion (CH2=CHCOO-) has a molecular weight of (3*12) + (4*1) + (2*16) = 36 +4 +32=72. But that's higher than 45.

Hmm, another thought: the fragment could be the result of the ester cleavage. For example, if the ester breaks between the carbonyl and the oxygen, it would form a ketene ion.

A ketene ion has the structure RCO+, where R is an alkyl group. The mass of the ketene ion would be the mass of RCO.

So, if the fragment is m/z 45, then RCO's mass is 45. So RCO is (12 +16) + R's mass. Wait, 12 +16 is 28, so R's mass would be 17. But R is an alkyl group, whose mass is (12a +1b), where a is the number of carbons and b is the number of hydrogens.

Wait, 17 is a small mass. Let's see: 12*1 =12, so 12 + (something) =17. So if R is methyl (15), then RCO would be 15 +28=43, which is not 45. If R is ethyl (29), RCO would be 29 +28=57. Hmm, no. So maybe this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the cleavage of the vinyl group. For instance, the CH2=CHCOO group could break into CH2=CHCOO- and the rest. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is from the loss of the ester group. For example, if the ester group (COOCH2CH2CH3) is lost, the remaining part would be CH2=CH2, which has a molecular weight of 28. But that's not 45.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas and their compatibility with the data.

The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group. So the compound must have an -OH, which requires O. The 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl, so O again. So the compound must have at least two O's, which points to options A and C.

So, between A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

Now, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond.

Looking at the degree of unsaturation:

Option A: degree 1 → either a ring or a double bond. But since NMR shows a double bond, it must have that. So option A could be a compound with a double bond and two O's.

Option C: degree 2 → either two rings, one ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the presence of a conjugated carbonyl (if the IR peak at 1650 is a conjugated double bond) would require a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So the structure would have a conjugated diene, but that's unlikely because the NMR only mentions vinyl hydrogens, not necessarily all the protons from a diene. Alternatively, the structure could have a single double bond conjugated with the carbonyl.

Wait, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, then the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl, which would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is the carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

So the presence of such a structure would fit with the IR data. So let's think about the mass spectrum again.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (that's for option C: C6H10O2?), wait, let's count the H's.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3:

Carbon chain: CH2=CH (2 C), COO (2 O), CH2CH2CH3 (3 C). So total C: 2+3 + (3 from COO?), no, wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. So the structure is (CH2=CHCOO)-O-(CH2CH2CH3). So the COO is part of the ester. The carbonyl is in the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that's less likely.

But perhaps the fragment comes from the cleavage of the ester. For example, the ester could break into the acrylate part and the alcohol part.

Alternatively, if the ester breaks between the carbonyl and oxygen, releasing a ketene ion.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is from the vinyl group. If the fragment is CH2=CH2, that's 28, but the mass is 45. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: possible common fragments. m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think of possible ions.

The most common is (CH3)2CHOH (which is 58?), no. Another possibility is the propyl group, but that's 45? Let me calculate: CH2CH2CH3 has a mass of 45? 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 7 hydrogens (since CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, which has 7 H? Wait, no: CH2CH2CH3 is actually C3H7, which is 7 H. So 3*12=36, 7*1=7, so 43. But that's not 45.

Alternatively, (CH2)2O is 44 (24+4 +16=44). So that's close. Or maybe (CH3O)2, which is 76? No, that's higher.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion. The molecular weight of the compound is 114 for option C (C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10+32=114). So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. But the question states that the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45, not the molecular ion.

So, the fragment at 45 must be a smaller part of the molecule. Let's think of possible ways to get a fragment of 45.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, perhaps the fragment is the pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group breaks off, leaving the alkyne part.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the mass fragment. Let me think of another approach: the molecular formula and possible functional groups.

The compound has an O-H group (broad peak), a carbonyl (ester), and a double bond (vinyl Hs). So the structure is likely a diol ester or an ester with a double bond and an OH group.

Wait, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would be C6H12O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again. The presence of a broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H, and a peak at 1700 suggests carbonyl. So the compound must have both.

So, the possible structures are either an ester with an alcohol (but that would require two O's), which fits options A and C.

But if the structure is an ester with an alcohol group elsewhere, that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl alcohol ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. Let's see: that would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible number of rings and double bonds.

Option C has two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, that could use up both degrees.

But the presence of an O-H group would require another O, making the formula C6H10O2.

Wait, but a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a ring and a carbonyl, which would account for two degrees of unsaturation (ring and carbonyl). But then, where would the double bond come in? Maybe the ring is a cyclopropane with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an O-H.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

The mass fragment at 45 is a key clue. What is a common fragment with m/z 45? Let me think of the possible ions.

45 could be (CH3)2CHOH (but that's 58), no. Alternatively, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, so no. Wait, maybe it's the acetylium ion (CH3CO+)? Let's see: CH3CO+ is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16=24+3+16=43). Close to 45 but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the result of some other cleavage.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the methyl group of an ester. Wait, methyl group is 15. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, if the ester is ethyl something, the fragment could be from the ethyl group. Ethyl is 46 (C2H5), but 45 is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 45. Wait, (CH3)2O is 15 (CH3) *2 =30 for carbon and hydrogen, plus 16 for O → 46. No, that's 46, not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44. (12*2 + 1*4 +16=24+4+16=44). Close to 45 but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps it's a different group. Let me think of (CH3)CO+ which is 43. So 43 is close to 45.

Wait, what if the fragment is (CH2)3O, which would be 12*3 +1*6 +16=36 +6 +16=58. No, that's not 45.

Another approach: the molecular formula of the fragment is C3H7O. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16 → 36+7+16=59. Not 45.

Alternatively, C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45 → yes! So the fragment could be C2H5O, which has a molecular weight of 45.

So the fragment could be an ethyl group with an oxygen, like OCH2CH3 or something similar. So that suggests that the ester group is an ethyl ester. Because the ester's R group is ethyl (OCH2CH3), upon fragmentation, that part could cleave.

Wait, in the ester structure RCOOR', when the R' group breaks off, it would leave the RCOO- group. But the R' group, being ethyl, is OCH2CH3 (mass 45). So, perhaps the fragment at m/z 45 is the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) losing the rest.

Wait, but OCH2CH3 has a mass of 45? Let's calculate: O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15 (12+3*1 for CH2) + (12 +3*1 for CH3) → wait, no. CH2CH3 is 15 (12+3=15 for CH2?), no:

Wait, OCH2CH3 is:

O:16, CH2:14 (12 +2*1), CH3:15 (12 +3*1). So O + CH2CH3 = 16 + (12 +2) + (12 +3) = 16 +14 +15=45.

Ah, so the fragment could be the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) with a mass of 45.

That would suggest that the ester group is an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3). So R' is ethyl.

So, putting this together, the compound is RCOOCH2CH3, where R is a group with an O-H and a double bond.

Wait, but the compound must have an O-H group (from the broad IR peak). So R must have an -OH group.

So, R would be something like CH2CH2-OH, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps R is a propenoic acid group, but that's getting too specific.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, let's check the molecular formula:

HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH3 → that's:

HO-CH2CH2-COO-O-CH2CH3 → so the formula would be C5H10O3. But our options are C6H10O2, C6H12O2, etc. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about the options again.

Options A and C are the only ones with two O's. So the correct answer must be one of them.

The presence of a fragment at 45 suggests that the ester is an ethyl ester (since the ethyl group is 45). So the R' group in RCOOR' is ethyl.

So, the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be (R is (n) carbons, so RCOO is (n+2) carbons, but the overall formula is C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

So, RCOOCH2CH3 has (n+2 + 2) carbons. Wait, RCOO is (n+1) carbons (R is n-1, since RCOO is R plus two more carbons?), I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, RCOOCH2CH3: R is a group with x carbons. RCOO is (x+1) carbons. CH2CH3 is 2 carbons. So total is (x+1)+2 = x+3. So for the total to be 6 carbons, x+3=6 → x=3. So R is a 3-carbon group.

So R is a propyl group? No, wait. RCOO would be 4 carbons if R is 3. So RCOO is (3 carbons in R) + 2 (COO) → 5 carbons? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, if RCOO is 4 carbons (so R is 3 carbons), then RCOOCH2CH3 would have 4+2=6 carbons. So R is a 3-carbon group.

So, R is a three-carbon group with an O-H and a double bond.

Wait, R is a three-carbon group (like CH2=CHCH2-OH?), but that would make the formula C6H12O3, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a two-carbon group. RCOO would be 3 carbons. Then RCOOCH2CH3 would have 3+2=5 carbons. But our options are six, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the structure isn't RCOOCH2CH3 but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester of a diol, but that's getting complicated.

Another approach: let's consider the options and their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2 → an ester with a cyclic structure or a double bond and an OH group.

Option C: C6H10O2 → an ester with a double bond and an OH group, perhaps with more rings or double bonds.

The presence of the fragment at 45 being OCH2CH3 suggests that the ester is ethyl. So the R' group is ethyl.

So, the correct option must have an ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3), which contributes two O's. Wait, no—the ester group comes from RCOOR', which contributes two O's (the ester group is O-CO-O).

Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-O, so the formula for the ester is RCOOR'. So option A is C6H12O2, which would have the ester group and an OH elsewhere.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester. But that would require more O's.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to sum up:

- Broad peak at 3000: O-H (alcohol)
- 1700 cm^-1: ester carbonyl
- 1650 cm^-1: conjugated double bond (so a double bond next to the carbonyl)
- Vinyl hydrogens in NMR: indicates a double bond
- Fragment at 45 in mass spec: suggests OCH2CH3 (ethyl group)
- So the structure is likely an ethyl ester with a conjugated double bond and an alcohol group.

But the molecular formula must fit. So for option C, the formula is C6H10O2. If the structure is, say, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, that would be C6H10O2, but wait, let me count:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → C6 (CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons, OCH2CH2CH3 is 3, total 7? No, wait:

Wait, CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons (CH2=CH-COO-). Then the OCH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons. So total is 3+3=6 carbons. So that fits option C.

The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let me count the H's: 

CH2=CHCOO-O-CH2CH2CH3 → The ester is O-CO-O, so the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

The formula: 

CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons: CH2=CH-C-O-O- 

Wait, no, the ester is CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So the formula is:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → (each group):

CH2=CHCOO: 3 carbons, 3 H (from CH2=CH) and the COO has O's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula:

Each CH2=CHCOO- group: 3 carbons, 3 H (from CH2=CH) and 2 O.

The R' group is CH2CH2CH3: 3 carbons, 7 H (since it's a propyl group).

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact H count. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that option C would have the necessary features.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C).

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This is consistent with an **ethyl group (OCH₂CH₃)**, which has a mass of 45.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degree of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
   - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Degree of unsaturation = 2 (two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
   - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degree of unsaturation = 2 (two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
   - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Degree of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).

### Elimination of Options:
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:
  - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group observed in the IR spectrum. Thus, **D is eliminated**.

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:
  - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which also cannot account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group. Thus, **B is eliminated**.

- **Options A (C₆H₁₂O₂)** and **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:
  - Both formulas have two oxygen atoms, which can account for the O-H and carbonyl groups. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR indicates at least one double bond, and the degree of unsaturation for both options allows for this.

### Final Comparison Between A and C:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:
  - Degree of unsaturation = 1, which could correspond to a single double bond or a ring. However, the IR spectrum suggests a conjugated system (peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹), which is more consistent with two degrees of unsaturation.

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:
  - Degree of unsaturation = 2, which can account for both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond. The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** in the mass spectrum is consistent with an ethyl ester group (OCH₂CH₃), which fits this formula.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms, a conjugated system (C=O and C=C), and an ethyl ester group (OCH₂CH₃). This is best represented by **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
