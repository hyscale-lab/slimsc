Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, first, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Oh right, when spots are present, they are cooler regions, so the star's overall emission decreases. But the question is about the photosphere's temperature when spots are present. Oh wait, wait. No, the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. So the photosphere's Teff is 5500 K in that case.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when there are spots, the Teff is 5500 K, and the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when Teff is 6000 K. So we're looking at the ratio at 6000 K versus the same ratio at 5500 K. Oh wait no, wait. The question is about the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

So the ratio N1/N2 when no spots is R1, and when spots are present is R2. So the factor is R1 / R2.

But wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The ratio of N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So R2 (with spots) is less than R1 (no spots). So R1 > R2, so R1/R2 would be a number greater than 1. The question is, by what factor? So we're looking for (R1 / R2).

But wait, the ratio R is N1/N2. Let me write the formula.

R = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Let me think about E2 - E1. The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is about 0.1448 microns. So that's in the near ultraviolet or visible range. The energy difference can be found using E = hc/lambda.

So E = hc/lambda. The Rydberg constant and such, but let's compute it.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but wait, energy in terms of eV? Because Boltzmann's constant is easier in eV per K when dealing with thermal energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the energy in terms of eV. Let's see.

1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV would be (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, E is E2 - E1, and that's the energy difference per photon. So in the Boltzmann factor, (E2 - E1)/(k T) would be this energy difference divided by k*T.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for both T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

First, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV, as per above.

So for T=6000 K:

(E)/(k T) = 8.57 eV / ( (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 6000 K ) )

Calculate denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 0.51702 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.51702 ≈ 16.59.

Similarly for T=5500 K:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 * 5.5e3 = 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.473935 ≈ 18.10.

Wait, so for T=6000 K, the exponent is -16.59, and for T=5500 K, it's -18.10.

So the ratio R is proportional to exp( -(E)/(k T) )

Wait, the ratio without spots (T=6000) is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -16.59 )

With spots (T=5500) is R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -18.10 )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( -16.59 + 18.10 ) = exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51.

Wait, e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.51 is a bit higher. Let me compute that.

e^1.51: Let's see, e^1=2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So 2.718 *1.6487 ≈ 4.48. For 1.51, let's do a linear approximation. The derivative of e^x is e^x. At x=1.5, e^1.5 is ~4.48. So for x=1.51, the increase is about 0.01 * 4.48 = 0.0448, so ~4.525.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation of (E2-E1)/(k T). Because E = hc/lambda, but I just did E in eV.

Wait, E = hc/(lambda). Let me recompute that to ensure.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. That seems correct.

So for T=6000 K, (E)/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000 )

Wait, 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K = 0.517 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58. So correct.

Similarly, for T=5500 K: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.

8.57 / 0.473935 ≈ 18.09.

So R1 = g1/g2 * exp( -16.58 )

R2 = g1/g2 * exp( -18.09 )

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp( ( -16.58 ) - ( -18.09 ) ) = exp( 1.51 ) ≈ 4.52.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So R2 < R1.

Which would make R1/R2 ≈ 4.5, which is one of the options, option C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the ratio R is N1/N2. As T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp( -x ) becomes smaller. So R decreases, which aligns with the observed decrease when spots are present.

So the factor is R1/R2 ≈ 4.5. So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, is the energy E2 - E1 or E1 - E2?

Wait, the energy difference is E2 - E1. So in the Boltzmann factor, it's exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is exp( - (E) / (k T) ), where E is positive. So if E is positive, then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the entire term decreases. So the ratio N1/N2 would decrease when T decreases, which matches the problem's statement.

So R1 is for T=6000 K, R2 is for T=5500 K. R1 = g1/g2 exp(-16.58)

R2 = g1/g2 exp(-18.09)

So R1/R2 = exp( ( -16.58 ) - ( -18.09 )) = exp( 1.51 )

Which is about 4.52, so approximately 4.5. So option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation for population ratios in LTE:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference Calculation**:  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
   \[
   E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Factor for Each Temperature**:  
   For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 6000} \approx 16.59.
   \]
   For \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots present):
   \[
   \frac{E}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 5500} \approx 18.10.
   \]

3. **Ratio of Ratios**:  
   The ratio of populations is proportional to \( \exp(-\frac{E}{kT}) \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1} + \frac{E}{kT_2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{E}{k} \approx 16.59 \, \text{at} \, 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( \frac{E}{k} \approx 18.10 \, \text{at} \, 5500 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(18.10 - 16.59\right) = \exp(1.51).
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**:  
   Using \( \exp(1.51) \approx 4.52 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes (no spots vs. spots) is approximately **4.5**.
