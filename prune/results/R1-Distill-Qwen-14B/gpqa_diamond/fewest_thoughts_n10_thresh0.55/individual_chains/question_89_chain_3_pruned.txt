Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and then several products are formed through different reactions. The final question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's start with the first step. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction is happening here. When a dihalide is treated with a base, E2 elimination can occur, forming an alkene. Since the molecule is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would likely lead to the formation of an alkene between the two bromine atoms. So, the product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane or perhaps an adamantene structure, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Wait, Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a structure of four cyclohexane rings fused together, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

Heating with KOH would deprotonate and eliminate the Br- leaving groups. So, elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or more accurately, an adamantene structure with a double bond between C1 and C3. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diene in the adamantane framework. But I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh wait, maybe it's actually 1,3-dibromo, which is not adjacent. Wait, but elimination usually requires adjacent leaving groups. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a different arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps heating with KOH leads to a double elimination, forming an alkene. But I'm not
