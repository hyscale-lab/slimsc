Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The population of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature. The formula I recall is the ratio of populations between two energy levels, n_upper and n_lower, given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. Wait, no. Actually, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So for a specific energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the question says in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So the ratio (n1)/(n2) = 2. 

But wait, the energy difference ΔE is given, so
