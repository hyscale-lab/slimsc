Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are vectors in a Hilbert space, and |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So I think I'll first need to normalize this state because the problem mentions it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself. Let's write out the state as |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 is (1+i) and c2 is (2-i). 

The inner product <alpha|alpha> would be |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So |c1|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2. And |c2|^2 is (2-i)(2+i) =4 +1 =5. Adding them together, 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with a specific matrix representation. The operator's matrix Aij is given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, I should think about what this matrix looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (assuming we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, so two states), the matrix would be:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0   ]

Wait, no, because if i≠j, the elements are hbar/2. So for a 2x2 case, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of an operator are the states you measure when you measure the observable corresponding to that operator.
