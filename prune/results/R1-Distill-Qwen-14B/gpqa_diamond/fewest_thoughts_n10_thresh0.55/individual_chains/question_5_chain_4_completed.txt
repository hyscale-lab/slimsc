Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, first I should probably write down each of these matrices.

So, P_x is ħ/2 multiplied by the matrix:
[0 1]
[1 0]

Similarly, P_y is ħ/2 times:
[0 -i]
[i  0]

And P_z is ħ/2 times:
[1  0]
[0 -1]

The operator we're interested in is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the X-Z plane. So, the direction vector n can be written in terms of spherical coordinates. Since it's in the X-Z plane, the angle phi (φ) is zero because it's measured from the Z-axis around the Y-axis. Wait, no, wait. Wait, phi is the angle in the azimuthal direction, right? So in the X-Z plane, phi would be 0 or pi. Wait, no, if it's any direction in the X-Z plane, phi can be 0, pi/2, etc. Wait, no, the X-Z plane is the plane where y=0, so the direction vector would be in the form (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in X-Z, perhaps φ is 0 or 180 degrees? No, wait, maybe any φ because X-Z plane is where y=0, so phi can be anything, but theta is the angle from the Z-axis.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The direction vector n lies in the X-Z plane. That means the vector has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ would be measured from the Z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 because the direction is along the X-Z plane. Wait, no, because in the X-Z plane, the direction can have any phi, as long as it's in that plane. Wait, no, the direction in the X-Z plane would have phi = 0 or phi = π, depending on whether it's in the positive or negative X direction. Wait, but more generally, any direction in the X-Z plane can be described with phi varying, but theta being the angle from the Z-axis.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The operator P is along direction n, so the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the X-Z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me define n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = sinθ sinφ, but since it's in X-Z, maybe phi is 0. Wait, no, because being in the X-Z plane just means that the y-component is zero, but phi can be any angle, right?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. For a direction in the X-Z plane, the spherical coordinates would have phi = 0, because phi is measured around the Z-axis. So for example, when phi is 0, the direction is along the positive X direction, and when phi is 180 degrees, it's along the negative X. But in the X-Z plane, you can also have directions like (1,0,1), which would have phi=45 degrees or something. Wait, no, because the X-Z plane is the plane where y=0, so the spherical coordinates can have any phi, but theta is measured from the Z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = sinθ sinφ, and n_y=0.

Wait, but the problem states that n is an arbitrary direction in the X-Z plane, so I can represent it as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But perhaps for this problem, since the eigenvector's form is to be found, I don't need the exact direction but to find the eigenvector in terms of theta and phi, or maybe in terms of some other angles.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the operator is P, which is along direction n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait, the operator components are given as P_x, P_y, P_z, each being 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along direction n is:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z

Since n is in the X-Z plane, and a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So, substituting P_x and P_z:

P = (n_x * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

= [(n_z * ħ/2), (n_x * ħ/2)]
  [ (n_x * ħ/2), (-n_z * ħ/2) ]

Because the first element comes from (n_z * ħ/2)*1 + 0, the (1,2) element is (n_x * ħ/2)*1, etc.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-calculate that. The matrix should be:

Each element (i,j) is the sum of the corresponding elements from P_x and P_z multiplied by their coefficients.

So:

P = (n_x (ħ/2) ) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the (1,1) element is 0 + (n_z ħ/2)*1 = n_z ħ/2

(1,2) element is (n_x ħ/2)*1 + 0 = n_x ħ/2

(2,1) element is same as (1,2) because P_x is symmetric, so n_x ħ/2

(2,2) element is 0 + (-n_z ħ/2)*1 = -n_z ħ/2

So P is:

[ n_z (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2) ]
[ n_x (ħ/2), -n_z (ħ/2) ]

Alternatively, factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So, substituting P:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) * [ a; b ]

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, but perhaps I should write it as:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which gives:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the ħ/2 factor:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me re-arrange these equations.

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the rearrangement again.

Equation 1: n_z a + n_x b = a → n_z a - a + n_x b = 0 → a (n_z - 1) + b n_x = 0

Equation 2: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - n_z b - b = 0 → n_x a + b (-n_z - 1) = 0

So we have two equations:

(1) a (n_z - 1) + b n_x = 0
(2) a n_x - b (n_z + 1) = 0

We can write this as a system:

a (n_z - 1) + b n_x = 0
a n_x - b (n_z + 1) = 0

Let me try to solve these equations. Let's take equation 1:

a (n_z - 1) = - b n_x → a = ( - b n_x ) / (n_z - 1 )

Substituting this into equation 2:

[ (- b n_x ) / (n_z - 1) ) ] * n_x - b (n_z + 1) = 0

Multiply through:

- b n_x^2 / (n_z - 1) - b (n_z + 1) = 0

Factor out -b:

- b [ n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (n_z + 1) ) ] = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since if b=0, from equation 1 a would be zero too, which is trivial and not an eigenvector), we have:

n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (n_z + 1) ) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

n_x^2 + (n_z + 1)(n_z - 1) ) = 0

Expand (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z² -1

So:

n_x² + n_z² -1 = 0

But since n is a unit vector in the X-Z plane, n_x² + n_z² =1. So 1 -1 =0 → 0=0, which holds.

So the equations are consistent, and the eigenvector can be found from equation 1.

From equation 1: a = [ -b n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

We can choose b as a parameter, say set b =1, then a = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

But perhaps a better approach is to express a and b in terms of some angle, considering the direction n.

Wait, but n lies in the X-Z plane, so we can parameterize n using theta and phi. Wait, earlier I thought n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector is:

n = ( sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ )

Wait, no, wait. Spherical coordinates have the polar angle θ measured from the positive Z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ measured around the Z-axis. So in that case, the unit vector is:

n_x = sinθ cosφ
n_y = sinθ sinφ
n_z = cosθ

But wait, in our case, since the direction is in the X-Z plane, n_y =0. So n_y = sinθ sinφ =0 → sinφ=0 → φ=0 or π.

But wait, that would restrict the direction to either along the positive X (φ=0) or negative X (φ=π), but that's only a subset of the X-Z plane. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no. Wait, no, because if n is in the X-Z plane, then n_y =0, so from spherical coordinates, that implies that sinθ sinφ=0. So either sinθ=0 (which would be the Z-axis) or sinφ=0 (so φ=0 or π). So the direction can be along the positive X (φ=0, θ=90 degrees), negative X (φ=π, θ=90), positive Z (θ=0, any φ), or negative Z (θ=180, any φ).

Wait, but the problem says an 'arbitrary' direction in the X-Z plane. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, maybe I should parameterize the direction in the X-Z plane using just one angle, say θ, measured from the Z-axis. So the direction would have:

n_x = sinθ cosφ
n_z = cosθ

But wait, that would still allow for any φ. So perhaps for our purposes, since the operator depends on n_x and n_z, which are sinθ cosφ and cosθ, respectively.

Wait, perhaps I should express n as:

n_x = sinθ cosφ
n_z = cosθ

So, substituting into the matrix P.

But perhaps it's easier to express a and b in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, but looking at the eigenvector equations, maybe I can express the eigenvector in terms of the spin-up state along the direction n.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But wait, in our case, since n is in the X-Z plane, the angle phi might be zero. Because if the direction is in the X-Z plane, phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if n is in X-Z, then phi can be 0 or π, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. For the X-Z plane, the y-component is zero, so in spherical coordinates, phi is 0 or pi, because sin(theta) sin(phi) = 0 implies phi=0 or pi. So the direction can be along positive X (phi=0), negative X (phi=pi), positive Z (theta=0), or negative Z (theta=pi).

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed.

The eigenvector for spin-up along n is usually:

cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

But in the X-Z plane, phi is 0 or pi. So let's see.

In this case, perhaps the eigenvector would be:

cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

But wait, in our case, since the operator is along n, which is in the X-Z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. So e^{i phi} would be either 1 or -1.

Wait, maybe that's the case, but perhaps I should proceed without assuming specific phi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the eigenvector in terms of the equations we have.

From the first equation:

a (n_z -1) + b n_x =0 → a (n_z -1) = -b n_x → a = (-b n_x)/(n_z -1 )

Let me express a in terms of b. Let's say b is a parameter, then a is determined. We can choose b=1 for simplicity, then a = (-n_x)/(n_z -1 )

But we can write this as a = (n_x)/(1 -n_z )

Because (n_z -1) = -(1 -n_z ), so (-n_x)/(n_z-1 ) = n_x/(1 -n_z )

So a = n_x/(1 -n_z )

Now, let's write the components of the eigenvector as:

a = n_x / (1 -n_z )

b = 1

Wait, but we need to normalize the eigenvector. The norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (n_x^2)/( (1 -n_z )^2 ) + 1 =1

So,

(n_x^2)/(1 -n_z )^2 +1 =1 → (n_x^2)/(1 -n_z )^2 =0 → n_x must be zero, which isn't possible except for n along Z.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a and b such that the equations are satisfied and then normalize.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvectors can be expressed using the direction's angles.

Wait, another approach: The eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are known. Since the operator P along n is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ·n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

Wait, yes! Because the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ). Since n is in the X-Z plane, n_y=0, so P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

The eigenvalues of this operator are ± ħ/2, as expected for spin-½ systems.

The eigenstates (eigenvectors) are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n.

The spin-up state along n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓>

Wait, but in our case, since n is in the X-Z plane, phi is 0 or pi, as before.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, since n is in X-Z, phi is zero or pi, so the state simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the eigenvector in terms of theta and phi, but since the problem gives options, perhaps I can look for the correct form.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Which seems familiar, but without complex phases.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Hmm.

Wait, but the eigenvectors of spin-½ systems along a direction n are typically expressed as:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

So, in terms of components, the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But since the problem says the direction is in the X-Z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. So, if phi=0, the eigenvector components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

If phi=pi, then e^{i phi}= -1, so components would be (cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) )

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches the case when phi=0.

Alternatively, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match the standard spin-up state.

Wait, but the eigenvectors are normalized, so the sum of squares of the absolute values is 1.

In the standard spin-up state along n, the components are:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

Which is option C if phi=0.

But looking for the normalized eigenvector, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but let me check the dimensions. The options have terms with ħ, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless, because they are vectors in a Hilbert space. So options A and D have terms with ħ, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector. So options A and D can be eliminated.

So between options B, C, and possibly D.

Wait, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but also includes a cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But why would there be sqrt factors here? Because when in the X-Z plane, perhaps the eigenvector depends on theta but not phi.

Wait, but if the direction is in the X-Z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Let's say phi=0, then the eigenvector becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Alternatively, if phi=pi, it would be (cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ), but that's not among the options.

So, option C seems to fit.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the norm would be |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 =1, which holds. So option C is normalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector's components are given without the phase factor. So, option C is the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, meaning $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = +\hbar/2 |v\rangle$. Substituting $P$ and simplifying, we find the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$ in terms of $n_x$ and $n_z$. After normalization, the eigenvector is expressed as:

\[
|v\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) |↑\rangle + e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2) |↓\rangle,
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle (measured from the z-axis) and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (measured around the z-axis). Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$ or $\phi = \pi$, depending on the direction. For simplicity, we assume $\phi = 0$, so the eigenvector components become:

\[
|v\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) |↑\rangle + \sin(\theta/2) |↓\rangle.
\]

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This option includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of a quantum mechanical eigenvector (dimensionless components). Hence, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
   This form does not match the standard spin-up state along a direction $\vec{n}$, which involves $\theta/2$ instead of $\theta$. Hence, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the standard spin-up state along a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane when $\phi = 0$. The components are normalized, and the dependence on $\theta/2$ is correct. This option is consistent with the problem.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   Similar to Option A, this includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of a quantum mechanical eigenvector. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by Option C: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
