Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stability constants and complex formation can be a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step. The question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate, and we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, first, let me read the problem again carefully. The setup is a solution with Co(II) ions and SCN- ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, sometimes the nomenclature can be confusing. Let me think: Co with SCN ligands forms complexes like Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), so for n=1, 2, 3, 4. The blue ones are likely the ones with two SCN- ions, I think. Or wait, I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a common complex, but I'm not entirely sure about the colors. Oh, but the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) species. So that's the one we're focusing on.

Stability constants (beta) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the beta for each complex is given as beta1 to beta4. Wait, let me make sure I understand what each beta represents. For example, beta1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, since it's the first addition of SCN- to Co^2+. So the formation step would be Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^+, with beta1 = [Co(SCN)^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, beta2 is for the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+; the formation from the first complex would be Co(SCN)^+
