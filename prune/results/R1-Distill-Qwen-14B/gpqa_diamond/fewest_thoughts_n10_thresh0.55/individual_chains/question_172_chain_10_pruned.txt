Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when we're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of different energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like (n_j / n_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i) / (k*T) ). Here, n_j and n_i are the number densities of states j and i, g_j and g_i are their statistical weights, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, it's given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. I think they're comparing the ratios of the excited state to some lower state. Since it's a specific energy level, perhaps the lower state is the ground state or another common reference.

Let me denote the ratio of excitation as n₁/n₂ = 2, where n₁ is for star_1 and n₂ for star_2. Wait, no, actually, the problem says the excitation in star_1
