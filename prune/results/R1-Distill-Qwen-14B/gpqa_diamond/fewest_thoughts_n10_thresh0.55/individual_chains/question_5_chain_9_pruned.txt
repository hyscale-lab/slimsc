Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.

The given components are P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them out.

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2. So that's (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

P_y matrix: [[0,-i],[i,0]] multiplied by ħ/2. So (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]].

P_z matrix: [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2. So (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Wait, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. Oh right, the standard Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by ħ/2 gives the components of the spin operator S. But in this case, the operator P seems to be similar. So P must be the spin operator, perhaps. So the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

But wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n, so the operator would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Because any direction can be expressed as a combination of the components.

So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ perhaps? Or maybe n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, depending on how it's defined. Well, I
