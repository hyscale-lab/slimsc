Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. The compound has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. 

When heated with excess KOH (a strong base), it probably undergoes an elimination reaction. KOH is a good base and a strong nucleophile. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with a base would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. So, the product 1 would be the elimination productâ€”a diene maybe? Wait, or just a single double bond because it's 1,3-dibromo, which upon elimination would form 1,3-adamantadiene? Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure of adamantane. Alternatively, maybe it's one double bond.

Looking at the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet? Wait, no, it's written as 4.79(2H), but the splitting isn't specified. Wait, the question says the 1H NMR has these signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but if product 1 comes from elimination, that should form a double bond, not a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, maybe the base is doing something else, like a substitution. Wait, but substitution of two bromines with hydroxide? That would give 1,3-diol. But then the IR would show OH stretches, which are usually broad. But the IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps elimination isn't the first step. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes an elimination to form a ketone? How? Oh, wait! Maybe it's a Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) or some kind of elimination leading to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Wait, another thought: heating dibromides with a strong base like KOH can sometimes lead to the formation of epoxides, but that's in cyclic ethers. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a carbonyl in product 1. So product 1 is a ketone. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH (maybe under some elimination conditions) forms a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a ketone formation. Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon elimination, it forms a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the base causes an oxidation if there's an adjacent position. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution, but that would give a diol, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more like a neighboring group participation. Wait, no, adamantane is a saturated structure, so maybe that's not applicable. Alternatively, maybe the base is removing a bromide and the molecule undergoes some kind of ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, another angle: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, might form an epoxide, but I don't think so. Epoxides usually come from vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromides). Since this is 1,3, perhaps it's not forming an epoxide.

Wait, let me think about the IR peak. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Could product 1
