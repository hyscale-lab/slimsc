Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration has always been a little tricky for me. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The problem gives me some volumes and concentrations, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, okay, let's see.

First, I'll try to write down what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH, a strong base, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction should look something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. Right.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). I think I should calculate the new concentration after dilution first.

Molarity after dilution is (M1V1)/(V1+V2). So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L, V2 is 0.02 L. So M = (0.05 * 0.02) / (0.04) = (0.001)/0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, wait. Because when you mix two solutions, the moles of acetic acid stay the same, but the volume increases. So moles of acetic acid before dilution: M1 * V1 = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So when we titrate, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So the equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (as above). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equivalence is 10 cm³, so 25
