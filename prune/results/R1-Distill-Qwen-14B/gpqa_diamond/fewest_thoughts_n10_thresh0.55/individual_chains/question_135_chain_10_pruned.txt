Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves the decay of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by a Lagrangian term, but I think the key thing here is to figure out which fermions X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps the structure of the Lagrangian tells me which fermions X can interact with. The term has ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, so that's the fermion field. So, X couples to fermions, but which ones?

Wait, the fermions in the interaction term should be the ones that X can decay into. So, if the interaction is Yukawa-like, then X can mediate the interaction between these fermions. So the fermions that appear in the Lagrangian are the ones that X can couple to, hence the possible decay products.

But wait, the fermions available in the Standard Model are quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau). But the interaction term given in the question uses ψ_f, which I think refers to a fermion field. So, the fermions that are in the loop or in the interaction are the ones that X can
