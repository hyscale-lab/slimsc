Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance (r) increases, the parallax decreases. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r. So r is in parsecs, I think.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/plx^5. So mathematically, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which simplifies to 1/(1/r^5) or r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for each small increase in r, the number of stars added (the change) would be related to the derivative of N with respect to r.

Let me think. N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. The rate of change of N with respect to r is dN/dr = 5k * r^4. So the change in number of stars per unit change in r is proportional to r^4. But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the correct answer because the question is phrased a bit differently.

Wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So maybe it's asking for the density of stars as a function of r, which would be dN/dr. Because per unit distance, it's the derivative.

So dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer would be C?

Wait, but wait, I should make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/pl
