Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me see. I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but I think they have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe.

The question gives me some details about each star and the telescopes. So, let's break it down. First, I need to figure out the apparent V magnitude of each star because that's what determines if they can be observed by each spectrograph.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. That means any star with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, right? Because lower magnitude is brighter. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be magnitude less than 17, right? Because the scale is a bit counterintuitive. So if a star is 16 mag, that's brighter than 17 mag. So the limit is: ESPRESSO observes stars with V ≤17 mag. Because higher magnitude is fainter. So any star with V mag brighter than 17 is V ≤17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same logic, if a star's apparent V magnitude is ≤16, then HIRES can see it. Because stars brighter than 16 mag would have V <16, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO, which I think would mean V <17, because brighter means lower magnitude. Similarly, HIRES observes stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So, if a star is brighter than 17, that means it has a lower apparent magnitude. So for example, a star with V=16 would be brighter than 17, so it would be observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, which would be those with V <16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's worded, I think it's the other way around. The statement is: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So for a star to be detectable, its V mag must be ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17, its V is less than 17. Similarly for HIRES, stars with V mag <16 can be observed.

So, in order for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (since HIRES requires V <16). Wait, no. Wait, because if a star is dimmer than 16 mag, it can't be seen by HIRES, but if it's brighter than 16 mag, it's >=16, which ESPRESSO can't see if it
