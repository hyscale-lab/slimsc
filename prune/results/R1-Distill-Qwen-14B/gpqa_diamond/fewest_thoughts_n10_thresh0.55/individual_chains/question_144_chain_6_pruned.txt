Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their lifetimes and speeds. Oh right, the mean decay distance is how far the meson travels before decaying. So, I think I need to find the lifetime first and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

But wait, how do I get the lifetime? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait. The width is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. I need to make sure I convert units properly.

Wait, let's think step by step. The width Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, the reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. I think that's right. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that again. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-
