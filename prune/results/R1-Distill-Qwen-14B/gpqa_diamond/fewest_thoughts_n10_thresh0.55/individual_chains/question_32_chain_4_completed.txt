Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X actually is. Wait, Li is lithium. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, right? Because the standard lithium isotope is Li-6 with 3 neutrons, and Li-7 has 4. But wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's correct. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds. Since the speed is 0.96c, that's pretty high, so relativistic effects are significant. The energy involved here is probably the total relativistic energy of the nucleus, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

In colliders, the energy given is typically the kinetic energy of the particles. Wait no, wait. In some contexts, especially when dealing with high energies, the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) is considered. But for heavy ions, the rest mass energy is a significant part. Hmm. I think I need to calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy.

Right, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy (mc²). And the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc². But I'm not sure whether the problem is asking for the total or kinetic energy. The wording says "energy of the RHIC", which is typically the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the energy in a collider is usually the kinetic energy. So if the RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain speed, the energy we're looking for is the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes people refer to the total energy. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed assuming it's the total energy. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy. Let's clarify. The problem states, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is typically the kinetic energy. So I think it's the kinetic energy that we're being asked about.

So the plan is to compute the kinetic energy. But wait, I might be wrong. Let me think again. The total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So depending on what the question is asking, it could be either. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So it's about the energy that brings the nucleus up to 0.96c. So perhaps it's the kinetic energy that's needed. But wait, sometimes when you're given the speed, you calculate the total energy because the rest mass energy is part of the total. Hmm. Let's proceed with the two possibilities and see.

First, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

v = 0.96c
Then, v²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216
So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784)
So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus X is m*c². So I need to find the mass m of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li has an atomic number of 3, and Li-6 has 3 neutrons, so mass number is 6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, minus the binding energy (but for approximate calculation, perhaps we can just take the mass number times the mass of a nucleon). Alternatively, for more precision, using the actual mass of the isotope.

But wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 atom is known. Let me recall that. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015166 atomic mass units (u). Because the exact mass can be found in tables, but I think I can look up that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.015166 u (since each Li-6 atom has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons, but wait, no, wait. The nucleus is just the protons and neutrons. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons minus the binding energy, but perhaps it's easier to look up the exact mass number.

Alternatively, for a nucleus with mass number A, the approximate mass is A u, but more accurately, we can use the exact value from known isotopes.

Wait, the problem gives that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.015166 u. Let me double-check that number. Yeah, I think that's right.

So the rest energy is m c². Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², so m c² is 6.015166 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that. 6.015166 * 931.5 ≈ ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.015166 * 931.5 ≈ 14.12 MeV
So total is approximately 5589 + 14.12 = 5603.12 MeV, which is 5.60312 GeV.

So m c² ≈ 5.60312 GeV.

Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714. So the total energy E is gamma * m c² ≈ 3.5714 * 5.60312 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3 * 5.60312 = 16.80936
0.5714 * 5.60312 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.60312=2.80156, 0.0714 *5.60312≈0.40127, so total ≈ 2.80156 + 0.40127 = 3.20283

So total E ≈ 16.80936 + 3.20283 ≈ 20.0122 GeV.

But wait, that's the total energy. What about the kinetic energy? Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is about 3.5714, so gamma -1 is 2.5714.

So KE ≈ 2.5714 * 5.60312 GeV.

Let me compute that: 2 *5.60312 = 11.20624; 0.5714 *5.60312 ≈ 3.20283. So total KE ≈ 11.20624 + 3.20283 = 14.409 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy of the RHIC. I'm trying to remember, in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV, which is their kinetic energy, not the total energy. So perhaps in this case, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy.

Wait, but sometimes the total energy is considered when it's a heavy ion collider. Let me think. The RHIC website says that it can collide heavy ions at up to 100 GeV per nucleus. Wait, but in the problem, the speed is 0.96c. For such a high speed, the kinetic energy is significant compared to the rest mass.

Wait, but let's compute both possibilities. The options are: A)18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419 GeV.

From earlier, I calculated the total energy (gamma m c²) as approximately 20.012 GeV, and the kinetic energy as about 14.409 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14.4. Option A is 18.475, which is about 3.34 times the rest mass. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the question is about total or kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. Because in that case, 20.012 GeV is close to option C (20.132 GeV). But my calculation was approximate. Let me do more precise calculations.

Wait, let me redo gamma with more precision. v is 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but 0.0784 is 196/2500? Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So using exact gamma value, let's compute E (total energy) and KE.

m c² is 5.60312 GeV.

E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.60312 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.60312.

First, 3 *5.60312 = 16.80936.

Then, 0.57142857 *5.60312.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7. Let me compute 4/7 *5.60312.

5.60312 *4 = 22.41248.

22.41248 /7 ≈ 3.20178286.

So adding to the 16.80936, E_total ≈ 16.80936 + 3.20178286 ≈ 20.01114 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV, which rounds to about 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, I used the mass of Li-6 as 6.015166 u. Let me double-check that. Li-6's atomic weight is about 6.015166 u for the atom. But the nucleus would have a slightly different mass. Wait, no: the atomic weight includes the electrons as well. For a neutral atom, it's protons + neutrons + electrons. So perhaps I should subtract the electrons' mass.

Wait, Li has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons contribute 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.0016457 u.

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be 6.015166 u (the atom) minus 0.0016457 u (the three electrons) = 6.0135203 u.

So m = 6.0135203 u.

So m c² is 6.0135203 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.
0.0135203 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.0035203 *931.5≈3.27. Total ≈ 9.315 +3.27=12.585.

So total m c² =5589 +12.585 = 5601.585 MeV =5.601585 GeV.

Wait, earlier I had 5.60312 GeV. So perhaps more accurately, m c² is approximately 5.601585 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.601585 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601585.

I'll break it down:

3 *5.601585 =16.804755

0.57142857 *5.601585.

Compute 0.5 *5.601585 =2.8007925

0.07142857 *5.601585 ≈ 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285; 0.07142857 *0.601585≈0.04300. So total ≈0.35714285 +0.04300 ≈0.40014285.

So 0.57142857 *5.601585 ≈2.8007925 +0.40014285 ≈3.20093535.

So overall E_total =16.804755 +3.20093535 ≈20.00569 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.0057 GeV. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So the closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation is 20.0057, which is about 20.006 GeV. So why is option C 20.132? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of the Li-6 isotope, including the electrons, and then compute the rest energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma with more precision. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not asking for the total energy but the kinetic energy. Let's compute the kinetic energy.

KE= (gamma -1)*m c².

gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1=2.57142857.

So KE=2.57142857 *5.601585 GeV.

Compute this:

2.5 *5.601585=14.0039625.

0.07142857 *5.601585 ≈0.40093.

So KE≈14.0039625 +0.40093≈14.4049 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14.4 GeV.

Wait, but the options are all above 18 GeV except for option A, which is 18.475. So that's higher than my previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, not the atomic mass. Because the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus is just protons and neutrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015166 u, which is for the atom, including 3 electrons. So the nucleus mass is 6.015166 u minus 3*(mass of an electron).

Wait, the mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.0016457 u.

So nucleus mass =6.015166 -0.0016457=6.0135203 u.

So m=6.0135203 u.

m c² =6.0135203 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0135203 *931.5 MeV.

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.0035203 *931.5=approx 3.273 MeV.

So total for the 0.0135203 is 9.315 +3.273=12.588 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +12.588 =5601.588 MeV =5.601588 GeV.

So same as before. So E_total is 3.57142857 *5.601588.

That's 3.57142857 *5.601588.

Wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601588.

Let me do it step by step.

3 *5.601588 =16.804764.

0.57142857 *5.601588.

0.5 *5.601588 =2.800794.

0.07142857 *5.601588.

0.07 *5.601588=0.392111.

0.00142857 *5.601588≈0.008000.

So 0.392111 +0.008=0.400111.

So total for 0.57142857 is 2.800794 +0.400111=3.200905.

So E_total=16.804764 +3.200905=20.005669 GeV.

So approximately 20.0057 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, a bit higher. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation of the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Let me check exact mass of Li-6. The exact mass is 6.013530 u.

Wait, let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. According to tables, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015166 u. So the nucleus would be 6.015166 u - 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass:6.015166 -0.00164574 =6.01352026 u.

So m=6.01352026 u.

m c²=6.01352026 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01352026 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01352026 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00352026 *931.5=3.2735 approximately.

So 9.315 +3.2735=12.5885 MeV.

Total m c²=5589 +12.5885=5601.5885 MeV=5.6015885 GeV.

Now, gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So E_total=3.57142857 *5.6015885.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6015885.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6015885.

3 *5.6015885 =16.8047655.

0.57142857 *5.6015885.

Compute 0.5 *5.6015885=2.80079425.

0.07142857 *5.6015885.

0.07 *5.6015885=0.392111195.

0.00142857 *5.6015885= approx 0.0080000008.

So total for 0.07142857 is approx 0.392111195 +0.0080000008=0.4001112.

So 0.57142857 *5.6015885=2.80079425 +0.4001112=3.20090545.

So E_total=16.8047655 +3.20090545=20.00567095 GeV.

So about 20.0057 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.126 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²= (0.96)^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it using exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which is E=gamma m c^2, but the options are rounded to 4 decimal places.

Wait, 20.0057 is approximately 20.0057 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. That's a discrepancy of about 0.126 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check another source for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, according to the periodic table, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the mixture of isotopes. However, for Li-6, the exact mass is 6.013530 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me compute m c² precisely.

m =6.013530 u.

m c²=6.013530 *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.013530 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.003530 *931.5.

0.003 *931.5=2.7945.

0.000530 *931.5=0.496095.

So 2.7945 +0.496095=3.290595.

So 0.013530 *931.5=9.315 +3.290595=12.605595 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +12.605595=5601.605595 MeV=5.601605595 GeV.

Now, E_total=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.601605595.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.601605595.

3 *5.601605595=16.804816785.

0.57142857 *5.601605595.

0.5 *5.601605595=2.8008027975.

0.07142857 *5.601605595.

0.07 *5.601605595=0.39211239165.

0.00142857 *5.601605595≈0.0080000008.

So 0.39211239165 +0.0080000008=0.40011239245.

So 0.57142857 *5.601605595=2.8008027975 +0.40011239245=3.20091519 GeV.

So E_total=16.804816785 +3.20091519=20.005731975 GeV.

So approximately 20.0057 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm. Maybe the question is considering the kinetic energy, but that's about 14.4 GeV, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the speed and wants the total energy, but including the kinetic energy, which is E=gamma m c². But perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a proton plus neutron times 6, which would be different. Let me compute that.

Mass of a proton ≈1.007276 u.

Mass of a neutron≈1.008665 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m =3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

Wait, but the actual mass is about 6.013530 u, which is less than 6.047823. So that's due to binding energy. So using the individual nucleon masses isn't correct. So probably, the correct mass is 6.013530 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

v^2= (0.96 c)^2=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately using a calculator.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, since 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714...

Wait, but perhaps we can compute it as a fraction.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(196/2500) )=1/(14/50) )=50/14=25/7≈3.5714285714.

So 25/7 is about 3.5714285714.

So, let me compute E_total= (25/7) * m c².

With m c²=5.6016056 GeV.

So 25/7 *5.6016056.

25 *5.6016056=140.04014 GeV.

Divide by 7: 140.04014 /7 =20.0057342857 GeV.

So E_total≈20.0057 GeV.

Again, this brings me back to approximately 20.0057 GeV, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Let me compute that.

Kinetic energy KE = E_total - m c² =20.0057 -5.6016056=14.4041 GeV.

But the options are all higher than that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the energy in the problem refers to the total energy, and the options are more precise. Let me compute with more decimal places.

m c²=5.6015885 GeV.

gamma=25/7=3.5714285714.

So E_total= (25/7)*5.6015885.

Compute 5.6015885 *25 =140.0397125.

Divide by 7: 140.0397125 /7 =20.005673214 GeV.

So about 20.00567 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy but I'm getting 14.4 GeV. None of the options match that. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy. So why is option C 20.132 GeV, which is higher than my calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check another source for the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013530 u.

Which gives m c²=6.013530 *931.5 MeV/u =5.601585 GeV.

So back to E_total=20.00567 GeV.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the speed of the nucleus to be 0.96c, but perhaps the energy is in the center-of-mass frame, which would be different.

Wait, no, the problem states that "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So it's the speed of the nucleus in the lab frame, perhaps. So the energy would be the relativistic energy of a single nucleus moving at 0.96c.

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps using the relation between kinetic energy and speed.

The kinetic energy K is given by:

K = (gamma - 1) m c².

We can express gamma in terms of v:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, K = (1/sqrt(1-v²/c²) -1) m c².

But perhaps another way is to express K in terms of v. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express K as (v²/(2(1 - v²/c²)) ) * m c².

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total energy and then see which option is closest.

My calculation gives E_total≈20.0057 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.126 GeV higher.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the rest mass energy as 5.6 GeV, but perhaps it's considering the sum of protons and neutrons without subtracting binding energy. That would give a higher rest mass, which would make the total energy higher.

Earlier when I calculated the mass as 3 protons +3 neutrons, without considering binding energy, I got m=3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665)= 3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

Which gives m c²=6.047823 *931.5 MeV/u =6.047823 *0.9315 GeV ≈5.631 GeV.

Then, E_total=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.631 GeV.

Compute that: 3.57142857 *5.631.

3 *5.631=16.893.

0.57142857 *5.631.

0.5 *5.631=2.8155.

0.07142857 *5.631≈0.403.

Total for 0.57142857: 2.8155 +0.403=3.2185.

E_total=16.893 +3.2185=20.1115 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1115 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps the question is using the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without considering binding energy), which would give a higher m c² and thus a higher total energy.

So the discrepancy arises because in reality, the nucleus has a lower mass due to binding energy, but perhaps the problem ignores that and assumes each nucleon contributes exactly 1 u.

So, if the problem treats the mass as 6 u (since Li-6 has mass number 6), then m c²=6 *931.5 MeV=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then E_total=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3.5 *5.589=19.5615.

0.07142857 *5.589≈0.400.

So E_total≈19.5615 +0.400=19.9615 GeV.

Which is closer to 20 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, but when I used the sum of individual nucleons, I got m c²=5.631 GeV, leading to E_total≈20.11 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the exact mass of Li-6, which is 6.013530 u, leading to E_total≈20.0057 GeV, but none of the options match exactly.

Looking back at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when I used the exact mass, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Let me recompute E_total with m=6.013530 u.

m c²=6.013530 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6*931.5=5589.

0.013530 *931.5=12.605595 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +12.605595=5601.605595 MeV=5.601605595 GeV.

gamma=25/7≈3.5714285714.

E_total=25/7 *5.601605595= (25 *5.601605595)/7.

25 *5.601605595=140.04014.

140.04014/7=20.00573428 GeV.

So approximately 20.0057 GeV.

None of the options are exactly this; the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but it's 0.1263 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the actual speed is 0.96c, so gamma is slightly different. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/ sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857...

But perhaps I should compute it using more precise values.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, since 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So no mistake there.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm getting around 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial assumption. Maybe the energy is the total energy, but the options are considering the sum of the individual particles' rest masses, leading to a higher E_total.

But then, in that case, using m=6 u, E_total=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV≈20.11 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives 20.132 GeV. Let me compute E_total using more precise m.

m=6.013530 u.

m c²=6.013530 *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.013530 *931.5.

=6 *931.5 +0.013530 *931.5.

=5589 + (0.01 *931.5 +0.003530 *931.5)

=5589 + (9.315 +3.274395)

=5589 +12.589395=5601.589395 MeV=5.601589395 GeV.

gamma=25/7=3.5714285714.

So E_total=3.5714285714 *5.601589395.

Compute 3 *5.601589395=16.804768185.

0.5714285714 *5.601589395.

0.5 *5.601589395=2.8007946975.

0.0714285714 *5.601589395.

Let me compute 0.0714285714 *5.601589395.

0.07 *5.601589395=0.39211125765.

0.0014285714 *5.601589395≈0.0080000008.

So 0.39211125765 +0.008=0.40011125765.

So 0.5714285714 *5.601589395=2.8007946975 +0.40011125765=3.200905955 GeV.

So E_total=16.804768185 +3.200905955=20.00567414 GeV.

So approximately 20.005674 GeV.

Given that, none of the options exactly match, but the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass, but I've checked that multiple times.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, but that gives 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy per nucleon. No, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction differently. Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the gamma calculation is being done with more precise decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the exact gamma as 3.5714285714285714.

Let me compute E_total again with m=5.601589395 GeV.

E_total=3.5714285714285714 *5.601589395.

Let me compute this using precise multiplication.

3.5714285714285714 *5.601589395.

I'll break it down:

3.5714285714285714 *5 =17.857142857142857.

3.5714285714285714 *0.6=2.1428571428571425.

3.5714285714285714 *0.001589395≈0.005703.

So adding up:

17.857142857142857 +2.1428571428571425=20.0.

Plus 0.005703=20.005703 GeV.

So, about 20.0057 GeV.

Which again is close to 20.0057 GeV, not matching any option exactly.

Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculation when using the sum of individual nucleon masses. But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the total energy as (gamma * m c²) where m is the mass of the nucleus, which I have as approximately 5.601589 GeV, leading to E_total≈20.0057 GeV. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression. Let me compute E using the exact values.

E = gamma * m c².

gamma=25/7.

m=6.013530 u.

m c²=6.013530 *931.5 MeV/u =5.601585 GeV.

So E= (25/7) *5.601585.

25/7 is approximately 3.5714285714.

25/7 *5.601585 = (25 *5.601585)/7.

25 *5.601585=140.039625.

140.039625 /7=20.005660714 GeV.

So approximately 20.00566 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, 20.0057 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.126 GeV higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction with more precise decimals, leading to a slightly different gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

Let me compute 1 -v²/c²=1- (0.96)^2=1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

No, that's exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest energy as 5.6 GeV, leading to E_total=3.57142857 *5.6=20.0 GeV.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma m c², but with m as the total rest mass of the individual nucleons, not the nucleus. So m=6 u.

In that case, m c²=6*931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E_total=3.57142857 *5.589=20.11 GeV.

Which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps that's what the problem is expecting. So the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \( 6.013530 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.013530 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5601.605595 \, \text{MeV} = 5.601605595 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m c^2 = 5.601605595 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.601605595
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 5.601605595 = 16.804816785
\]
\[
0.57142857 \times 5.601605595 = 3.200905955
\]
\[
E = 16.804816785 + 3.200905955 = 20.00572274 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0057 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C
