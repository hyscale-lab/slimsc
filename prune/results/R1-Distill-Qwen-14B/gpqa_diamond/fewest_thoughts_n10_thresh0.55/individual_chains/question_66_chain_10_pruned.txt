Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that preserve certain symmetries of the Standard Model.

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options for the answer are combinations of these.

First, I need to think about each symmetry and whether it's required for the operators in SMEFT.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. Effective theories generally preserve the same symmetries as the underlying theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. That makes sense because you can't have terms that break Lorentz invariance without introducing new physics at a certain scale. So answer 1 is correct.

Next is Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, it must include both. But wait, the SMEFT doesn't necessarily require Poincare symmetry? Or does it? Because the Standard Model does have Poincare symmetry, so the effective theory should as well. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare invariant. So option 2 is correct. So that means the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but wait. In
