Okay, so I've got this question here about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. 

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity might affect transit probability, but maybe not here.

Wait, but they also mention the host stars. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same radius, so maybe they’re similar in size despite the mass difference.

I think the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the distance at which the planet's size would just block the star's light. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor involving the orbital distance.

Wait, no, let me think again. The transit probability
