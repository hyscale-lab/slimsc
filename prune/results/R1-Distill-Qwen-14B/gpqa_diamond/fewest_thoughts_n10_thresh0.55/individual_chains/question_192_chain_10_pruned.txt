Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, but s must be less than R because the cavity is inside, right? Because if s was equal to R, the cavity's center would be at the edge, but since r < R, I think s is the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

So, the problem says a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are bigger than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think about how charges distribute in such a setup. Oh, right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. The charge +q in the cavity would cause an induced charge -q on the inner surface
