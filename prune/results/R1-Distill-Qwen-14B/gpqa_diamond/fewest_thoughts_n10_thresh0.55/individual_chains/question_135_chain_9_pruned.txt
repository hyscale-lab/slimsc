Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, not sure I get that notation correctly. Oh, right, usually the Lagrangian terms involve the coupling between the boson and fermions. So the X field must be interacting with the fermions, which means it could decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So we’re looking for all possible pairs of fermions where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV, I guess. Because in particle physics, a boson can decay into a pair of particles if their combined mass is less than the boson's mass.

Wait, but also, it can't exceed the mass. So for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, no, for a pair, it's twice the mass since you have a particle and an antiparticle. So for a fermion f, the mass of the boson must be at least 2m_f.

So first, let me list the masses of all the known fermions. Let me see:

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): around 0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): around 0.004 GeV
Down quark (d): about 0.005 GeV
Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
Strange (s): around 0.009 GeV (wait, no, I think that's wrong. Wait, I might be mixing up up and down. Let me correct that. No, actually, the masses are: u and d are light, around 2-5 MeV each. Then s is about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV), c is about 1.3 GeV, bottom (b) is about 4.5 Ge
