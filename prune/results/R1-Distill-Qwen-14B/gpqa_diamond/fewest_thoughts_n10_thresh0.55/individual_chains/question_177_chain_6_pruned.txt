Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosities, right? So mass isn't directly the key here, unless it relates to something like temperature.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but how does that relate to luminosity? Luminosity for a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But since T for both stars is the same, T1 = T2 = T. So the luminosity ratio would be (R1² T^4) / (R2² T^4) ) = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play?

Wait a minute, radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh! Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light is Doppler shifted. So if Star_2 is moving away (positive velocity) or towards, the observed wavelength changes.

But wait, in the problem, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Does that mean the observed λ_max is
