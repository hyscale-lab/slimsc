Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+, I guess. So the question is about the fraction of Co that's in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Stability constants, β, are the formation constants. Each β represents how stable a particular complex is. For each complex, βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), I think. Because each SCN is -1 charge, so for n SCN, the charge would be 2+ - n*(-1) = 2-n? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would form [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ - n*(-1)}? No, wait, each SCN is -1, so n SCN contributes -n. So the complex charge would be 2+ + (-n) = 2 - n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm, but I think in practice, the actual charge might not be as important as the order of β.

Wait, the problem mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. I remember that in crystal field theory, different ligands cause different colors. But I'm not sure about the exact complexes. But the question is about the percentage, so probably we'll use the stability constants to calculate the distribution.

The main idea is that the Co^2+ can form various complexes with SCN^-: [Co(SCN)]^+,
