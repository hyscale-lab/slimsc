Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. When X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius, maybe? Not exactly sure, but I remember that melting points can hint at certain substances.

Let me break this down. First, I'll try to figure out what each of these substances could be.

Gas W: Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the number of protons equals neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Hydrogen has one proton, one neutron in deuterium but wait, deuterium is an isotope, but as a gas, maybe H2? But H2 has one proton each, so total 2. Neutrons: each H has 0, so total 0. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe another element. Let's see, let's think of a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.

Wait, another thought: The molecule's atoms have equal protons and neutrons. Hmm, perhaps carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But, wait, carbon dioxide is a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's carbon monoxide? No, but let's get back to that.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2. Let's see. Carbon has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (for 12C), oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (16O). So each CO2 molecule has 1 C and 2 O. The total protons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 6+16=22. The neutrons: 6 (for C) + 2*(8) (for O) = 6+16=22. Oh! So protons and neutrons in the molecule are both 22. That fits the description. So gas W
