Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star that has some characteristics. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm, okay. So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Here, n2 and n1 are the number of particles in levels 2 and 1, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. The spots are cooler regions, I think, so the surrounding photosphere must be emitting less overall. But how does that affect the temperature in the photosphere where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, the question says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature has dropped. So the measurement of the ratio would be based on this lower temperature.

The ratio of n1 to n2 (since the question mentions the ratio of level 1 to level 2) would change with temperature. Because when the temperature is lower, the exponential term in the Boltzmann factor becomes smaller. That would make n2/n1 smaller, so n1/n2 would be larger. But wait, the question says that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I just thought. Wait, maybe I'm getting the ratio backwards.

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. So that's n1/n2. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K, so with higher T, the ratio n1/n2 would be lower because more atoms would be in the higher energy level (since higher T favors higher energy states). So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 would increase. But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, that's contradictory. Did I get the ratio direction wrong?

Wait, let me clarify. The
