Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, given the information provided. Let me read through the question again carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. They've already detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. 

The stars are interesting too. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. However, both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. 

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Specifically, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more aligned with our line of sight, which is a function of the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, noâ€”more accurately, the probability (p) of a transit is given by the formula p = (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, actually, I think the correct formula is p = (R_p / a) * (something about the star's radius?), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, actually, the transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because if the planet's orbit is edge-on, the probability is (R_s)/(a), but since the planet's size is much smaller than the star, R_p << R_s, so it's roughly (R_s)/(a). But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. So the probability is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller and the star is larger.

But in this problem, both host stars have the same radius (R_s same for both). So the probability depends on the semi-major axis of the planet's
