Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f ψ_f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, so first, the Lagrangian term. Hmm, the interaction term here looks like it's describing the coupling between the boson X and some fermions. The term is -λ_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Oh wait, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. The term is probably something like λψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, but with some signs and factors. But more importantly, this suggests that X is interacting with fermions, right?

So boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. Because bosons can decay into fermions if the interaction allows it. So the question is about what fermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Now, kinematically allowed means that the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions in the pair. So for each possible fermion pair, their combined mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.
