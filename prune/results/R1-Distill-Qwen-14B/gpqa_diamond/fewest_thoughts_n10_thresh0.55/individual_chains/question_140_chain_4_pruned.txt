Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the clues.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has heavier isotopes in one of its elements. 

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. The fact that it reacts violently with a liquid and releases a gas suggests some kind of acid-base reaction. Maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid, like magnesium with hydrochloric acid, which would produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but the gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So that can't be it because 1â‰ 0. Or maybe it's another gas.

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about other gases. Helium is a noble gas, but its molecule is monoatomic. Each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since He-4 is the common isotope). So He has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. That fits the condition. So W could be helium? Or maybe another gas.

Or maybe it's CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons (C:6, O:8 each, so 6+16*2=44 protons) but neutrons would be different. Wait, but the molecule as a whole? Wait, maybe the molecule's total protons and neutrons are equal. Wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, no, each molecule. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, so for a molecule, the sum of protons in all the atoms equals the sum of neutrons in all the atoms. Hmm. Let me
