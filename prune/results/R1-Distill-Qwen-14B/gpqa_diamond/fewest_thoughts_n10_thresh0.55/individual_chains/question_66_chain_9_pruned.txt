Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The question gives four options about symmetries, and I need to choose which combination is correct. I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way. 

Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, so any effective theory built upon it should also maintain that symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a yes.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare adds momentum translations. Are operators in SMEFT required to have Poincare symmetry? Well, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's formulated in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant. Therefore, SMEFT operators should also respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2, Poincare, would be important. Wait, but waitâ€”I've heard that some effective theories are built in a way that assumes Poincare invariance, but sometimes when you write operators, perhaps they don't all individually respect Poincare? Or maybe the SMEFT framework ensures that all operators do respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe SMEFT operators are organized in such a way that they form Poin
