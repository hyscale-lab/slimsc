Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the Doppler shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star. 

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the only variables here are the Doppler shifts they cause. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes 7 milliangstrom. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit. The RV method measures the star's velocity toward and away from us, right? So the bigger the velocity, the larger the shift. 

The formula I remember is that the RV velocity (v) is related to the mass of the planet (M_planet), the mass of the star (M_star), and the orbital period (P). Oh, but wait, since both stars are the same mass, that simplifies things. Also, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are the same. So the RV velocity should be directly related to the orbital period somehow.

Wait, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given by K = (v) = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is K = ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(3/2))) )) But in this case, since the planets are Neptune-sized and the stars are solar mass, M_planet << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so those terms simplify.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M
