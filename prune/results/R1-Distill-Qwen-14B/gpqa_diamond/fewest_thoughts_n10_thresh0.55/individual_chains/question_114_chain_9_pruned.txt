Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second part involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that reactions involving ketones and nitriles... Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or addition? But butan-2-one is acetone, right? It's (CH3)2CO. So when acetone reacts with something like NaCN, what happens?

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. For ketones, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones are not typically very reactive towards nucleophilic addition unless under certain conditions. Oh, I think I remember that in the presence of acid, a ketone can undergo nucleophilic addition. Because the acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (acetone) is treated with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one
