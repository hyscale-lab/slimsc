Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right. Let me break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, but wait—when it comes to relative speeds, especially at relativistic velocities, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula applies here. But wait, is that even the right approach for relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction?

Wait, no. Let me think. The velocities are given in the same reference frame, say the Earth's frame. If I want the relative speed of one astronaut as seen by the other, I should use the velocity addition formula. Because each astronaut is in their own inertial frame.

So the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), where v1 and v2 are the velocities in the same direction. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because when you change frames, you can
