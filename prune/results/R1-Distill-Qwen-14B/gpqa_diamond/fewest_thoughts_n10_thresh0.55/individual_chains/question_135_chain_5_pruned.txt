Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this physics question about the decay of a boson. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangian notation, but I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. So the boson X is interacting with some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay is possible based on conservation laws and the mass of the boson. So I should look at each possible decay product and see if their combined mass is less than or equal to the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible fermions depend on their mass. Let's think about the masses of all the known fermions.

Quarks: Let's list their masses (approximate, in GeV/c²).
- Up and down: around 2-5 MeV (so very light, negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Strange: about 100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: way too heavy, ~173 GeV
Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Others like neutrinos are even lighter, but I don't think they are considered here because the interaction is with ψf, which I assume are quarks.

Wait the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are fermion fields. So the fermions that X can decay into are those that are present in the Lagrangian. The term includes f and ψ_f, but looking at the term: it's written as -λ f f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. The
