Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I need to relate the excitation levels to the temperatures of the stars.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is involved here. The population ratio of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Oh right, because higher energy levels have fewer atoms in them when it's lower temperature.

In this case, the excited state is higher energy, so E2 is higher than E1. For star_1, let's say the ratio is n2/n1 = 2, because the excitation is twice as much. For star_2, that ratio would be 1, right? Or wait, no. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that level compared to star_2. So, if I take the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1? Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait no, maybe for star_2, the excitation is lower. So, the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1, but wait that's not possible because if the same energy difference, different temperatures would affect the ratio. Let's think more carefully.

Let me denote for Star 1: (n2_1/n1_1) = 2. For Star 2: (n2_2/n1_2) = 1. Or maybe the ratio is different. Wait no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, if the ground state is E1, and excited state is E2, then (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's (n
