Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The system has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case, so that can't be it. Relativistic effects must change things.

In relativity, as the speed approaches the speed of light c, the mass increases due to gamma (Lorentz factor), gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equations of motion would change because the mass effectively becomes gamma*m, not just m. So the simple classical formula won't hold here.

Let me think about the energy. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². All of that is converted into kinetic energy at maximum speed. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The correct relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting the total energy equal to the kinetic energy at maximum speed: 

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. In the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't (1/2)kx² anymore. Or is it? Oh, wait, no. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx² regardless of the frame, because it's a conservative force. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA². So when the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy converts into kinetic energy. But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

So:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Hmm, solving for gamma. Let me write that equation:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Let me rearrange for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as something, like a variable. Let me call it alpha for now. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + alpha)^2 ).

So,

v²/c² =
