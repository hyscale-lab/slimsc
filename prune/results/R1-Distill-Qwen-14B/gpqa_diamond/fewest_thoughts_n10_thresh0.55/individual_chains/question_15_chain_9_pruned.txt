Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting from the given options. Let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which is good because that might make calculations easier.

The host stars are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that doesn't affect the radius here since they're the same.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability to maximize their chances.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula I think is something like P = (R_star / a) * (1 + sin i), but wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Oh right, the probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula P = (R*/a) * (1 + (R_p / R*)) where R_p is the planet radius. But wait, in this case, I don't think we have the planet radii. Oh, but the question says the planets are Earth-like, so maybe we can assume their radii are similar? Or perhaps it's not needed because it's the same for both planets.

Wait, no, the planets have the same mass, but radius isn't necessarily the same. But since they are Earth-like, maybe they have similar radii. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Wait, but the formula for transit probability is actually P = (R*/a) multiplied by (something else?), but I think the main factor is R*/a, because that's the ratio that determines whether the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star.

Wait, no, the actual formula for the probability
