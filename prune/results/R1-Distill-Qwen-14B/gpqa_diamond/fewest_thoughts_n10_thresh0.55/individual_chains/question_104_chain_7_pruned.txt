Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, okay, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the Doppler shift, right?

The question says we have two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected the first planet with a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and the second was 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, orbital period... I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, and from that, we can get the mass function. The mass function involves the velocity semi-amplitude (K), the orbital period (P), and the inclination angle. But since both planets are detected, the inclination probably isn't zero, but I think we can assume a face-on orbit for simplicity, which makes the mass function equal to the actual mass. But wait, no, the mass function is (M^3 sin^3 i)/( (M_star + M)^2 ), but because M_planet is much smaller than M_star, it's approximated as M_p sin i. But since both planets are detected, perhaps i is the same or not? Hmm, maybe the exact inclination isn't known, but since both are detected, perhaps the same method applies.

Wait, but the question says the same method detected the planets, so maybe the RV shifts are what's given. So the RV shift (velocity semi-amplitude) K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

I think the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v * (M_p / M_s)) ) / sin i, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV method relies on the Doppler shift, which is proportional to the star's velocity. The star's velocity due to the planet is given by K = (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3
