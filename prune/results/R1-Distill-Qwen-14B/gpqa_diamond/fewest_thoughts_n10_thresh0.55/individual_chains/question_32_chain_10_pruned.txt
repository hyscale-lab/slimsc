Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think this through.

So the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? Li typically has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. But wait, in the context of colliders, are they considering the ion as a charged particle or just as a nucleus? I think for energy calculations, we might treat it as a particle with a certain rest mass.

So first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I should double-check that. Each proton is about 1.007 u, and each neutron is about 1.0087 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons = 3 * 1.007 ≈ 3.021 u, and 3 neutrons = 3 * 1.0087 ≈ 3.0261 u. Adding them gives 3.021 + 3.0261 = 6.0471 u. So the mass is approximately 6.0471 u. But wait, sometimes the exact mass might be a bit different, but I think for this problem, using the mass number as 6 u is a common approximation, but maybe I should look up the exact value. Oh, but wait, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0471 u as I calculated.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I can convert the rest mass into energy. The rest mass energy (m0c²) is m0 * 931.5 MeV. So m0 for Li-6 is 6.0471 u. Let me calculate that: 6.0471 * 931.5 ≈ let's see, 6 * 931.5
