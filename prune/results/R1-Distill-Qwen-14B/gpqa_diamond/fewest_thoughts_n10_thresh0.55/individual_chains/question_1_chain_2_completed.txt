Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 is what we're looking for. To clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, it would be hard to tell the two apart.

So the total energy uncertainty would be the maximum of the two, right? Because if either state's uncertainty is larger than the energy difference, you can't resolve them. Or wait, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Or maybe not. Because the two states are separate, so the uncertainty in their energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps each state's energy uncertainty contributes to the overall uncertainty in the difference.

Wait, let's think. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2. When you consider the difference E2 - E1, the uncertainty is approximately ΔE (since they're independent). So the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, you can't resolve it.

Wait, no. Because the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties in each energy, right? Because Δ(E2 - E1) = ΔE2 + ΔE1. So the total uncertainty is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In that case, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than ΔE_total. So the minimum energy difference is just above ΔE_total.

Let me calculate ΔE_total. For E1, ΔE1 ≈6.56e-7 eV, and for E2, ΔE2≈6.56e-8 eV. So adding them gives 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV. So about 7.2e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are all much smaller or in different ranges. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) 1e-9 eV
B) 1e-11 eV
C) 1e-4 eV
D) 1e-8 eV

Hmm, none of the options are above 1e-4 eV. Wait, wait: 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 10^-4 eV. That's much larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the uncertainty, that would mean the two states can be resolved.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the uncertainty in E1 is about 6.5e-7 eV and in E2 about 6.5e-8 eV. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately 7.15e-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference (ΔE) between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.15e-7 eV to be resolved.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. Which is way larger than 7.15e-7 eV, so that would be resolvable.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The question says the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 s. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, for E1: τ1 =1e-9 s. So ΔE1= ħ/(τ1) = (1.05e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. To eV: 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 6.56e-7 eV.

E2: τ2=1e-8 s. ΔE2=1.05e-34/(1e-8)=1.05e-26 J. 1.05e-26 /1.6e-19 = 6.56e-8 eV.

So ΔE_total is 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.

So the required energy difference must be greater than 7.2e-7 eV. Among the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That is much larger than 7.2e-7, so it's resolvable.

Other options: A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV. So it's not resolvable. B is 1e-11, even smaller. D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8, which is less than 7e-7 eV. So no, that's not enough. Only C is larger.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. Here, the lifetimes of the states (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)) serve as the time uncertainties (\( \Delta t \)).

The uncertainty in energy for each state is calculated as:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting these to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is approximately:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Among the given options:
- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), insufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that allows clear resolution of the two states is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
