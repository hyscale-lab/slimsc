Okay, so I've got this question about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks for the mean decay distance of the meson X. I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh, right, tau is the mean proper lifetime, which is related to the width of the resonance. The width Gamma is the total decay width, and it's connected to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, the units here are important. Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ (hbar) is usually in units of MeV·s when dealing with particle physics. Let me think about the constants. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but wait, wait, no. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so I need to convert units properly.

Wait, let me double-check. Planck's constant h is 6.626×10^-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.05457
