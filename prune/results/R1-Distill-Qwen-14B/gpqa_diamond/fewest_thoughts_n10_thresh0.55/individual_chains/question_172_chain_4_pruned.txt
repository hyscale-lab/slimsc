Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think. So, the question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use some basic thermal physics here.

Wait, what do I remember about excitation in stars? Oh right, Boltzmann distribution. The distribution of particles in different energy levels depends on temperature. The higher the temperature, the more the higher energy states are populated. So, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But wait, I think E_i is the higher energy level than E_j. So if the energy difference is delta E = E_i - E_j, then the ratio is exp(-delta E/(k T)).

In this question, the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, the population ratio (n1/n2) is 2. But wait, wait, no. Because the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited." So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, their populations are n1 and n2. So n1 = 2 n2
