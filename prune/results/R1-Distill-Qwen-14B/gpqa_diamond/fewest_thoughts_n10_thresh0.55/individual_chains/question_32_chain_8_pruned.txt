Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a certain nucleus. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I need to identify what nucleus X is. The problem states it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, wait, Li usually refers to Lithium. The standard Lithium-7 isotope has 3 neutrons because it has 3 protons (since atomic number Z is 3 for Li) plus 3 neutrons, making it 7. But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The atomic number for Lithium is 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6. Because Li-6 is a common isotope. Alternatively, maybe it's Li-7 if it's 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but the problem says 3 neutrons. So yes, X is Li-6. The mass number A is 3+3=6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because Li has Z=3, so if it's Li with 3
