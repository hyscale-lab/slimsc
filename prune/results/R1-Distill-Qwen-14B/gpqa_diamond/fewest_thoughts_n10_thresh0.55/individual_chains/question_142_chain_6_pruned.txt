Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix, ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position. The options are points in 3D space with coordinates (r_x, r_y, r_z). Wait, what's the geometrical position referring to here? Oh right, I think the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

But how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ. Expanding it: ρ = (1/2)|0><0| + (1/2)|1><1|. Wait, |0><0| is the outer product, which would have 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly for |1><1|. So when I add them, I get a diagonal matrix with (1,1) entries. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with [1/2, 1/2] along the diagonal.

But in the form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, let me compute each term. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 would be [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

Now, the given ρ is diagonal with entries (1/2, 1/2). That means the off-diagonal terms must be zero. So comparing the two expressions, the off-diagonal elements (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 must be zero. Let me set them to zero.

So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if r_x is not zero, then the real part would be non-zero, but the whole term is zero. Similarly, the imaginary part must also be zero. So r_x and r_y are both zero.

Now, the diagonal terms of ρ are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Since the given ρ has both diagonal terms as 1/2, set (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. Solving that, 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Putting it all together, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That would mean the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but wait. The density matrix ρ I have is a completely mixed state. Because it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is a statistical mixture of the two basis states. In the Bloch sphere, a pure state is on the surface (like (0,0,1) for |0>), and a completely mixed state would be at the
