Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. I'll start by analyzing the spectral data given for compound X.

First, let's look at the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, 1450 cm-1. Well, the 3400-2500 region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since it's a broad region, maybe it's an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 could be C-O or maybe another aromatic ring vibration.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in DMSO, the acidic protons of carboxylic acids show up around 10-12 ppm and are usually broad singlets.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to 2H. This is likely aromatic protons. If it's a doublet, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. So, two equivalent protons adjacent to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, also 2H. If the first is at 8.0, this is lower, so perhaps the substituent is in the para position. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one electron-withdrawing (like a carbonyl) and another group?
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Could this be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone? Or perhaps a CH next to another group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for 2H. Maybe another set of methylene protons, perhaps adjacent to something else.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is next to another CH2 or something else.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain (like CH2CH3), so maybe a longer chain like ethyl or butyl.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest two substituents in the para positions. Let me think: the substituents could be an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and maybe an electron-donating group (like a methyl or ethyl). But wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl, which is more like a carboxylic acid (if there's an O-H) or an ester. But in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500-
