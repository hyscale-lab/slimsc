Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E, involving these variables and constants like 4πε₀.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then we place a charge inside the cavity, that should induce some charges on the cavity walls and the outer surface of the conductor.

Wait, right. When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged. So the inner surface would have a charge of -q, and since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So when you put a positive charge q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the charge on the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface must then be +q to balance, making the total conductor neutral again.

So the outer surface has +q on it. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so when calculating the electric field at P, I should treat the entire conductor as a shell with charge +q. Because the charge distribution on the outer surface is symmetric, the electric field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point
