Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals... I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the unit cell edges. So if it's a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a cube-like structure but with all edges equal and all angles equal. But wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance 'a' is the edge length of the cube. So for a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters are a, b, c which are all equal, and angles alpha, beta, gamma which are all 30 degrees here.

Wait, no, actually, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or is it part of the cubic system? I might be getting confused. Oh wait, no, the rhombohedral system is a subclass of the cubic system where all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal but not 90 degrees. So yeah, in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar
