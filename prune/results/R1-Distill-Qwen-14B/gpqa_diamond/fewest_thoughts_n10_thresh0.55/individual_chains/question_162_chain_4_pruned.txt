Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So, this looks like a two-dimensional metric because there are only dx² and dy² terms. So, maybe this is a 2D spacetime or maybe a surface embedded in some higher dimension. Oh, but the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. Right, pseudospheres are like the hyperbolic equivalents of spheres.

Wait, the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, so its metric should look similar to hyperbolic space, but in 2D. The metric given here has a denominator of (4 - x² - y²). Let me see, if I compare this to the standard metric for hyperbolic space, like in Poincaré coordinates. The standard Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space in 2D has the metric ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)) (dx² + dy²), right? Where R is the radius of curvature. Wait, for hyperbolic geometry, the curvature is negative and relates to the radius. So here, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me factor that. 4 is like (2)^2, so maybe R is 2 here. Because if R is 2
