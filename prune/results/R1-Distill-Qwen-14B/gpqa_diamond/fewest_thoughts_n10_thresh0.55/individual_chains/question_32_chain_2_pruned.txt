Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? Nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I think I need to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the concept of relativistic kinetic energy. But wait, do I use kinetic energy or total energy? Hmm, the question says 'energy of the RHIC', which I think refers to the total energy each ion has when it's accelerated.

So, the first thing I should do is find the rest mass of the nucleus X. Since X is Lithium with 3 neutrons, that's Li-6 maybe? Because Lithium usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make the isotope Li-6. Let me confirm that. Lithium has atomic number 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6. Yes, that makes sense.

The next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. I know that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/cÂ², and a neutron is about
