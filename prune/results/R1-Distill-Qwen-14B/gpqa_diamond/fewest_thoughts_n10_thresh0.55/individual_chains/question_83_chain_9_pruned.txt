Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution factor.

Wait, right, when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume(L). So moles = Molarity × Volume in liters.

Molarity is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Wait, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So for 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid solution. Let me think about the state of the solution after adding that.

At 25% titration, some of the ac
