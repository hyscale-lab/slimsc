Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then figuring out the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 - 1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. So another way: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is zero here. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2= (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Each ring or double bond is one, each triple bond is two, etc. So 5 DoU could be one ring and two double bonds, or maybe two rings and one double bond, or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm as triplet (1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's possibly an aldehyde group.

6.98 ppm as doublet (2H). Could be aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. Wait, but benzene rings usually show more complex splitting. Alternatively, it could be from a vinyl group, like in an enal or conjugated system.

6.51 ppm doublet (2H), also aromatic perhaps. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, each a doublet. That suggests maybe two different aromatic rings, each with two H in a doublet.

6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H). Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton. But wait, it's a singlet and 2H. So maybe it's a diol or maybe two pro
