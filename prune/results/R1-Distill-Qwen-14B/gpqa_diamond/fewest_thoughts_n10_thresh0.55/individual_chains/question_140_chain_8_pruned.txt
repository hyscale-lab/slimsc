Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to piece this together. I'll start by thinking about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y releases gas W. The molecule of W has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, what gas fits that? Well, let's think of common gases. Let's consider H2O (water vapor), but wait, its molecule has H and O. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (common isotope is O-16). So for H2O, each molecule has 2 H's (each with 1p, 0n) and one O (8p, 8n). The total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility: CO2? No, because it's a linear molecule. Wait, maybe it's NH3? No, that's a gas but not sure. Wait, what about CH4? No, that's a gas but again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas? But noble gases are monoatomic, so the number of protons and neutrons would be the same for the isotope. For example, Argon-40 has 18 protons and 22 neutrons—no, that's 18 and 22, not same. Wait, maybe it's a molecule like O2 or N2. For O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So in O2, each O has 8p and 8n. So the entire molecule has 16p and 16n. So 16 each. So yes, same number. So O2 would fit.

But wait, does the reaction produce O2? Let me think. Or maybe the gas is something else. Another possibility is H2, but H2 has 2p and 0n, so no. So O2 is a possibility. Another thought: maybe the gas is CO (carbon monoxide). But CO has C (6p, 6n) and O (8p, 8n). So each molecule has 14p and 14n? Wait, no—each CO molecule has one C and one O. So C has 6p, 6n (assuming C-12), O has 8p, 8n (O-16). So total protons: 6+8=14; neutrons: 6+8=14. So yes, same. So CO could be the gas W.

Wait, but if W is CO, what reaction produces CO? Alternatively, maybe it's another diatomic gas. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe NO? NO has one N (7p, 7n) and one O (8p, 8n). So protons: 7+8=15; neutrons: 7+8=15. So that's same. So NO is another possibility. But NO is a bit reactive, but possible.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O? Wait, H2O: 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total p: 2 +8=10; n: 8. Not equal. So that's out.

So, possible W candidates are O2, CO, NO, or maybe something else. Let's keep that in mind.

Next, the reaction forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let's think: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B has a melting point just above 0 degrees C. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, I think ammonium chloride's melting point is higher. Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, think about what precipitates form when certain reactions occur. If X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid? Wait, but X is a substance that reacts with liquid Y. Let's think about possible reactions.

Wait, the product when a keto acid reacts with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When it reacts with X
