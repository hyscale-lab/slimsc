Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, the ratio of these levels decreases. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So normally, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower.

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So when the star is without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

But I need to find that factor. To find that, I need to find the ratio of the two ratios. Let me think about how the temperature affects this.

The energy difference between the two levels is given by the transition wavelength. The wavelength is approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE can be found using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light.

Calculating ΔE: Let me recall the values. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34
