Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let's start by reading through everything carefully.

The compound's molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds. Or maybe two rings and a double bond, but more likely a benzene ring, which accounts for 4 degrees (since benzene is three double bonds and a ring), and then another double bond or ring. So maybe a benzene ring and an enal or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). A triplet at high ppm (close to 10) could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but they're usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. Wait, but here it's a triplet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from a phenol. But in phenols, the protons are usually broad around
