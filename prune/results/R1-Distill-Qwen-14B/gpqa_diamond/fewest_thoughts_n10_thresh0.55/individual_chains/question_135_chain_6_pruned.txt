Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. The question gives a Lagrangian term that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, I remember that the Lagrangian tells us which interactions are possible. The term given is L = -λf ψ_f bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, wait, maybe the actual interaction term is λ times some product of fields. But the exact form might not matter as much as the particles involved. So, the fermions ψ_f are interacting with the boson X. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

But wait, the mass of the boson is important here. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Otherwise, kinematically it's impossible.

So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. So, particles like quarks, leptons, etc. Let's list the possible fermion pairs. Fermions include quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (like electrons, muons, taus, and their
