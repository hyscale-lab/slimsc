Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, understanding the initial reactions.

1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. Heating with KOH would likely be a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But since it's KOH in excess and under heat, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, 1,3-dibromo... wait, no, the structure is such that adjacent carbons have Br atoms. So elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I think. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because KOH is a base, maybe it's elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a different carbon, and when KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal; the positions are 1 and 3. Oh wait, perhaps it's a bridge structure so the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in the adamantane structure. Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridge is a carbon, right? So 1 and 3 positions may be across a bridge, so elimination might form a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, but KOH is a strong
