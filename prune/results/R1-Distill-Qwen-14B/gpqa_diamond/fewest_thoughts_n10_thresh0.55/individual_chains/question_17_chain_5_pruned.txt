Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf equals [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this solution, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex is present in stoichiometric amounts, I guess that the initial concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be such that they form the complex. But wait, when they form the complex, do they all get consumed? Or is there some excess?

No, wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be zero because they're all tied up in the complex. But that can't be right because the problem is asking about the free calcium ions. So maybe the complex dissociates a little, releasing
