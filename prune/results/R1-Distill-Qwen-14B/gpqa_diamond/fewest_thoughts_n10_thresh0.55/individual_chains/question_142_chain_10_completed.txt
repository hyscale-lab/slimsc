Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and qubit states. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must be a mixed state, right?

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector onto the state |0⟩, and same with |1⟩⟨1|. So when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, you're essentially averaging the two states. Oh wait, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because each state is equally likely, it's a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. Maybe it's about the Bloch sphere representation?

Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So r is the vector pointing from the origin to the point on the Bloch sphere.

Let me write out the Pauli matrices. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the density matrix in terms of r would be:

ρ = (1/2) [ [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ]

Wait, no, actually, the identity matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. So I is 2ρ, but perhaps I should compute ρ given our expression and find r.

Wait our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) /2. Let's compute that matrix. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so multiplied by 1/2, it's [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 1/2, and off-diagonal zeroes. Now, the general form for the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute that:

(I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) /2.

Expanding each term:

I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

r_x σ_x /2 is r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]/2 = [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

r_y σ_y /2 is r_y * [[0,-i],[i,0]] /2. Hmm, but since the given ρ has real entries (it's a density matrix?), the imaginary parts must cancel out. So maybe r_y is zero.

r_z σ_z /2 is r_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] /2 = [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2 ].

Adding all terms together:

The diagonal terms are (1/2 + r_z/2) and (1/2 - r_z/2). The off-diagonal terms are (r_x/2) and (r_y/2) in the top right and bottom left (but the bottom left will have r_x/2 as well if I'm not mistaken, but wait, σ_x is symmetric, so both off-diagonal terms are r_x/2.)

Wait, but our given ρ is diagonal, so the off-diagonal elements must be zero. So from r_x/2 = 0 and r_y/2 = 0, since the off diagonal terms in our given rho are zero. Therefore, r_x and r_y must be zero.

So r_x = 0, r_y = 0.

What about the diagonal terms? Our rho has both diagonal elements 1/2. So from the general form,

rho[0][0] = (1/2)(1 + r_z) = 1/2
rho[1][1] = (1/2)(1 - r_z) = 1/2

So let's set up equations:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z=0.

So r_z is zero. So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). That would put the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is r=(0,0,0).

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

### Step 1: Expand the general form
The identity matrix is \(I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), and the Pauli matrices are:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the general form of \(\rho\) becomes:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} + r_x \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + r_y \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} + r_z \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

### Step 2: Match with the given \(\rho\)
The given \(\rho\) is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(1/2\), and the off-diagonal elements are zero:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

From this, we observe:
1. The off-diagonal terms must be zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\) (since the off-diagonal terms depend on \(r_x\) and \(r_y\)).
2. The diagonal terms are both \(1/2\), which implies \(r_z = 0\) (since the diagonal terms depend on \(r_z\)).

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\(r = (1, 1, 0)\))**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.
- **Option B (\(r = (0, 0, 1)\))**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **Option C (\(r = (0, 0, 0)\))**: Correct, as this corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D (\(r = (1, 1, 1)\))**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.

### Final Answer:
The geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).
