Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, some reagents are commonly used. Maybe something like LiAlH4 (lithium aluminum hydride) or NaOH? Wait, but NaOH is more of a base. LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent, right? But wait, the question mentions that X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So maybe it's an element that has common isotopes, like chlorine or something.

Let me break down the reactions mentioned. So, X reacts with Y to give gas W, precipitate G, and B upon heating G. The melting point of B is about 277 K. Let me think about what substance has a melting point near that. Water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is water, but that's a guess. Or maybe it's another compound.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So, the molecular formula of W must be such that each atom contributes equally. Let's think about common gases. CO2 is a gas, but its molecule is linear. Wait, but the molecule's neutrons and protons are the same. Wait, each molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom in the molecule?

Wait, the question says, "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Hmm. So, perhaps each molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let me think. For example, H2O: each molecule has 10 protons (H:1 each, O:8) and 10 neutrons (O has 8 neutrons,
