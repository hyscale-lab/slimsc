Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think. 

I remember that the Sun's core has these fusion reactions, right? The main one is the proton-proton chain, and there are different branches. Oh wait, the question mentions the pp-III branch. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which later fuses with a proton to make lithium-7, and then eventually turns into helium-4. 

So, the scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions continue as usual. The question is about the ratio of the flux in two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, solar neutrinos are mainly produced by two main processes: the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain is more dominant at lower temperatures, while the CNO cycle becomes more important in hotter stars. But the Sun is mostly pp, right?

The pp-I branch is the main one, where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3. Then, those helium-3 nuclei can either combine (pp-I branch) or undergo other reactions, like the pp-III branch. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves a helium-3
