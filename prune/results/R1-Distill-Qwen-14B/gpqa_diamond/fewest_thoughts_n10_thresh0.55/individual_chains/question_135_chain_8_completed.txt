Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see. The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, I think I read that wrong. Let me look again. Oh, right, the interaction term is actually written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, I think that's the interaction term. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the notation. Let me parse it correctly.

So, the interaction term is -λ f times the product of ψ̄_f and (v + X) and ψ_f. So that must be the coupling term. So, this looks like a Yukawa coupling, similar to how the Higgs field couples to fermions in the Standard Model. So, this boson X is interacting with fermions, and the coupling is proportional to λ times (v + X).

Wait, but the v is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV) because in the Standard Model, the Higgs VEV is v about 246 GeV. But wait, in this problem, v could be part of the interaction term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the term is actually (v + X), but I'm not sure. Or maybe v is just a constant here.

But moving on. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV, right? Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So, the possible decay channels are pairs of particles (like fermions and their antiparticles). The possible fermions would be the ones that X can interact with. Because the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are fermions. So the fermions that X can decay into would be the ones present in this term.

Wait, but the term is -λ f ψ̄ ψ (v + X). So f is probably the fermion species, like up quark, down quark, etc. So the interaction is with fermions f, which are the same in ψ_f. So X can decay into any of the fermions f and their antiparticles.

Wait, but what are the possible fermions? The possible decay products are pairs of fermions. So for X to decay into a pair, each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV each (since 2m < 6 GeV, so m <3 GeV). So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so X (6 GeV) can't decay into top quarks. Similarly, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So can't decay into b quarks either.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into two particles, each must have mass less than 3 GeV. Because 2m < 6 GeV → m <3 GeV.

So which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV? Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact masses. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to remember approximate masses:

- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but we can ignore for this problem.

Wait, so X can decay into fermions where each has a mass less than 3 GeV. So which of these fermions have masses below 3 GeV?

Looking at the list:

- Electron (0.5 MeV): yes
- Muon (105 MeV): yes
- Tau (1.78 GeV): 1.78 <3 GeV, so yes
- Up quark: yes
- Down quark: ~5 MeV, yes
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV, yes
- Charm quark: 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so yes
- Bottom quark: 4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no
- Top quark: way too big, no.

Wait, so the possible fermions that X can couple to are the ones with mass less than 3 GeV. So that would be all the up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau, and their corresponding antiparticles.

Wait, but the interaction term has ψ_f. So the fermions that X can interact with are the ones present in the term. So which fermions are present? The term is written as ψ_f, which could be any fermion that the coupling allows.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present in the interaction. Oh wait, the interaction is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So f is perhaps the flavor index. So the interaction could be with any fermion f that couples to X.

Wait, but the fermions that can be decay products of X must be the ones that X can interact with. So the possible decay channels would be into any pair of fermions that X can couple to, provided their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but the problem gives X a mass of 6 GeV, so the possible decays are into pairs of fermions whose mass is each less than 3 GeV.

So which fermions are allowed? Let's see:

- u: 2 MeV → yes
- d: 5 MeV → yes
- s: ~100 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes
- mu: 105 MeV → yes
- tau: 1.78 GeV → yes
- but not b or t, as their masses are too high.

So possible decay channels for X are any of these fermions and their antiparticles.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, so 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b quarks. So option A includes b, which is impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Wait, c has mass 1.5 GeV, which is okay. 2m is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c is allowed. So this includes c, which is allowed. So B is possible. Because X can decay into c and cbar. But wait, the mass of c is 1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV <6 GeV. So yes.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Wait, t is top quark, which is 173 GeV. Can't decay into t tbar. So C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Again, includes b which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the options.

Looking again:

Option B includes c cbar. So the possible decays include c, which is allowed.

Wait, what about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV. So 2m is 3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So the correct decay channels are all the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. So which options include those and exclude the others.

Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me look back at the given options.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, that includes all the allowed fermions except for b and t, which are too heavy.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but another thing to consider: the interaction term allows X to couple to the fermions in the term. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are included in the interaction. So perhaps the interaction is only with certain fermions, like maybe only charged leptons or something else. But the problem as given doesn't specify, so I think the interaction is with all possible fermions unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but the problem says, "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So the interaction term includes all possible fermions f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that is allowed kinematically.

So the only thing that matters is their masses. So as calculated, the allowed fermions are up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau.

So the decay options are into these fermion pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all of these except for bottom and top. So that's the correct choice.

So the answer should be B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term, \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f < m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition becomes \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions are approximately:

- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with masses less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
