Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. 

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma as 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... Right, a rhombohedral lattice is one of the seven crystal systems. It's a special case where the three lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles between them are all the same. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees. 

I remember that the interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, which is d = (a²(b²c²)) / (h²k²l² + ... something involving cosines of the angles, right?) Wait, maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice.

Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos αβ)/(a²b²) ... wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think for a cubic system, it's the Miller indices squared
