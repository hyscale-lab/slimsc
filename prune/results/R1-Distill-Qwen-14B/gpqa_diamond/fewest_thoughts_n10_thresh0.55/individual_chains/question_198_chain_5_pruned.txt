Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They’re asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^2- or something like that, where n is the number of SCN ligands. The blue one is the dithiocyanato, so n=2 maybe? Or wait, maybe the dithiocyanato is a specific complex, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^2- or maybe another one. But the question says the blue ones are dithiocyanato, so I think that's the Co with two SCN-.

Stability constants are given for four complexes. Stability constants, β, tell us about the stability of the complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63), so the most stable
