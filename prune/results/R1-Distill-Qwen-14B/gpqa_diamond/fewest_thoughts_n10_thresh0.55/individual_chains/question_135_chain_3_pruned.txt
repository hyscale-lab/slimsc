Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem says that the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by a certain Lagrangian. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met. The key factors here are the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it's decaying into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh, maybe that's a typo or shorthand. Probably, the interaction term is something like λ X ψ̄ ψ, meaning that the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the interaction term would be something like X ψ̄ ψ, which implies that X can decay into two fermions. For each fermion species, the decay is possible if the sum of the fermion's mass is less than the mass of X. Since X is 6 GeV, any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV (since 2m < M_X) is allowed.

Wait, but wait, actually, the condition for a decay to be possible is that the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than 6 GeV. But wait, actually, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to M_X / 2. Because when the fermions are at rest, the minimum energy required is 2m_f. So 2m_f ≤ M_X → m_f ≤ M_X/2.

So let me list the masses of the known fermions in the Standard Model. Let's see:

Leptons (like electrons, muons, taus):
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u), Down (d): light, masses around 2-5 MeV (so <<1 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95-105 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, ~173 GeV

So, for each fermion pair X → f f̄, the mass of the fermion has to be ≤ 3 GeV, since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait: actually, the rest mass of the fermion f must be less than or equal to M_X/2. So:

Looking at each fermion:

1. Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV < 3 GeV → allowed.
2. Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV <3 → allowed.
3. Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV <3 → allowed.
4. Up quark (u): ~2-5 MeV → allowed.
5. Down quark (d): ~5 MeV → allowed.
6. Strange quark (s): ~0.1 GeV (100 MeV) → allowed.
7. Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV → allowed.
8. Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → Not allowed.
9. Top quark (t): way too heavy → not allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact masses.

Wait, the bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV. So 4.7 > 3 → so X can't decay into b b̄. Similarly, top quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so even higher than X's mass.

So which fermions are allowed? Let's list them:

Leptons: e, μ, τ.

Quarks: u, d, s, c.

So possible decay channels would be X→ e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but looking through the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ
