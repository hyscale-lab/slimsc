Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I think. The question gives a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformal metric. Conformal because it's a scalar function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So, the metric is conformally flat, right? 

I think the area of a surface in a metric depends on the determinant of the metric tensor. For a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Let me write down the metric tensor components. Since it's diagonal, g_xx and g_yy would be [32 / (4 - x² - y²)], and g_xy = g_yx = 0. So the determinant det g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². 

Wait, but wait. No, because the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), which is the same as g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx⊗dx + dy⊗dy). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So the area element dA is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.
