Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum. Oh, right, P here is probably the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So each component (Px, Py, Pz) is a spin component operator.

The problem gives me the matrices for each component:

- Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
- Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
- Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction has no y-component. So the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, sometimes it's defined from the x-axis, but since it's in x-z, maybe θ is the angle from the x-axis? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. But for the purpose of building the operator, I think it's manageable.

The operator P along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of n with the vector operator P. So P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). Or wait, actually, it's the sum n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. 

So, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Let me write that out. n_x would be cosθ (if θ is measured from z-axis), but wait, sometimes it's from x. Let me think. For a direction in the x-z plane, θ is the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because when θ is 0, n points along x, and when θ is 90 degrees, it points along z. So yes, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So the operator P along n is P = cosθ * Px + sinθ * Pz.

Now, each of Px and Pz is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So substituting in:

P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's distribute the factors:

First term: cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0]]
Second term: sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[sinθ, 0], [0, -sinθ]]

Adding them together:

[ [sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, -sinθ] ] multiplied by (ħ/2).

So the P matrix is (ħ/2)
