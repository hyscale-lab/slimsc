Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. So the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- or something? Because stability constants usually relate to the formation of complexes. Let me recall, stability constant (β) is a measure of the tendency of a complex to form. Higher β means more stable.

The cobalt can form complexes with different numbers of SCN- ions. So the species would be Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4. Wait, but wait, the stability constants given go up to β4=16. So each β is for the nth complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN)^2+? Or does each β represent the formation step?

Wait, no, stability constants are usually given for the overall formation. For example, β for Co(SCN)_n is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^2- (or whatever charge). So for n=1, β1=9; n=2, β2=40; n=3, β3=63; n=4, β4=16.

Wait, but β is the overall constant for each step. Or is it the cumulative constant? Because sometimes you have stepwise formation constants. For example, the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ with K1=β1. The second step is CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)2 with K2=β2, and so on. So the cumulative β for each complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point.

But wait, the way the problem is phrased says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so perhaps each β is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. Let me think. For example, β1 is K1, β2 is K1*K2, β3 is K1*K2*K3, etc. So in that case, β3 would be 9*40*something? Wait no, because 9 is β1, then β2 is 40, which is K1*K2. Wait, 9 * something =40? That doesn't make sense. Because 9 * (K2) = 40 → K2=40/9 ≈4.444. Then β3 is 63, which is K1*K2*K3 → 9*(40/9)*K3=63 → (40)*K3=63 → K3=63/40=1.575. And β4 is 16, which is K1*K2*K3*K4 → 9*(40/9)*(63/40)*K4=16. Let's compute that. 9*(40/9)=40, 40*(63/40)=63; 63*K4=16 → K4=16/63≈0.254.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. I think maybe the problem is that the βs are the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the formation of the first complex (Co(SCN)^+), β2 is the formation of the second (Co(SCN)₂^2+), etc. So to get the concentration of each species, we might need to calculate the fractions based on these βs and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Alternatively, maybe each β is the overall formation constant for each complex. So for Co(SCN)_n^2−, the β is the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

But regardless, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached. So Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the dithiocyanato complex. We need to find what fraction of the total cobalt is in this form.

So the approach would be to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations relative to Co^2+.

But how do we proceed? I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the fraction of each complex depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula f_n = β_n [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but wait. The initial species is Co^2+. The complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc. So the fraction of each complex is given by β_n [SCN]^n divided by the sum of all β_k [SCN]^k terms, including the term for Co^2+ (which is 1, since β0=1). So:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the β's given are for the complexes. So for the nth complex, the cumulative β is β_n. Wait, but that's only possible if β1 is the first complex, β2 is the second, etc. So each β_n is the equilibrium constant for forming the nth complex.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but let me think. The overall expression is:

The total concentration of cobalt is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^2+] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]

But each of these concentrations can be expressed in terms of β and [SCN^-].

So, [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]
Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2
Wait, no. Wait, each β is the overall formation constant. So for Co(SCN)_n^2−, the formation is Co^2+ + n SCN^- → Co(SCN)_n^2−, and β_n is K = [Co(SCN)_n^2−]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n^2−] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So, the concentration of each complex is β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

The total Co concentration is the sum of [Co^2+] plus each complex concentration.

So,

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] [SCN]^1 + β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 + β3 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3 + β4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] ( 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

We can solve for [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] = [Co_total] / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n^2−] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n = β_n [Co_total] [SCN]^n / (1 + ... )

So, the fraction of each complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

That makes sense. So the fraction of each complex is directly proportional to β_n [SCN]^n.

So, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

So, f_2 = (β2 [SCN]^2) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, wait. Wait, when n=0, β_0 is 1, and [SCN]^0 is 1, so that term is 1.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So, let me compute each term in the denominator.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16,

[SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term for n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9

n=2:β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Now sum them all up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now the numerator for f_2 is β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let me compute that.

0.4 ÷ 2.3646 ≈ let's see. 2.3646 is about 2.365.

0.4 / 2.365 ≈ let's compute. 2.365 × 0.169 is approx 0.4 because 0.169 ×2=0.338, 0.169 ×0.365≈0.061815; total≈0.3998. So 0.169 → 16.9%? Wait, that's one of the options. Option D is 16.9%. But wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Let me do it step by step.

2.3646 × 0.169 → 2.3646 * 0.169.

Let me compute 2 * 0.169 = 0.338, 0.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.3646 * 0.169.

Wait, 0.3646 × 0.169:

Approximately, 0.36 *0.169 → 0.06084. So total approx 0.338 + 0.06084=0.39884.

Which is very close to 0.4 (since 0.39884 is 0.4-0.00116). So 0.169 would give 0.3988, which is just under 0.4. So perhaps f_2 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9% → option D.

But wait, wait, let me compute the exact value.

Compute 0.4 /2.3646.

Let me do this division:

2.3646 ) 0.400000

So 2.3646 × 0.169 = approx 0.3988 as above. So 0.169 gives 0.3988. The remainder is 0.4 -0.3988=0.0012.

So 0.0012 /2.3646 → approx 0.000507 → so the total is 0.169 + 0.000507 ≈ 0.1695 → ~16.95%.

So approximately 16.9% → which is option D.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation. Let me compute the denominator again.

Let me recount each term:

n=0: 1 → 1

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

n=3:63*(0.001)=0.063 → sum 2.363.

n=4:16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

Yes, correct.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 = ?

Let me compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Let me think in fractions. 0.4 is 400/1000, denominator 2.3646 is approximately 23646/10000.

Wait, 2.3646 = 23646/10000.

So 400/10000 divided by (23646/10000) = 400/23646 ≈ 0.01691.

Wait, that's 1.691%, which can't be right. Oh, wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the decimal. Let me calculate 400 divided by 23646.

Wait, wait, no. 0.4 / 2.3646 → 0.4 is 4/10, 2.3646 is about 23646/10000 as a fraction.

So (4/10) / (23646/10000) ) = (4/10) * (10000/23646) ) = (4 * 10000 ) / (10 *23646) ) = (40000) / (236460) ) = 40000 ÷ 236460 → let's compute.

236460 × 0.169 → as before, 236460 ×0.1 =23646; ×0.06=14187.6; ×0.009=2128.14 → sum 23646+14187.6=37833.6 +2128.14=39961.74 → which is 39961.74. 40000-39961.74=38.26 remains.

So 0.169 gives 39961.74, which is 38.26 less than 40000.

So 38.26 / 236460 ≈ 0.0001616.

So total is 0.169 + 0.0001616 ≈ 0.16916 or 16.916%.

So about 16.9%, which matches option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm assuming that's the n=2 complex. But sometimes, the color might correspond to a different complex. Does the question say which complex is blue? Well, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II)", which I think is [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}.

So according to the calculation, option D is 16.9%, which is the answer.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me double-check the sum.

Compute each term again:

n=0 →1.

n=1 →9*0.1=0.9 →1+0.9=1.9.

n=2 →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3.

n=3 →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363.

n=4 →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

Yes, correct.

So the fraction is 0.4/2.3646=0.169, or 16.9%.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

For the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺), \(n = 2\), so:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Compute each term in the denominator
- \(n = 0\): \(1\)
- \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
- \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
- \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator for \(f_2\)
The numerator for \(f_2\) is:

\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 0.4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(f_2\)
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately \(16.9\%\).

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
