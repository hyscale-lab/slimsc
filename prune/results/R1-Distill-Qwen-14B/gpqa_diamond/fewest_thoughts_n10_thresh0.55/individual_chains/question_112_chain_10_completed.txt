Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system can be expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates, and the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Wait, the problem says the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I think I need to normalize this first because right now it's just proportional, not necessarily a unit vector. So the normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Calculating the coefficients: The first term has (1+i), so the absolute value squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The second term is (2 - i), so the absolute value squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. Adding these together, 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like an anti-diagonal matrix? Or maybe a specific structure. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So this operator is an off-diagonal matrix, which suggests it's related to spin in some direction other than z. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator looks similar but scaled and multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait a second, the Pauli X matrix is usually represented as σ_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. If I multiply σ_x by ħ/2, I get exactly the matrix A. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. But wait, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So A will have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But the problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A. So first, I need to find what those eigenstates are, right? Because the question is asking for the probabilities when measuring in the eigenbasis of A.

Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize A and find its eigenstates, and then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates. Then the probabilities would be the square of the coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the operator A is proportional to σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So the eigenstates of A would be the same, but the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

Wait no, because operator A is (ħ/2)σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as σ_x, because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues.

So the eigenstates of A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), which I'll call |+x> and |−x> for the eigenstates of σ_x.

So, the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but we need to express it in the x-basis (eigenstates of A) to find the probabilities.

So let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

But wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So let's express |alpha> in terms of these.

Let me compute the expansion coefficients. Let me denote |alpha> as (a|up> + b|down>), with a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, we can write:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>

So:

a |up> + b |down> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) |up> + (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) |down>

So equate the coefficients:

a = (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2)
b = (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2)

So we have two equations:

1) c1 + c2 = a * sqrt(2)
2) c1 - c2 = b * sqrt(2)

Adding equations 1 and 2: 2c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2) => c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2)/2

Subtracting equation 2 from 1: 2c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2) => c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2)/2

Let me compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So a + b = (1+i +2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (3)/sqrt(7)
a - b = (1+i - (2 -i))/sqrt(7) = (1 +i -2 +i)/sqrt(7) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(7)

So c1 = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/2 = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = 3/(sqrt(14)) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) )? Wait, sqrt(14) is sqrt(2*7), so sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is 1/sqrt(7/2), but maybe it's easier to compute numerically.

Wait, let's compute the modulus squared of c1 and c2 for the probabilities.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

So let me compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

c1 = [ (a + b) sqrt(2) ] / 2
= sqrt(2)(3/sqrt(7)) ) / 2
So |c1|^2 = [ (sqrt(2)*3/sqrt(7)) / 2 ]^2
= (2 *9 /7 )/(4)
= 18/(28)
= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857

Similarly, c2 = [ (a - b) sqrt(2) ] / 2
Compute a - b again:

a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) 
= (1 +i -2 +i) / sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7)

So |a - b|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /7 = (1 +4)/7 = 5/7.

So |c2|^2 = [ |a - b| * sqrt(2)/2 ]^2
= (5/7) * (2) /4
= (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 and 5/14 is about 0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 64.29% and 35.71%. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is the closest, but option D has 0.61 and 0.29. Wait, but my calculation gives 9/14≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571. So the first probability is about 0.64, the second about 0.36. So option A, which has 0.64 and 0.36, seems to match the probabilities.

Wait, but let me check. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, a + b = 3/sqrt(7), so |a + b|^2 is (3)^2 /7 = 9/7.

Then |c1|² = | (a + b) * sqrt(2)/2 |² = ( |a + b|² ) * ( (sqrt(2)/2 )^2 )

Which is (9/7) * (2/4) )= (9/7) * (1/2) )= 9/(14) ≈ 0.6428.

Similarly, |a - b|^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /7 = (1 +4)/7 =5/7.

So |c2|² = | (a - b) * sqrt(2)/2 |² = (5/7) * (2/4) )= (5/7) * (1/2) )=5/(14) ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 0.6428 and 0.3571. So the first probability is approximately 0.64, the second approximately 0.36. So the options that have 0.64 and 0.36 are option A.

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar /7.

Wait, let me also compute the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is equal to <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so <A> = (ħ/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x is (alpha| σ_x |alpha). So let's compute that.

Express |alpha> in z-basis:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> 

So the conjugate transpose (bra) is:

<alpha| = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Compute σ_x |alpha>:

σ_x |alpha> = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

= [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So <alpha| σ_x |alpha> is the inner product of [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] and [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 - i) /7
Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) /7

Let me compute each:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2
= 2 -i -2i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= (2-1) -3i
= 1 -3i

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= (2-1) +3i
= 1 +3i

So sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

Divided by 7: 2/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7, so <A> is (ħ/2)(2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A's third value.

So the probabilities were approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7).

Hmm, my calculated average is ħ/7, which is option A. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state becomes:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), with \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Therefore, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Using the relations:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

we solve for the coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) in \( |\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle \). Equating coefficients, we find:

\[
a = \frac{c_1 + c_2}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad b = \frac{c_1 - c_2}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Solving for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), we compute:

\[
c_1 = \frac{(a + b)\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(a - b)\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Substituting \( a + b = \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( a - b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left|\frac{(a + b)\sqrt{2}}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left|\frac{(a - b)\sqrt{2}}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \). Using the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}, \quad \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
