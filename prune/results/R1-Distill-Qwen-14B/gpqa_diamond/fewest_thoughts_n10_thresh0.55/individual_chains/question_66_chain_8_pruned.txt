Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory). The options are 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, and 4. CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

First, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boostsâ€”the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it's like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. So if Poincare is respected, Lorentz should also be, right? Or do they have separate considerations here?

SMEFT is a framework where you write the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators that respect the same gauge symmetries as the SM. But what about other symmetries like Lorentz and Poincare? Well, the SM itself respects Lorentz symmetry. So in SMEFT, all the operators should respect the same symmetries as the SM, including Lorentz. So I think Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. The SM includes Poincare symmetry because it's formulated in Minkowski space. SMEFT should also respect this. Wait, but sometimes when you add higher-dimensional operators, could there be issues? I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to respect all the symmetries of the SM, so Poincare should be maintained. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

Then, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some theories do. Wait, but in SMEFT, when you add operators, do they have to respect CP? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that in SMEFT, operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Because the SM doesn't have a global symmetry, but some operators could violate CP. For example, the QCD axion models might involve operators that break CP, but that's in the context of specific models. So I think operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a big one. CPT combines Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The SM respects CPT, and in fact, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formalism and the requirements for unitarity lead to CPT symmetry. So if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it must respect CPT. Since SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT. So all operators must respect CPT.

So putting it together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT?

- Lorentz (1): Yes.
- Poincare (2): Since it's part of the framework, yes.
- CP (3): No, not necessarily.
- CPT (4): Yes.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So the operators must maintain Lorentz symmetry, which in turn requires that CPT is also maintained. Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So operators must respect both Lorentz
