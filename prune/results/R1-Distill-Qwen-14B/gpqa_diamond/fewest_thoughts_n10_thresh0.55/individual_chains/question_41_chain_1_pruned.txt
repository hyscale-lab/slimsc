Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to process this step by step. 

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Interesting. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the way light propagates in it. But how exactly?

I recall that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, the speed would normally be c/n. But since the glass is moving, I think I need to consider the velocity of the medium relative to the observer when calculating the overall speed.

Wait, but this might involve some relativistic considerations. Oh wait, no, the options don't involve any gamma factors, so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or perhaps the problem is using the Galilean transformation, which is the case for low velocities compared to the speed of light.

In the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light's speed in the glass would be affected by the motion of the glass. But how?

In the rest frame of the glass, the light travels at speed v_light = c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that change?

Wait, I think this is a case where we apply a velocity addition formula. In classical mechanics, the velocity of an object in one frame is different from another frame moving relative to it. The Galilean transformation says that velocities add up linearly. So the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be the speed in the glass's frame plus the glass's velocity, right?

So if in the glass frame, light is moving at v_light = c/n. But wait, the direction matters. Let me think about the direction.

The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the
