Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

The options are about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so we need to figure out the transit probability for each.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Specifically, the transit probability (p) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is p = R_planet^2 / (R_star^2 + a^2), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, maybe p is the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star. Because when the planet passes in front, the area blocked is the planet's disk over the star's disk.

Right, so the transit probability is p = (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, is that all? Because the actual probability also depends on the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (relative to the star) and the star's size. Wait, no, that's not exactly right either.

Wait, no, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet must be in the correct orbital plane (edge-on) for a transit to happen, and the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet from the star. Because the orbital plane's orientation is a random angle, the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit is (R_star / a). Wait, but isn
