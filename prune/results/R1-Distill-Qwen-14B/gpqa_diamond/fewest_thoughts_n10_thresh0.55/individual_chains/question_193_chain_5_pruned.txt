Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, that's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, so if plx is 1/r, then r is 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the equation. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting r into that, since plx is 1/r, it's 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is the same as r^5. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, plx is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is r = 1/plx. So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, that would be N proportional to r^5 because plx is 1/r, so (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, so it's the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance
