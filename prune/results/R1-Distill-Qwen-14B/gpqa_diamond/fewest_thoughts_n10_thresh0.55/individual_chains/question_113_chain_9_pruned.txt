Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me go through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with similar structures but varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. 

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups. Because a broad peak is often from hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, usually around 2500-3300, but maybe more around 2500? Also, the presence of a broad peak could also be from an -OH group, maybe in an alcohol or something else with hydrogen bonding.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, which might indicate something else. Maybe an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching? Or an amide? Wait, amides have N-H stretching as well, but I don't see any info about that in the IR here. Alternatively, the 1650 could be another carbonyl group, but at a lower wavenumber, which might suggest conjugation or something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe an acid. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring. But wait, that's usually around 1600-1450, so maybe not. Another thought: maybe the 1650 is a carbonyl with conjugation, like a conjugated ester or a lactone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent causing a different peak.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. The problem states that there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydro
