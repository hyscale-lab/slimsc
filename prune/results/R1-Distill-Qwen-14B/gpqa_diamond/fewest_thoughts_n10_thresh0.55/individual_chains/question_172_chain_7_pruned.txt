Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres.

So the setup is that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small part of the star's photosphere is in equilibrium with a blackbody at a certain temperature.

Wait, when they say the atoms are twice as excited, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the Saha equation. The Saha equation describes the ionization and excitation states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere. It relates the number of ions or excited atoms to the electron pressure and temperature.

The Saha equation for excitation (not ionization) should be something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * ( (2π m_e k T)^(3/2) ) / (h^3 n^3) ) * e^(-chi/(kT)), where chi is the excitation energy. But wait, since we're comparing two stars, maybe we can simplify by taking the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio of upper to lower states in star_1 (let's call it R1) is twice that of star_2 (R2). So R1 = 2 * R2.

But since we're looking at the same energy level difference for both stars, the chi (excitation energy) is the same for both. So the main difference comes from the temperature. Let's model this.

Let me write the Saha equation for both stars. For star 1: R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * (2π m_e k T1)^(3/2) / (h^3 n^3) * e^(-chi/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star 2: R2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * (2π m_e k T2)^(3/2) / (h^3 n^3) * e^(-chi/(k T2)).

Since the gas density n and other constants are the same for both stars (assuming similar conditions, which the problem doesn't specify changing), the ratio R1/R2 should be [(2π m_e k T1)^(3/2) / (2π m_e k T2)^(3/2)] * e^(-chi/(k T1) + chi/(k T2)).

Wait, let's take the ratio:

R1/R2 = [ (T1/T2)^(3/2) ] * e^{ chi (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) }.

But according to the problem, R1 is twice R2, so R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = (T1/T2)^(3/2) * e^{ chi (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) }.

Hmm. The problem gives chi as
