Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. There are four matrices given: W, X, Y, Z. And four options (A to D) about statements related to these matrices. I need to choose the correct statement.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices represent various operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, which correspond to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, on the other hand, is unitary because it must preserve the norm of the state vectors. So, unitarity is key there.

Let me look at each matrix and see what properties they have.

Starting with matrix W:

W is given as:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Hmm, I need to check if W is Hermitian and/or Unitary.

Wait, a matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. W is real, so its conjugate transpose is the same as its transpose. Let's compute the transpose of W.

W^T would be:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W, so W is symmetric. So W is equal to its transpose, which means it's Hermitian because all elements are real. So W is Hermitian, meaning it could represent an observable.

Next, is W unitary? A unitary matrix satisfies UU† = I. Let's check if W*W† is identity. Since W is real and symmetric, its transpose is equal to itself, so W† is W. So W squared is:

W^2 = W * W:

First row:
(0*0 + 0*0 +1*1, 0*0 +0*1 +1*0, 0*1 +0*0 +1*0) → (1,0,0)
Second row:
(0*0 +1*0 +0*1, 0*0 +1*1 +0*0, 0*1 +1*0 +0*0) → (0,1,0)
Third row:
(1*0 +0*0 +0*1, 1*0 +0*1 +0*0, 1*1 +0*0 +0*0) → (0,0,1)
So W^2 = identity matrix. So W is unitary because W† is W and W*W† is identity.

So W is both Hermitian and Unitary. Wait, can a matrix be both? Oh, yes, because for unitary matrices, if they are Hermitian, their eigenvalues lie on the unit circle and are either +1 or -1. So in this case, W is a Hermitian unitary matrix.

Wait, but observables are Hermitian, and the evolution operator is unitary. So if W is both, perhaps it can serve as either, but that depends on context.

Now look at matrix X:

X is:
i
