Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and there are four options provided.

Wait, meson decay... I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I vaguely recall is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta * c), so L = c * tau * beta. Or wait, is it L = gamma * beta * c * tau? Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, right?

Right, because the lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the mean path length would be L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau from the given width? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Therefore, tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact relation is tau = ħ/(Γ), so I can use that.

So first, I need to find the lifetime tau. Then, find gamma and beta based on the energy and mass.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Compute the Lorentz factor gamma = E / (m c²), but wait, E is the total energy. Or maybe E is the kinetic energy? Hmm, in high-energy physics, when they say the production energy, I think it's the total energy. Because the mass is given as 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy.

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²), assuming that E is the total energy. So gamma = E / m_X c². But wait, in units where c=1, that's E/(m_X). Since E and m_X are given in GeV, and the speed of light squared is (c^2) which is 1 in those units. So gamma would be 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

But wait, let's compute it exactly: 8 / 1.2 is 6.666666..., so 6.6667.

Next, find beta, which is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, no, another approach: since E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)^2. So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Then, since E=8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So p c = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = around 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Beta is (p c) / E. So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = approx 0.98875. Let me compute it more accurately. 7.91 divided by 8 is 0.98875.

Alternatively, another way: beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). Since in this case, E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², but when squared and divided, the units will cancel. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2)^2 / (8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225)
