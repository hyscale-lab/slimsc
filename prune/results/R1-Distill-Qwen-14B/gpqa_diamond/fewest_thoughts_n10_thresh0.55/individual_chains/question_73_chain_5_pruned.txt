Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different v_rel and E.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. Relativity comes into play. So I'll probably need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed. And for the total energy, I think I'll need to calculate the energy of each astronaut individually and add them together.

Wait, the relative speed. So if one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c because that's what you'd get in classical mechanics. But relativity says that's not the case. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but which one is u and which is v here? Since they're both moving in the same direction, I think I need to subtract their speeds. Since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. No, wait. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if I'm finding the relative speed of B from A's frame, u is the speed of B as measured in the lab frame (which is 0.5c), and v is the speed of A (0.6c) as measured in the lab. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Because if you're in the rest frame of astronaut A, you want the speed of astronaut B as seen from A's frame.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, B is
