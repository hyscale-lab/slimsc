Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. Okay, I think this involves the Boltzmann equation for the distribution of particles in energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states based on temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The Boltzmann factor is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy. The ratio n1/n2 depends on temperature T.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. But wait, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? But the overall effective temperature is an average. Oh, but here, the problem says when the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the whole photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present?

Wait, no, maybe not. Because spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the surface is at a higher temperature. Wait, no, the problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average is 5500 K. But the question is about the photospheric conditionsâ€”so perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. But wait, the problem says the effective temperature when there are spots is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average is 5500 K. Or does it? Hmm. Wait, the way the problem is
