Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to walk through it step by step.

The question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through B, C, D, then E. There are also some hints provided, so I'll need to use those to figure out the structure.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints are:
a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A shows a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at ~1715 cm^-1.

Options are four different cyclo ketones.

Wait, so the IR peaks are crucial. The 1750 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. So A must have a carbonyl. Then, E's peak is around 1715, which is also a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or ester. But since E is the product after elimination, perhaps a ketone?

Looking at the reaction steps, let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically involves a ketone reacting with HCN to form a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group.

Wait, wait, but sometimes when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds to the carbonyl, forming a geminal diol, but under certain conditions, like in the presence of a catalyst, perhaps a more stable structure forms. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde, but aldehydes are more reactive towards HCN. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the structure after the first step. Let's say A is a cyclohexanone. Then adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which would be a cyclohexanol with a CN
