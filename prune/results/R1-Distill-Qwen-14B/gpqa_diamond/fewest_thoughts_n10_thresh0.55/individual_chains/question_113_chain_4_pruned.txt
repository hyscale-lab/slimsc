Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the question lists the characterization techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different formulas, all with varying numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the presence of a broad peak could also be due to an -OH group in something else, maybe a phenol or an alcohol. I should keep that in mind.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone (around 1700-1750), aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's a carbonyl in something else, like an amide? Hmm, but I don't see any data pointing to amides here. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch, especially if the compound has a conjugated system.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group, or perhaps an aromatic ring, but more likely an alkene given the absence of other aromatic signals mentioned.

The mass spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to a (CH3CO) group, like an acetate. The acetate ion is a common fragment, especially in esters or other compounds where an acylium ion can form. Alternatively, it could be a ketene or something else, but acetate seems more likely.

Now, let's piece this together. The compound has an O-H (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (from 1700),
