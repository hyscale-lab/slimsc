Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux is the number per cm² per second, right?

First, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is part of the pp chain. So if the pp-III stops, that affects the production of neutrinos from that process.

Wait, neutrinos are produced via the beta decay steps in these reactions. For the pp chain, I think the dominant neutrino is the electron neutrino, ν_e. The main process is when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. Alternatively, the pp-I and pp-II branches might produce different neutrinos, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question states that only the pp-III branch stops. So all other reactions continue. So, the other branches of the pp chain and the CNO cycle are still happening. But pp-III is a specific part of the pp chain, perhaps involving higher energy reactions.

I think the pp-III branch is where two pro
