Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's asking for. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use special relativity, not classical mechanics. 

So, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative speed is about how fast one is moving with respect to the other. Oh right, so I need to calculate the relative velocity between them, not just their speeds in the same direction. Because if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply 0.6c minus 0.5c. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. I think I remember the velocity addition formula from relativity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/cÂ²). But wait, no, that's when you're changing frames. But in this case, each astronaut is in their own frame, but I think the relative speed is calculated using that formula. Let me think. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second would be moving at (0.6c - 0.5
