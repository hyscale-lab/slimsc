Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon and moving to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state must be the next possible energy level. But wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. So the molecule's state is determined by both its rotational and vibrational quantum numbers.

The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is a bit different from the rigid rotor. Oh wait, no, maybe the non-rigid rotor is another name for the rotational model where bond length can vary, but the question includes a fixed bond length. Hmm, maybe that's a different consideration. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the standard rotor model.

So the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in terms of rotation and vibration... Wait, for a diatomic, the vibrational energy levels are quantized. The ground state is the lowest vibrational energy level, which is usually n=0. But the rotational energy levels are quantized too, with quantum number J. So the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state vibrationally (n=0) and the lowest rotational state, J=0 or J=1? I think for a rigid rotor, the ground rotational state is J=0, but maybe for non-rigid it's different. Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model is about the bond length changing, but the energy levels are still quantized.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. The rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, and the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, J is the rotational quantum number. For the vibration, the energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w n, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2,...).

So the ground state is n=0 and J=0. The next state would be the next possible energy level. But wait, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think it's the next higher energy state after the fundamental.

The fundamental state is n=0 and J=0. The next state would be either n=1, J=0 or J=1, n=0. Which one is lower in energy? Let's calculate their energies.

The vibrational energy for n=1 is E_vib = 0 + h w *1 = h w. The rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = [ħ²/(2I)] * 1*(1+1) = 2 * [ħ²/(2I)] = ħ²/(I).

Wait, which is larger: h w or the rotational energy change?

Because if the photon's energy corresponds to the smaller energy difference, that's the next state. So I need to compute both and see.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. The energy of the photon is E = h f, where f is the frequency. Momentum p of the photon is p = E / c = (h f)/c. But wait, since E = pc for a photon, yes.

So I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) and the next possible state. Which state is next? It could be either the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (n=0, J=1), depending on which requires less energy.

Let me compute both ΔE options.

First, compute the vibrational energy change. ΔE_vib = h w (from n=0 to n=1).

Then, compute the rotational energy change. The energy for J=1 is E_rot = [ħ²/(2I)] * 2. So the change is E_rot = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I.

So I need to calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot to see which is smaller. The smaller one would be the next state, so the photon's energy would correspond to that.

Let me compute the values.

First, compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ r². μ is the reduced mass. The masses given are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, converting that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ about 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 20/11 is approximately 1.81818.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute:

1.818 *1.6605 = ?

1.6605 * 1.8 = 2.9889, 1.6605 *0.018= approx 0.029889.

So total is ~3.0188 kg.

Wait, but 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is (1.81818 *1.6605) × 1e-27.

1.81818 *1.6605 = let's calculate:

1.6605 * 1.81818.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

Breaking it down:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = (1 + 0.8 + 0.01818) * 1.6605.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 × 1 = 1.81818

1.81818 × 0.6 = 1.090908

1.81818 × 0.06 = 0.1090908

1.81818 × 0.0005 = 0.00090909

Adding all together: 1.81818 + 1.090908 = 2.909088; + 0.1090908 = 3.0181788; + 0.00090909 = approx 3.01908789.

So about 3.019e-27 kg.

Now, r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, compute the rotational energy for J=1.

E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1) for J=1.

Wait, ħ is hbar, which is h/(2π). Let me see, h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 / 6.283 ≈ approx 1.054e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-34)^2 = approx 1.111e-68 J² s².

Wait, but E_rot is (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1). For J=1, J(J+1)=2.

So E_rot = (1.111e-68 )/(2 * 1.2076e-46) ) * 2.

Wait, let me compute denominator first: 2I = 2 * 1.2076e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So (ħ²)/(2I) = 1.111e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ 4.602e-23 J.

Multiply by J (J+1)=2: 4.602e-23 * 2 ≈ 9.204e-23 J.

So E_rot ≈ 9.204e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change is ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Compare that with E_rot which was about 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, 9.2e-23 is much less than 2.65e-19. So the rotational energy difference is smaller. So the next state would be the J=1, n=0 state. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy change.

Wait, but wait. Are we supposed to consider that the molecule can also change both its vibrational and rotational states? Because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". The lowest energy next state is the one with the smallest ΔE. Since ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vib, the photon would cause the molecule to transition to the next rotational state, not the vibrational.

So the energy of the photon should be approximately 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for E_rot.

Wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through again.

I = μ r² = (20*2)/(20+2) * amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier because μ is in amu, which needs to be converted to kg.

Wait, let me recompute μ correctly.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 +2) amu )= (40)/(22) amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Then ħ²/(2I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2076e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2076e-46 = 2.415e-46 kg m².

So (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) = approximately 4.606e-23 J.

Multiply by J(J+1)=2 for J=1: 4.606e-23 *2=9.212e-23 J.

So E_rot ≈9.212e-23 J.

ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So yes, the rotational energy is much lower.

So the photon's energy should be 9.212e-23 J.

But wait, what about the vibrational energy? Because sometimes the next state could combine a vibrational and rotational change. But in terms of the energy, the smallest possible ΔE is the rotational one, so that's the transition we're considering.

So the photon's energy is E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

But the problem is to find the momentum of the photon. Since E = p c, where c is the speed of light (approx 3e8 m/s), so p = E/(c).

So p ≈ 9.212e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But wait, none of the options seem to match that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 N s. Because 1 N s = 1 kg m/s. So 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small.

Hmm, wait. Did I make a mistake in calculating E_rot? Or perhaps I should consider that the transition is from J=0 to J=1 for the same vibrational state.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of E_rot. Let me compute it again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited state, which would be n=0, J=1, but perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0), and the rotational state is kept at J=0. Because sometimes, the fundamental state is considered as the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state with the lowest possible energy is the first vibrational excited state, not the rotational one. Because in some cases, the vibrational energy spacing is larger than the rotational. Wait, in our case, ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J, and ΔE_rot is about 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller. So the rotational transition would require a lower energy photon.

Wait, but maybe the molecule's next state is a combination, like n=1 and J=0. Because the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state. The next state would be the first energy level higher than the fundamental. But the energy levels are quantized in a way that the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever is lower in energy.

So in our case, the next state is the J=1, n=0 state, because that requires a smaller energy jump.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to a momentum p = E/c = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should compute μ in kg correctly. Let me re-calculate μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ =1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that exactly.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = ?

1.81818 * 1.6605 = let me compute:

1.81818 *1.6605:

Break it down:

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.029999.

So total is approximately 3.0189.

So 3.0189e-27 kg.

r =2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0189e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.20756e-46 kg m².

Now, calculate ħ²/(2I).

ħ = h/(2π) = 6.62607015e-34 J s / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2I =2 *1.20756e-46 =2.41512e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(2I) =1.112e-68 /2.41512e-46 =approx 4.606e-23 J.

E_rot = ħ²/(2I) * J (J+1). For J=1, 2.

So E_rot =4.606e-23 J *2 =9.212e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.212e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.212e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are higher. The options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns, which is 1e4 times larger than my calculation. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait—maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1e-31 is 0.1e-30, which is way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but the energy is the sum of the two.

Wait, but no, because the energy levels are quantized. The molecule can only transition to a higher state if the energy corresponds to the energy difference between two specific states. So the photon must match either the rotational or vibrational energy difference.

But since the vibrational transition requires higher energy, and the rotational requires lower, the next state would be the rotational one. So that's the photon's energy.

But the issue is that my calculated momentum is way lower than the options. Let's see—what could I have done wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Because if ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J, then p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns. Which is close to option D (1.4e-28) but not exactly.

Hmm. Let's compute ΔE_vib:

h =6.626e-34 J s, w =4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is an order of magnitude smaller than my calculation. Option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of E_vib. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, h is 6.626e-34, w is4e14. 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) =26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28).

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read again.

The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the molecule could transition to a state that's higher in vibration but lower in rotation, but it's not possible because each state is a specific combination. So the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy above the fundamental. So the next state would be the one with the smallest ΔE. Which is the rotational one.

But my calculation says that the rotational transition requires a photon with p=3e-31 Ns, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, maybe I confused E with ħ²/(2I). Let me double-check the rotational energy formula.

Rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) (2) - 0 = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, but wait: E for J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I). For J=0, the energy is 0. So the change is ħ²/(I).

So ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46) = ?

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.2076e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx 9.206e-23 J.

Same as before.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So the photon's energy would be about 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, and I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: The question is about the vibration part. So the photon's energy is the same as the vibrational energy, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns. That's around 8.8e-28, which is not exactly any of the options, but option A is 1.9e-28. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers or something else. Or perhaps the question is using the harmonic oscillator model and the vibrational energy is h nu, where nu is the fundamental frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, so the bond length isn't fixed, but I'm not sure how that affects the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent when calculating I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is 3.019e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m.

So r squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² =1.2076e-46 kg m². That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ħ²/(2I) again.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divided by (2 * I) =2.415e-46 kg m².

1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by J(J+1)=2 for J=1: 4.6e-23 *2 =9.2e-23 J.

Same as before.

So I'm confident that the rotational energy change is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational. But why would the rotational transition not be considered?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0). So the energy change is h w, but the problem is to compute the photon's momentum.

So E_photon =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon /c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28, but that's about a sixth of my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626 *4 =26.504.

e exponents: e-34 *e14 = e-20.

So 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the rotational energy, but my calculation gives a p that's not in the options. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the transition from J=0 to J=1 in the same vibrational state, and the energy is that rotational change. So p is 3.07e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me check the calculation again.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I=μ r² = (20/11 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, but wait! Oh! Wait a minute. No, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because when calculating I, we have to have μ in kg, and r in meters. Let me re-calculate I.

μ in kg:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40 amu²) / (22 amu) )=40/22 amu=20/11 amu≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.019e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=μ r²=3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So what's the issue? Because the photon's momentum I calculated isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps the problem expects the next state to be the first vibrational state (n=1) with J=0, not considering the rotational transition.

In that case, the energy would be h w =2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns. But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering both the vibrational and rotational transitions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the photon's energy to match the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy changes. But that would require a much higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure how that would translate into the photon's energy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Wait, my calculation for the rotational transition gives p=3.07e-31, which is 3e-31 Ns. That's about 3e-4 times smaller than option D. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the reduced mass correctly. Wait, no, the reduced mass was correctly calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, not meters.

Wait, no—r is given as 2 angstroms, which I correctly converted to 2e-10 meters.

Another possibility: Did I make a mistake in the calculation of ħ? Let me recheck.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

ħ = h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈1.054e-34 J s.

Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the Raman transition, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from quantum number J=0 to J=1, and the energy is twice the rotational constant.

Wait, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference for J=1 is 2B.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.054e-34)^2/(2 *1.2076e-46) ) ≈ approx 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculations, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which gives p≈8.8e-28 Ns, but the closest option is A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But why would the vibrational transition be considered the next state when the rotational transition requires a much smaller photon energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the next state as the first possible state, which could be either the vibrational or rotational. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, it's the next possible state. So the photon's energy should match that.

But again, my calculation gives a p that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the energy in terms of another unit. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation for the rotational transition. Let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

Wait, I think I have to compute ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46) )= 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx 9.206e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require even higher energy.

No, that's even higher. So the first transition is J=0 → J=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), thus requiring a photon with energy h w.

Which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used m/s for the speed of light instead of something else? No, c is 3e8 m/s, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's wavelength instead? The question asks for momentum, which is directly related to energy via E=pc.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the reduced mass in a different way. Or perhaps the bond length is given in a different unit.

Wait, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, the problem statement says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." That could be the first state that's higher than the ground state. The energy levels are arranged such that the next state is the one with the smallest possible ΔE.

So the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next possible state is either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1). Which has lower energy? Let's compute both.

E(n=1, J=0) = E_vib(n=1) + E_rot(J=0) = h w + 0 = h w =2.65e-19 J.

E(n=0, J=1) = E_vib(n=0) + E_rot(J=1) =0 + 9.2e-23 J=9.2e-23 J.

Since 9.2e-23 J < 2.65e-19 J, the next state is (n=0, J=1). So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition despite the higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me re-calculate I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg, so μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.019e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem expects the use of the rotational energy for J=1, which is 2B, where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I), so E_rot = B J (J+1).

For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=2B.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.2076e-46) ) =1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 =4.606e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.606e-23 =9.21e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational energy at all, and it's just a typo, expecting the vibrational transition. But why would the question mention the non-rigid rotor model then?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state with the same rotational state, which requires a photon of energy h w. So p = h w / c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/(3e8) =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. 8.8e-28 is between options A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But wait, 8.8e-28 is about 6.3 times larger than option A, and about 6.3 times larger than D (1.4e-28 is about twice option D: 1.4e-28 is 1.4e-28, 8.8e-28 is 6.3 times that).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me double-check the calculation.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Yes.

So the momentum is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first excited rotational state with the same vibrational state, which would require a photon with p=3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any options.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer intended by the question is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, but I don't see how to get that from the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me compute h w again.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e (-34 +14) )=26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the use of the rotational energy, but with a different calculation.

Wait, another possibility: Did I mix up the formula for the rotational energy?

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

Yes.

Wait, but what if I forgot to multiply by 2? No, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, leading to E=6B. But that would be even higher than the previous options.

So I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to go with the rotational transition, which gives a photon momentum of approximately 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option to this is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28).

Wait, 8.8e-28 is about 6.3 times option A, and 6.3 times option D.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me see: perhaps the angular frequency is given in terms of 4e14 per second, but perhaps the calculation requires using w in a different way.

Wait, no—h w is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy as (3/2) h w, but that's not right.

Wait, no. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (1/2) h w + n h w, so the transition from n=0 to n=1 requires ΔE = h w.

Hmm.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns. But I don't see the reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, another possibility: Did I forget that the bond length is given as 2 angstroms but incorrectly used it elsewhere?

No, I think I used it correctly.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns. But I can't see how to arrive at that number from the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the rotational transition, but with a different value.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the rotational energy in terms of kg, m, s units again.

I = μ r² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg m².

ħ²= (1.05457e-34)^2=1.112e-68 J² s².

E_rot = ħ²/(I) =1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 =9.206e-23 J.

p = E_rot /c =9.206e-23 /3e8=3.068e-31 kg m/s =3.068e-31 Ns.

This is 3.07e-31 Ns.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer to be expressed in 1e-27 units. So 3.07e-31 is 3.07e-4 *1e-27 = 0.000307e-27, which is much smaller than any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I might need to look for another approach, but I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, with the molecule in its fundamental state (lowest energy state). The task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The fundamental state corresponds to the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could either be the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (n=0, J=1). The energy difference for these transitions determines which state is reached first.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Transition (n=0 → n=1):**
   The vibrational energy difference is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
   \]
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})(4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition (J=0 → J=1):**
   The rotational energy difference is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \cdot J(J+1)
   \]
   where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( I = \mu r^2 \), \( \mu \) is the reduced mass, and \( r \) is the bond length. The reduced mass is:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]
   The bond length is \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Thus:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]
   The rotational energy difference for \( J=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

### Comparison of Transitions:
- The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), leading to \( p = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).
- The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), leading to \( p = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \).

Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational state (J=1, n=0). However, the calculated momentum for this transition (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) does not match any of the provided options. The closest match to the vibrational transition is \( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which is approximately 6.3 times larger than option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated values and the provided options, the most reasonable choice based on the vibrational transition is **option A**.
