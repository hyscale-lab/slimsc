Okay, so I'm faced with this multiple-choice question about the distribution of stars and how their number changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean they're spread out evenly in space, or just on the celestial sphere? Oh wait, if they're uniformly distributed in the sky, maybe it refers to their angular distribution—so same density everywhere in the sky. But I might be mixing up terms here. Alternatively, it could mean that the stars are spread out uniformly in three-dimensional space, but from our point of view here on Earth, their distribution on the celestial sphere appears uniform.

Let me think about what parallax means. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula relating parallax to distance is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So a larger parallax means a closer star.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's asking how the number of stars, N, depends on plx. The options suggest different power laws: 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, etc.

I remember something about the density of stars in space and how their distribution affects observed counts. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a certain distance would depend on the volume. Volume increases with the cube of the radius, right? So for a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. If the number density of stars is n (stars per volume), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, how does this translate into parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation. The volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx). Wait, because dd would be change in d, but since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, the negative sign just indicates direction, but the magnitude is what's important here.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx with thickness dplx is N = n * 4π (1/plx
