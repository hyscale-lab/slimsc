Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay is c times this matrix. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by that would give the matrix for Ay.

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, so first I need to write down the matrix Ay. Let me compute that.

So, c = h/(4π). Then,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S

Therefore, each element of S gets multiplied by h/(4π). So the matrix becomes:

Ay = [ [0, (-i)(h/(4π)) ],
        [(i)(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Simplify that: The off-diagonal elements are ±i * h/(4π). So,

Ay = [ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
        [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

But wait, the problem says that Ay has the form c·S where c is h/4π and S is that 2x2 matrix. So yes, that's correct.

Now I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. For that, I should solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

The matrix Ay minus lambda I is:

[ [-λ, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Let me compute the determinant:

= λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Simplify the second term: (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the term is (1)*(h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is λ² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait a second, so the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Let me check: Ay is c·S. S has elements (0, -i; i, 0). The conjugate transpose of S would be (0, i; -i, 0), which is -S. So S is anti-Hermitian, right? Because S† = -S. So when you multiply by a real constant c, Ay is c S = c S. Then, Ay† would be c S† = c (-S) = -Ay. Oh, wait, that would make Ay skew
