Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. Then, it's heated with excess KOH. I think when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, it's an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum shows four signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR at 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Hmm, but wait, the initial reaction is elimination, so maybe it's not an alkene but an epoxide? No, wait, KOH and dihalide might form an ether if it's an SN2 reaction, but more likely, it's elimination to form an alkene. But the IR peak suggests a carbonyl. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since it's a dihalide, perhaps it forms an alkene. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Could it be that the product is a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing something else. Oh wait, another possibility: when two bromides are present, maybe elimination occurs twice, but wait, that would require more than two adjacent bromides. Wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so maybe the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead positions. So elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are not common because of Bredt's rule. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. No, that would require a peroxide. Wait,
