Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about reagents used in two different reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let's tackle the first reaction first. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think it's an example of a nucleophilic addition. Usually, ketones react with cyanide under certain conditions. Wait, but what conditions? Oh, right! I remember that when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with HCN or its equivalent, like NaCN, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, wait. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But in a basic or acidic solution?

Wait, the product is a nitrile. So butan-2-one plus NaCN gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize the product. The product structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone has been converted into a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, that's the cyanohydrin formation. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then a proton is added somewhere. So the mechanism is that the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes O- which picks up a proton to form the hydroxyl group.

But wait, the conditions for this reaction: I think the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the attack by CN- on the carbonyl, which is more electrophilic under acidic conditions. So H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more positive, encouraging the attack by the nucleophile (CN-).

Looking at the first reaction, reagent A is used. So A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+). Wait, but could it be something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a base?
