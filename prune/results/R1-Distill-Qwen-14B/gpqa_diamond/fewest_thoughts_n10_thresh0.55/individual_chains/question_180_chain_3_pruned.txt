Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let me read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, so the system consists of a charge at the center and twelve others arranged symmetrically around it at a fixed distance. Wait, but the charges all have the same charge, right? So 2e each. And since they're all the same, the potential energy will depend on how they interact with each other and with the central charge.

Wait, but the central charge is fixed. So the interactions would be between the fixed charge and the twelve others, and also between the twelve others themselves.

But wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So all the charges are part of the same system, and the energy is the sum of all their pairwise interactions.

Potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So the total potential energy of the system is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P.

So each of the 12 charges at distance 2m from P will interact with the fixed charge, and also with each other.

So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of two parts: U1, the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and U2, the energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a second. Since all the surrounding charges are identical, and they're all at the same distance from the fixed charge, the interactions between the fixed charge and each of the 12 are identical. So I can compute that once and multiply by 12.

Similarly, for the interactions between the 12 surrounding charges, each pair will contribute an energy term. How many such pairs are there? Well, for 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is combination of 12 taken 2 at a time, which is (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

So, U1 is the sum of each of the 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge. Each interaction is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, no. Wait, the fixed charge is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e as well.

Wait, no, the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair (fixed and each surrounding) has a charge product of (2e)*(2e)=4e². The distance between them is 2m.

So U1 for
