Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography here. Hmm, okay, I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are related to the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices of the plane. Let me think about how that works.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, but those angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, but wait, no, isn't a rhombohedral structure usually described as having all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees? So yeah, that fits.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between atoms, right? But for a crystal, the unit cell's edge length is probably the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic structure, the edge length a would be the interatomic distance. Oh but wait, in some structures like HCP or FCC, the interatomic distance is different. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, then each atom is at the corners, so the edge length a would be the interatomic distance. So in this case, a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but the (111) plane's interplanar distance—so I need to calculate that. The formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - ( hk + hl + kl )/(a^2 cos^2(theta) ), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another formula comes to mind: for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But this is a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a cubic system with non-90-degree angles?

Wait, no, the rhombohedral system is one of the seven crystal systems, and it's a special case where a = b = c and the angles can be alpha, beta, gamma. But the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit more complicated than the cubic case.

I think the formula for a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h
