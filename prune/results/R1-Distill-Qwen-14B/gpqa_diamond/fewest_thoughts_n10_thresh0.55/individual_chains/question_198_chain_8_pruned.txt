Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the various cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. So we're looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as a percentage of the total cobalt concentration.

Stability constants, or formation constants, relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, to find out the distribution of each complex, I probably need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex.

But wait, how many complexes are possible here? Let's see. The beta values are up to beta4=16. So that's four complexes, right? Each with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

But wait, the problem is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex in solution and then find which one is the dithiocyanato and sum that.

But how do the stability constants come into play? I remember that the fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general formula for the fraction f_n of a complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (beta_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to m
