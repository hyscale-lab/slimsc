Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator, and I'm a bit new to this so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator, so I think that means it's made up of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem states that each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Hmm, wait. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must have components (l, 0, m), because the y-component is zero. So the direction is arbitrary but lying in x-z, meaning the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, perhaps?

In quantum mechanics, when we talk about the operator for angular momentum along an arbitrary direction, it's usually given by the dot product of the vector operator and the direction vector. So P · n, where n is a unit vector.

Wait, but wait. The operator P is given as a vector operator, so I think the operator along n would be P_n = P · n. So, P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since we're given that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the eigenstate must correspond to the +1/2 state of the spin along the direction n.

Now, the spin operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as 2x2 matrices. Let me write them down.

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Each of these is multiplied by ħ/2, so when I build P_n, it's going to be a linear combination of these matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, the problem is to find the eigenvector of P along n. So I need to find the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.
