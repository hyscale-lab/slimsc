Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, alright. So, first, I remember that when dealing with the potential energy of a system of charges, we usually look at the electrostatic potential energy between each pair of charges. Since the system is isolated, we can assume that we're dealing with electrostatic forces, and we'll need to calculate the potential energy.

But wait, the charges are identical and have the same sign, right? Each has a charge of 2e. So, they're all positive. That means the potential energy between any two will be positive because same charges repel.

The setup is that 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

So, the system consists of the 13th charge (let's call it q0) at the center, and 12 charges (q1 to q12) each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So, their positions are fixed on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m centered at P. The 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, but for potential energy, I think we need to consider all pairs of charges. So, the potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But do I include all possible pairs? Oh yes, because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed. So, how does it interact with the others? The 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge.

So, the potential energy between q0 and each qi (
