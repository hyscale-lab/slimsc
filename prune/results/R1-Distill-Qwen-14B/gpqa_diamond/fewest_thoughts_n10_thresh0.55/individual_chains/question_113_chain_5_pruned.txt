Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR are usually indicative of O-H stretching. A broad peak here suggests the compound has an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually broader and stronger. Hmm, but alcohol's O-H is also broad. Another point: the absorption is at 3000, which is in the range for O-H. So, the compound likely has an -OH group.

Next, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typically where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe an amide? No, because amides have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1650. But then, without more info, not sure. Wait, the peaks are 1700 and 1650. Or another possibility: maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substitution. But wait, another thought: if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. But then, what about the 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring's stretching or another functional group.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. Several peaks were observed, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double
