Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again.

We have an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are provided.

Hmm, so I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is related to the arrangement of charges. Since all the charges are identical and positive (as they're multiples of e), I think the minimum energy would occur when the potential energy is minimized. Wait, but waitâ€”wait a second, no. Because for point charges, the potential energy is actually a measure of the work done to assemble them. For like charges, bringing them closer increases the potential energy. So, in a system of like charges, the potential energy is positive and increases as you bring the charges closer.

But wait, the problem is about finding the minimum energy. So maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the system is isolated, which means energy can't be exchanged with the surroundings. But the question is about the minimum energy, which probably refers to the minimum potential energy.

Wait, but when you have a bunch of point charges, the potential energy of the system is the work required to bring each charge from infinity to their positions.
