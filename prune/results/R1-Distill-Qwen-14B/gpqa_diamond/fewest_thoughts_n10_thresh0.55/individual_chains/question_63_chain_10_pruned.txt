Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's transition between energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are determined by both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition involves a change in rotation, vibration, or both. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotation and vibration, but wait, I think the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is X-Y, with masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that the energy levels for a diatomic molecule's vibration are quantized. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. And for rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

But wait, the question is about going from the fundamental state to the next lowest. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy, which is v=0 and J=0 maybe? Or is
