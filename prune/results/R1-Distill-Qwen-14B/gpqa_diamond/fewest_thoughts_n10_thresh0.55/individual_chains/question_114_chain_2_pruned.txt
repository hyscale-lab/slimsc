Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the question involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is about reacting 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (and H2O) to get 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN), what usually happens? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN would provide CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

In the product, we have a nitrile group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the same carbon. Wait, butan-2-one has a (CH3)2CO structure. Adding CN- might add to the carbonyl, resulting in a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. The reaction of a ketone with CN- (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst (like H3O+) produces a cyanohydrin. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, and water leaves, giving the diol nitrile.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid). Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So I can narrow down to options A or B for the first part.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but wait, no, the actual starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a cyanohydrin with a benzyl group attached. The product is the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-
