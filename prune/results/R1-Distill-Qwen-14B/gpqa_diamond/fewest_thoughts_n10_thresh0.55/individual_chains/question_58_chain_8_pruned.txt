Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when you go to high energies. The options are A through D: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. So regularization is a way to make these infinities manageable so you can calculate physical quantities that turn out to be finite after renormalization.

So, which theories don't need regularization? Well, if a theory is already finite, meaning all the integrals converge without any divergences, then you wouldn't need to regularize it. Or maybe if the theory is non-perturbative, but I'm not sure.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. It's a background-independent theory, right? But does it require regularization? Well, string theories are usually finite because they have a different structure, but wait, I'm not entirely certain. I recall that in string theory, the perturbative expansions are different, maybe leading to fewer divergences. But I'm not sure if they ever need regularization. Maybe in some cases, but perhaps not always.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom. Because of that, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But wait, QCD does involve things like confinement and the running coupling. But in terms of regularization, I think QCD calculations do require regularization because of divergences in loop integrals. So they must use methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a U(1) gauge theory and was the first successful quantum field theory. However, QED has issues with divergences in loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy and the vacuum polarization. So QED definitely requires regularization. But wait, I remember that in QED, the divergences are actually milder compared
