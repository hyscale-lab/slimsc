Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay distance (L) is L = γ * v * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the proper lifetime τ? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I should be careful with units here. Since Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s or something like that, I need to handle the unit conversions properly.

Let me jot down the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the Lorentz factor γ using the energy E and mass m. Since E = γ m c², and I can rearrange that to find γ.
3. Determine the velocity v of the particle. Since v is
