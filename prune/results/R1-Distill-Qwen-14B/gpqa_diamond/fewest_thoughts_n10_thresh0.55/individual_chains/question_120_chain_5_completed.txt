Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to think about this step by step.

Wait, first, what's parallax? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs) or something like that.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I imagine looking at the sky, how does the number of stars change as I look at stars with different parallax ranges.

Wait, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Probably uniformly in space, so their number density is the same throughout. But wait, no—wait, no, the distribution is uniform in terms of their positions on the sky. Or wait, no, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, but in reality, the number per unit area would be uniform. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax (p) is approximately 1/d (in parsecs), so d = 1/p. Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density n is uniform. So, the number of stars at a distance between d and d+dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd, and number density is stars per volume.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, instead of distance, we're looking at parallax. Let's change variables from d to p.

Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. The volume element in terms of p would require a substitution. Let's see: dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since p is small for large d, maybe I can relate the number of stars in a range of p to the volume in terms of d.

Wait, the number of stars between parallax p and p+dp would correspond to stars at distance d and d+dd, where dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (d)^2 dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) )= 4π (1/p^4) (-dp). But since we're considering dp as a positive increment, perhaps we can ignore the negative sign and just take the absolute value.

So the number of stars in a parallax interval dp is N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express this correctly.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So let's substitute:

Number of stars = n * 4π ( (1/p) )^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. So when considering a small positive dp, the number of stars would be proportional to (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Because the expression becomes 4π n (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = (4π n / p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, when you increase the parallax by a unit, how many stars do you get? So that would be the number per unit p, which is 4π n / p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx^4.

Wait, but wait another thought. The original distribution is uniform in the sky. Does that mean that the number of stars per unit area is constant? Or is it uniform in space, such that the number density is uniform? Hmm, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." So I think it's uniform in the sky, which implies that the number per unit solid angle is the same. So, perhaps I should model this using solid angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of flux or surface density. Suppose that the number of stars per unit area on the celestial sphere is uniform. But then, the number of stars at a certain distance depends on how much of the sphere is at that distance.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The number of stars in a thin shell between distances d and d+dd should be proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4π d²) times the number density of stars. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/p, then N = n *4π (1/p)^2 ( - (1/p²) dp ) )

So, N = n 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as 1/p^4. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the volume element in terms of p would be 1/p^4. So that's right.

Wait, but wait, another way: the number of stars per unit volume is n. So in a volume between d and d+dd, it's n * 4π d² dd. If I change variables to p, which is 1/d, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting:

N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp ) = (4π n / p^4) dp.

So N per dp is 4π n / p^4, which is proportional to 1/p^4, so option A.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The number of stars in a range of parallax \( dp \) becomes:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{4\pi n}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This means the number of stars decreases as \( p^4 \) increases.

From the given options:
- **A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \):** Correct, as derived above.
- **B) ~ \( 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ \( 1/p^1 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ \( 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^3 \).

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

Answer: A
