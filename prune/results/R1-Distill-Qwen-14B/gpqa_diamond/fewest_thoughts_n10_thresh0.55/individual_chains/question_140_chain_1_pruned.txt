Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. Let me jot down the key points:

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.
2. X reacts violently with Liquid Y, releasing Gas W.
3. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that probably means it's a noble gas because noble gases have atoms with complete valence shells, but wait, the molecule part confuses me. Oh, wait, some noble gases are diatomic, like O2 or N2, but wait, no, those aren't noble. Oh wait, maybe it's not a noble gas. Let me think: if a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, maybe it's something like H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and an O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So in H2O, the molecule would have 2*(1p,0n) + (8p,8n) = 10p and 8n. That's not equal. So maybe another gas.

Wait, the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible candidates. For example, CO2 is a gas but it's not a molecule with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe it's something like NH3? No, that's a liquid at certain temps. Wait, another approach: looking for a molecule where the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? Let's check. Carbon has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: Carbon usually has 6 neutrons (12C), and O has 8 each (16O). So 6 + (2*8) = 22 neutrons. Oh! So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That's equal. So CO2 could be Gas W. But wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the molecule has the
