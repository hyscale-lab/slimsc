Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is acidic and easily ionizes. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, but maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ester or something. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think amides are part of the options here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a ring or an isolated double bond.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, I should think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (CH3, m/z=15?), but wait, that's not 45. Oh, maybe a larger fragment. Wait, 45 could be a ketene ion (like CH2CO), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester or a cyclic ether. Wait, another possibility: the fragment might be (CH3)2CO which is acetone, but acetone's molecular ion is m/z=58. Oh wait, no, maybe a smaller fragment. Wait, m/z 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible ions. Maybe CH2CH2O? No, maybe a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30), but that's not matching. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group, but not sure. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the options, so perhaps the molecular weight can help. Let's see
