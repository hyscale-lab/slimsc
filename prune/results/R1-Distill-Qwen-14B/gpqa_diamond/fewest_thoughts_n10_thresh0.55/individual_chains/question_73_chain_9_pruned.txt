Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. So, there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So the problem is about relativistic speeds, which means I can't just use classical mechanics for velocity addition. Oh right, because at speeds comparable to the speed of light, classical addition doesn't work anymore. I remember that the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. Let me think about that formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Right, that's the one. So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what speed is B moving at?

Wait, but wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So looking at the options, the relative speed for options C and D is 0.14c. So options A and B can be eliminated based on the relative speed.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Wait, what's the total energy here? The system consists of both astronauts, so their energies (relativistic) should be added.

But wait, each astronaut's energy is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy, right? So first, I need to calculate the gamma factor for each.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(
