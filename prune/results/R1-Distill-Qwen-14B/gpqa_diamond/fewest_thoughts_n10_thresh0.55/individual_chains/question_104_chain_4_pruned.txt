Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, when the planet tugs the star, it makes the star move towards or away from us, which shifts the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, period ratio P2/P1.

I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-2/3) ) * ( (P/(2Ï€)) )^(-1/3) )).

Wait, but wait, since the stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), M_p and M_star are the same for both. So M_p sin i is same for both, and M_star is same, so they cancel out in the ratio.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = constant * P^(-1/3).

Wait, but wait, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_star)) )^(something) )

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula more clearly.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / [ ( (M_star +
