Okay, I've got this question about particle physics, and I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. Let me take it step by step.

So, the problem says the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if that's super important for determining the decay modes right now. Maybe the key point is the boson's mass and the possible particles it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, maybe it's a Yukawa-type interaction. So X couples to fermions. The term has ψ_f, which is a fermion field. But the problem is about decay, so perhaps the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair it can interact with.

But for that, the fermion masses must be less than the mass of X. Because in decay, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So X has 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

The fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's go through each type.

Quarks come in different flavors: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses (current masses) are roughly:
- u: about 2-5 MeV
- d: ~4-8 MeV
- s: ~95-105 MeV
- c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.1-4.4 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. The charged leptons have masses:
- e: ~0.511 MeV
- mu: ~105.7 MeV
- tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are much lighter, but I think for decay purposes, their mass is negligible.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions have a mass less than 6 GeV.

For quarks:
- u, d, s, c: all their masses are below 6 GeV. Wait, s
