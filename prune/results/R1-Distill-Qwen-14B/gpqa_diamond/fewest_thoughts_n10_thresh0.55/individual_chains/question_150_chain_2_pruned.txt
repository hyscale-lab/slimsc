Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to deduce the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about what that could be. Since there's an O and an N, maybe an aromatic amine or something with an amide? Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): Probably the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two protons. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have neighboring hydrogens (they're at the end). Hmm, maybe it's an enol form or something else. Wait, could it be an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde? Like an enal? Because in that case, the aldehyde proton might be split due to coupling with the adjacent double bond's protons. So a triplet would mean two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde attached to a CH2 group, but wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a conjugated system. Not sure yet, but I'll come back to that.

Other signals:

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet with two protons. Could be part of a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet. So maybe two sets of doublets, indicating a di-substituted benzene or two aromatic rings each with substituents.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe some exchangeable protons. Could this be -OH groups or an enol proton? Wait, in DMSO, OH protons can appear broad. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system like an enol, but the broadness suggests it's exchanging, so more likely OH groups.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the CH2 region. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe an OCH2 group, but wait, OCH2 would typically split into a quartet if adjacent to another CH2, but here it's a doublet. Alternatively, an NHCH2 group? But the molecular formula has N, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else.

Putting this together, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C
