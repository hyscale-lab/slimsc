Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different magnitude limits. Let me see, the problem says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES brighter than 16 mag. So both can see stars up to 17, but HIRES is a bit better with 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, right, so they can observe stars that are magnitude 17 or lower. Same for HIRES: apparent V mag brighter than 16, meaning they can see up to 16 mag. So, if a star has apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can only see up to 16. So the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO? Wait, no. Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, brighter than 17, meaning magnitude less than or equal to 17, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can detect up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag.

So a star must have an apparent magnitude â‰¤
