Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe like a dehydrohalogenation? Or wait, isn't that more for E2? Or perhaps it's about the hydrolysis of a nitrile or something else. I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

First, let's look at the spectral data given. The IR has peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, likely indicating an -OH group. There's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but the peak here is 3400-2500, which is a bit broader, maybe a hydroxyl group. The 1720 could be an ester or a ketone. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might be aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a phenolic OH, but phenolic OHs are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a very acidic one. Hmm, but in the IR, we have a broad peak that could be an O-H stretch, so maybe a carboxylic acid? Because the IR at 1720 could be a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700 cm-1 and a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. Wait,
