Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, Michael addition... I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. Right, because the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is more electrophilic due to conjugation.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each a different reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it's deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester. Its structure is O=C(CO2Me)2. So, under basic conditions, the alpha protons are deprotonated to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The alpha-beta unsaturated ester here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl. Oh wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe I have it reversed. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the beta carbon. Let me
