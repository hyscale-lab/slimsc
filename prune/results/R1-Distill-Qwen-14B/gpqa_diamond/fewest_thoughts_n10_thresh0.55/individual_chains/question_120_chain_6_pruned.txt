Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about what's being asked here. The question states that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is at distance d parsecs, its parallax plx is 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Now, assuming uniform distribution of stars, I think that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. If I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr, right? Because the volume of a shell is surface area times thickness, and surface area is 4πd².

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Since plx is 1/d, a change in parallax dplx would correspond to a change in distance. Let's express this. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if I consider a small change in plx, dplx, that would correspond to a change in d. Let me think about how to relate dr and dplx.

Differentiating both sides, d = 1/plx → differentiating both sides with respect to plx. So, dr/dd = -1/(plx)^2. Wait, that's the derivative of d with respect to plx. So, a change in plx, dplx, would lead to a change in d, dr = (dr/dd) * dplx = (-1/(plx)^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, which makes sense.

But since I'm considering a small shell at distance d with thickness dr, the corresponding thickness in plx would be dplx. So, the volume of the shell in terms of plx would be 4πd² dr. But we can express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So d squared is 1/(plx)^2. So the volume becomes 4π*(1/(plx)^2) * dr.
