Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature.

So, since both stars are black bodies, their luminosities depend on R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait no, wait. Because if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. But wait, what about redshift? Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So if it's moving away from us, there's a redshift. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted one.

Oh! Oh right, because the stars may be moving relative to us, their observed wavelengths would be different. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both. So their emitted lambda_max's must account for any Doppler shift.

Wait, let's think. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so there's no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving away at 700
