Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet tugs the star, it makes the star move a little, and we can see that as a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The problem gives the shifts in their spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the planet's mass and other parameters is something like K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/1) ). Oh wait, maybe I should think about the formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * P ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) Wait, perhaps I should look it up. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * 2π ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach: The RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, the inclination angle (but if they're edge-on, which is the best case, sin i is 1). Since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have the same mass, and the inclination might be assumed to be the same (or not given, so perhaps we assume same i for both? Or maybe the problem doesn't require it because it's not given, so perhaps it's the same for both.)

Wait, but the problem says that the stars have the same masses, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, but no info on the inclinations. Hmm, but since the problem gives us the observed shifts (so K), maybe we can relate K for each planet.

The formula for K is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(something). Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as K proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe that's not right. Let's think again.

Another approach: the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (27 * π * G) / (8 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P/(1 day)) )^(-1/3)

But maybe I should find the relation between K, P, and other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the dependence of K on P. Let's consider that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, if M_p and M_star are similar for both planets (since both stars are Sun-like and both planets are Neptune-like), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3).

Wait, so if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. But wait, the question is about the periods. So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K^3)^(1).

Wait, let me think. Let's say K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3). So higher K would mean smaller P. So if K2 is bigger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. But the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's less than 1x, but the options don't have that.

Wait, wait, confusion. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for K is K = ( v ) = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, that might not be right. Maybe the correct formula is K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (2π / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Because when M_p << M_star, which is the case here (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so M_p/(M_star)^(2/3) would be part of the proportionality. And then 1/P^(1/3) is also a factor.

So for both planets, M_p is same, M_star same, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3).

So if K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, then:

K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4

But K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so 1/P2^(1/3) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = P1^(1/3)/P2^(1/3) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) = K1/K2.

Wait, let me write it as:

K1 = (some constant) / P1^(1/3)

K2 = same constant / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So we have K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We can solve for P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 = (P2/P1)

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. Which means that P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is same as P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1? Wait, no. Wait, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So how many times longer is it? It's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.36.

Wait, so the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter, so the number of times is 0.36. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the proportionality.

So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So higher K would mean shorter period.

So if P2 is the period we're comparing, and K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

Which would make the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Dividing the two, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's shorter by that factor.

The question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the factor is less than 1, like 0.36 times. So the answer is option A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method shows that \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), meaning the semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. 

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1,
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2,

we can write the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 \) and \( P_1 \) is related to the inverse cube of the semi-amplitude ratio:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter by this factor. The question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), so the answer is approximately 0.36.
