Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau, the proper lifetime? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh, but Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert units properly.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute the proper lifetime tau using tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Compute the Lorentz factor gamma using gamma = E / (m c²). Wait, but E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But here, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So
