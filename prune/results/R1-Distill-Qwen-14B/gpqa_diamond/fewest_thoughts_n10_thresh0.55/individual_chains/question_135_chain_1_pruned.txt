Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.

First, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ̄_f(y). Wait, no, that's probably a typo or something. Oh wait, maybe it's more like a Yukawa coupling term. The standard form is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So the interaction would allow X to couple to fermions, meaning they can annihilate or create fermion pairs.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f̄ to be allowed, the sum of the masses of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², the available energy has to be enough to create the particles.

Now, I need to recall the masses of all the fermions. Let me list them:

- Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Quarks:
   up (u): ~0.003 GeV (current quark mass)
   down (d): ~0.004 GeV
   strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
   charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
   bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
   top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. Wait, the fermion masses in the Lagrangian are their rest masses. So for X to decay into f f̄, the combined mass of f and f̄ must be less than or equal to X's mass.

So X is 6 GeV. Let's see each possibility:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−

Wait, the b quark is about 4 GeV, so 2*4.13 is about 8.26 GeV. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Because X is only 6 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into b quarks? Let me calculate: 2*m_b = 2 * 4.13 ≈ 8.26 GeV. That's way above 6 GeV, so decay into b quarks is not allowed, right? So option A includes b b̄, which is not possible.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Check each:

c c̄: 2 * 1.27 ≈ 2.54 Ge
