Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that stability constants are involved in the formation of complexes. Each beta represents the formation constant for a complex with a certain number of thiocyanate ligands. So, for Co(SCN)_n^2- or something like that.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^{2−n} or something similar. So, the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^{+}, since Co is +2, SCN is -1, so one SCN would make it [Co(SCN)]^+. But wait, the charge would be +2 + (-1) = +1. So the formula would be [Co(SCN)]^+.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The general formula for the nth complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}. Because each SCN is -1, and Co is +2. So for n=1, the charge is 2 - 1 = +1. For n=2, 2-2=0. For n=3, 2-3= -1. For n=4, 2-4= -2.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, so that's the β2 complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex
