Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. When the planet tugs the star, it makes the star move towards or away from us, which shifts the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the masses of the stars and the planets are similar to the Sun and Neptune respectively. Both planets are detected via RV, and we're given the periodic shifts in their spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity towards/away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/1)}, but wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_* ))^(1/3)} multiplied by (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ) or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (P^2) * (a^3) = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)), but since M_p << M_*, it simplifies to P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_*). So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (sqrt(M_*)).

But wait, the RV method gives us K, the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) /
