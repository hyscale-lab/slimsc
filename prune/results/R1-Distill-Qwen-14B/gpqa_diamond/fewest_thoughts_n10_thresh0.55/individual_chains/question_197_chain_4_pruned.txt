Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and there are four options to choose from.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data to determine what Compound X is. Then, I can figure out what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, which I remember are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes, right? So if Compound X has a ketone group, that might be relevant.

Let me look at the IR data first.

IR peaks:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad region suggests either O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe N-H or other. But in this case, since it's in a larger range, perhaps it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe an alkyne C-H stretch, but those are usually around 3300-2200, but this is a broad peak, so more likely O-H.
Wait, wait, wait. The 3400–2500 is a broad region, but looking at the specific peaks: 1720 cm-1 and others.

1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a little higher. Esters also have carbonyls around 1720-1740. So that suggests a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data to see what's going on.

1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This is a broad singlet, which is a strong indication of an O-H proton. Typically, for a carboxylic acid's -OH, it's around 10-12 ppm. So that's a clue.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Ar protons, probably para-substituted because the two protons are a doublet.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, probably para to the first set. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, for example, a substituent in position 4, maybe a substituent with an electron-withdrawing group because the protons are deshielded (higher ppm).
Wait, wait. Let me think: Benzene rings, when substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, cause the ortho and para protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. So if the substituent is at position 1, the para protons would be at position 4. But in NMR, the substituent's position affects the chemical shifts of adjacent protons.

Wait, wait, the 8.0 ppm is
