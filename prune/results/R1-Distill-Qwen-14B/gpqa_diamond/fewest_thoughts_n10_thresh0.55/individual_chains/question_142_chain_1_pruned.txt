Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than a pure state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. I remember that for a qubit, the Pauli matrices are involved in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere if it's a single qubit state.

So, the general form of a density matrix for a single qubit state is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3-dimensional vector (the Bloch vector). The components of r correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. 

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. I know that |0⟩⟨0| is a projector and |1⟩⟨1| is another. Adding them together gives a matrix where the diagonal elements are 1/2 each because |0⟩⟨0| has 1 on the (1,1) position, and same for |1⟩⟨1|. So the diagonal is [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2], but wait, no, wait a second. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. Let me write out (I + r·σ)/2. The I matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the σ·r part would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So r·σ would be [[r_z, r_x - i r_y],[r_x + i r_y, -r_z]]. Multiplying this by 1/2 and adding 1/2 I would give:

( (1 + r_z)/2 , ... )

Wait, no, wait. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So when you expand, each diagonal element is (1 + r_z)/2 for (1,1) and (1 - r_z)/2 for (2,2). Because the (1,1) element of r·σ is r_z, so when you add I, it's 1 + r_z. Then divided by 2.

In our given ρ, the diagonal elements are 1/2. So, (1 + r_z)/2 =
