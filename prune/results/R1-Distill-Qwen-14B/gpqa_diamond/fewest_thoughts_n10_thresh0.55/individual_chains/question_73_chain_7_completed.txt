Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, calculating speeds isn't just a simple addition like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the problem says their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and speed 0.6c, the second has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Oh wait, but wait, when calculating relative speed, I think it's from the perspective of one astronaut looking at the other.

I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame and object B is moving at v relative to the lab, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Because A is moving at u, so B's speed from A's frame is v minus u, but you have to account for the relativity of simultaneity and the contraction, so the denominator comes in.

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, right? So astronaut A (2m, 0.6c) would see astronaut B, who is moving at 0.5c, so from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate that. The numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is positive, so 0.14c. Oh wait, but I should double-check the formula. Does it matter which order I subtract? Because if I'm calculating the speed of B from A's frame, it's (v - u), where u is A's speed in the lab frame, and v is B's speed in lab frame. So yeah, 0.5c - 0.6c is negative, so B is moving slower than A, so from A's perspective, B is moving in the opposite direction. But the problem is asking for relative speed, which is a magnitude, so 0.14c.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which matches option C and D. Now, what about the total energy?

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both astronauts.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). v is 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36.

So gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So m1 is 2m, m2 is 3m. So for the second astronaut, v is 0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. So gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So option C's E matches.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, E is approximately 5.96 mc², which is option C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for gamma2. Let's compute it accurately. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (sqrt(3))/2 ≈0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So yes, gamma2 is approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c². E1 is 2.5 m c². Summing them gives 5.964, which is approximately 5.96. So the E in option C is 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and E is ~5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(v_A = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \(v_B = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
- Mass \(m_1 = 2m\),
- Speed \(v_1 = 0.6c\).

Calculate \(\gamma_1\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

Energy \(E_1\):
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
- Mass \(m_2 = 3m\),
- Speed \(v_2 = 0.5c\).

Calculate \(\gamma_2\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy \(E_2\):
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
