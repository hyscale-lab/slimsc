Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li typically has 3 protons, but wait, the mass number here would be 6 because 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Oh right, so it's Li-6.

So the first thing I think I need to do is figure out the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. I think the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is about 6 times the mass of a proton, but wait, actually, the mass isn't exactly 6 protons because neutrons have slightly different masses. Oh, but for heavy ions, the mass is roughly around the atomic mass. Let me think, I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the mass can be found using the formula where the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Let's say each neutron and proton contributes approximately 1 u. But wait, more accurately, a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 

Total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = let's calculate that. 

3 * 1.007276 is 3.021828, and 3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995. Adding them together gives 6.047823 u. So the total rest mass is approximately 6.047823 u.

But wait, sometimes in these problems, people use the atomic mass, which includes electrons. But since we're talking about a nucleus, maybe we should subtract the electrons. Wait, Li-6 has 3 electrons normally, so the atomic mass would be the mass of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons. Wait, but the question is about the nucleus, so its rest mass would be the sum of protons and neutrons minus binding energy, but I think they just want me to
