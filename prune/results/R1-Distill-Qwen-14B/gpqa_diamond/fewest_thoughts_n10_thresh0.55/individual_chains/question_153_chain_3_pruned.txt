Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion, right? Let me try to break down the problem.

The question gives three reactions labeled A, B, and C, and asks what the reactants and major products are. The options are a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it's deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It has two ester groups and a central carbon where the enolate can form. The enolate would be at the alpha position (the central carbon) of the malonate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the attack would be on the less substituted carbon since the (E) configuration has the substituents on opposite sides. Wait, in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents are on the same side? No, wait, E is opposite. So the structure would be CH2-C-O with the p-tolyl group on the same side as the ester? Or opposite? Hmm, maybe that's not the main point. What matters is that the enolate adds to the beta carbon.

So when the enolate attacks the acrylate, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond. The product should have the malonate's R groups attached to the acrylate's chain. Since we're adding the enolate to the beta position, the product would be a longer chain with the substituents from both reactants.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. So the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituents in E configuration. So when the enolate attacks, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the beta carbon) would get the malonate's group.

After the attack, the product would be an addition across the double bond. Since the starting acrylate is (E), the substituents would be on opposite sides. But after the addition, the product would have the two ester groups from the malonate attached.

Wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. Its enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. Attacking the beta carbon of the acrylate (which is CH2 in CH2=CH-CO-OCH3), so the product would be CH2(COOCH3)2 added to CH2, making a
