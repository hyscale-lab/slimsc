Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating with excess KOH, which gives product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each face being a cyclohexane ring. The 1,3-dibromo suggests that the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the structure.

Heating this with KOH in excess – I think that's an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it would likely deprotonate and cause elimination. Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two equivalents of HBr, it should form an alkene. Wait, but where would the double bond form? Since the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3), elimination would lead to a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or perhaps between 2 and 3? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane – so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are two apart (like on a cyclohexane ring). So the structure would be Br-C-C-Br in a ring. When KOH is used, it should abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons that were formerly bearing Br. So the product would be a diene? Or perhaps an alkene.

Wait, maybe it's more about forming an epoxide? No, KOH typically isn't used for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to
