Okay, so I have this astronomy question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question gives me information about both spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars that are 17 mag or lower because lower magnitudes are brighter. HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So, a star must be brighter than 16 mag (so, mag ≤16) to be seen by both. Because if a star is fainter than 16, say 17, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent magnitude (V) needs to be ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's ≤16. Because if a star is brighter than 16 mag (so, lower magnitude number), both can observe it. Wait, wait, no—if the apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, that means m_v ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_v ≤16. So for a star to be observable by both, m_v must be ≤16. Because if a star is brighter than 16, both can see it. If a star is fainter than 16 but brighter than 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So the stars that can be detected by both must have m_v ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes. Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is given for some stars. For others, we have to calculate it using distance and absolute magnitude, considering extinction (dust) for those that have E(B-V) given.

Let me list each star and determine if it can be observed by both.

Star1: Absolute V mag of 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent mag m1 = M + 5 log10 (d/10) = 15.5 +5*(1) =20.5. Oh
