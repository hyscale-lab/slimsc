Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually an addition reaction. Oh wait, right, it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in a basic condition, I think. But wait, the product here is a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

Wait, how does that work? The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a negative charge which would pick up a proton. But wait, what's the condition for that? I remember that the reaction typically uses an acid. Because the mechanism involves the formation of an oxonium ion. So, to protonate the oxygen, you need an acid. So, reagent A in the first reaction must be an acid, like H3O+ or maybe something else.

Looking at the options, in the first part (A), options A and B have H3O+ as reagent A. Options C and D have NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Oh, right, sodium bisulfite is often used in the formation of bisulfite adducts, like in the identification of carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure about its role in this reaction. Alternatively, is it a source of H+ ions?

So, in the formation of a cyanohydrin, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. The cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but without acid, the reaction might not proceed efficiently because the carbonyl needs to be activated. So, adding H3O+ would provide the necessary protons.

So for the first reaction, A is likely H3O+. That points to options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, but the reagent listed is B, which is H2O? Or is reagent B something else along with H2O?

Wait, the question says: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So maybe B is an acid? Like HCl or CH3COOH. Because I'm thinking of the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The product here is a carboxylic acid, so likely it's the acidic hydrolysis. The typical conditions for converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid involve strong acid, heat, and water. So, for example, using HCl (concentrated) as a catalyst.

Wait, but in the reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but in the second case, it's a substituted version.

Wait, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is a nitrile attached to a carbon that's also bearing a hydroxyl group and a (4-benzylphenyl) group. So, when this is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile group converts to a carboxylic acid, meaning the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis.

Under what conditions does that happen? It's typically done with strong acid, like HCl, or strong base. But since the product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely to form under acidic conditions, the reagent B would be HCl. Wait, but the reagent is H2O and B. So I think B is the acid catalyst. So, in the second reaction, B is HCl.

Looking back at the options, for the second reaction, reagent B must be HCl or something else.

So, the first reaction uses A as H3O+ (so options A or B), and the second reaction uses B as HCl (so options A or C or D, depending on what B is).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So for the first part, we thought A is H3O+, so options A and B. For the second reaction, B is HCl, so options A and C.

If the first requires H3O+ and the second HCl, then the correct option would be A (option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl).

But wait, let me think again. Could there be another possibility for the first reaction? For the cyanohydrin formation, sometimes the reaction is done in a basic solution. Wait, but I thought it needed acid. Let me double-check. The cyanohydrin reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the addition of H+ to the carbonyl oxygen makes it a better leaving group. Without acid, the reaction is slower or may not proceed. So yes, H3O+ is needed as A.

So, the second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. The conditions are typically aqueous acid, like HCl. So when B is HCl, that makes sense.

So, the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires acidic conditions to activate the carbonyl group, allowing the cyanide ion to attack and form the product. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary protons to facilitate the reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process is commonly carried out under acidic conditions, with HCl as the catalyst. The product, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, confirms that the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid, which aligns with the use of HCl as the reagent.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ for the first reaction and B = HCl for the second reaction. This matches option A.

Answer: A
