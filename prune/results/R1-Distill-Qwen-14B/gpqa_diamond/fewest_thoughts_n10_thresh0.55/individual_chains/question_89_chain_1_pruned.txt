Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction. That's probably an E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since KOH is a base, it should deprotonate and form a double bond by removing the two adjacent bromine atoms. 

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an adamantene with a double bond. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so removing two bromines from 1,3 positions would create a double bond between C1 and C2 or something like that? Hmm, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh right, the reaction of dibromides with KOH can sometimes give epoxides, but that's more when there's an adjacent dihalide and the base is like aqueous. Wait, no, in this case, it's KOH which is a strong base. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So, the product after KOH is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar, but wait, the structure of adamantane is such that the double bond would be within the diamondoid framework. 

Wait, maybe the product is actually a diol? No, because KOH and heat would more likely cause elimination, not substitution. So, the product is an alkene. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four bridged cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in some way. So, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. So the product after KOH would be 1,3-diene, but that seems unlikely because the structure is a diamondoid. Alternatively, perhaps it's an internal olefin, so the product would be an adamantene with a double bond. 

Then, the NMR spectrum of product 1 is provided. Let's look at the data: 4.79 (2H), 2.
