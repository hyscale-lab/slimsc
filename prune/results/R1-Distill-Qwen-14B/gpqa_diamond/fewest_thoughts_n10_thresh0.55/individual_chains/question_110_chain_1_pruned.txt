Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the key points given. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, any star with an apparent magnitude better (i.e., smaller number) than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and those brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES.

Now, the question is about which stars can be detected by both instruments. So, I need to find stars that are bright enough in V magnitude for both. But wait, HIRES's limit is brighter than 16, which is a stricter condition than ESPRESSO's 17. So, any star that's within HIRES's limit (<=16) will automatically be within ESPRESSO's limit (since 16 is brighter than 17). So the stars that can be seen by both are those that are brighter than 16 V mag. But wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so a star with V=16.5 is within ESPRESSO's capability (since 16.5 <17), but not within HIRES's (since it's 16.5 >16). Hmm, I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO, meaning m_V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe m_V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's m_V <16, then it's automatically <17, so ESPRESSO can see it, and HIRES can too. So the stars that have apparent V magnitude less than 16 can be seen by both.

But wait, looking at the stars:

Star1: absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10 pc, so log(d/10)=0. So m=15.5. So m=15.5. That's less than 16, so HIRES can see it. Also, less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's above 16. HIRES can't see it (since it's brighter than 16, which is the limit; wait, wait, the limit is brighter than 16, so m <16. So a star with m=16.5 is dimmer than 16, so it's beyond HIRES's limit. So Star2 can't be seen by HIRES, but can be seen by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B
