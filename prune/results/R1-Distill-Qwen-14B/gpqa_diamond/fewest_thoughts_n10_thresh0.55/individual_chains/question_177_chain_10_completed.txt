Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but mass might not directly affect luminosity unless it's about something like the star's life cycle or other factors, but the problem mentions they radiate as black bodies. Oh right, so luminosity for black bodies depends on radius and temperature.

The question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember from the blackbody radiation curve that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature of the object. The formula I think is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If their λ_max is the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same.

Wait, but wait. Because if λ_max is same for both stars, that would mean T1 = T2. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait no, let me think again. Oh right, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the peak emission wavelength is the same for both. So using Wien's law, since λ_max is same, T must be same for both stars. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, does that make sense? Because if both stars have the same temperature, then their luminosities would depend on their radii. Because luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So if R and T are same, their L would be same. But wait, in this problem, R is different. So let's see.

Wait, the problem says that Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. Oh, wait, no. Wait, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

If T1 = T2, then L1 / L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, the (T ratio) is 1, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be ~2.25, right? So option A.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, it's 2.25. So the answer would be A.

But wait, why are the velocities given? The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, does that affect anything? Hmm. Wait, maybe that's about redshift or blueshift, but if the velocities are along the line of sight, that would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler effect. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps this accounts for any Doppler shift.

Wait, so if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. So the actual emitted wavelength is different, but the observed is same as Star_1. Hmm. Oh because if Star_2 is moving towards us (if radial velocity is positive, maybe it's moving towards us?), its emission would be blueshifted. Wait, but the given radial velocities are Star_1: 0, Star_2: 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is often given as positive for moving away (like recessional velocity). So Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning moving away from us. So its light would be redshifted.

But wait, the peak wavelength observed is same for both. So maybe the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear same. So we need to correct for that.

Hmm, this could complicate things. Let me think again. The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So, the actual emitted wavelengths would be different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. So the temperatures calculated would be the observed temperatures, but the actual temperatures of the stars could be different.

Wait, but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity..." So perhaps in their calculation, they accounted for the Doppler shift. Or maybe they are considering the intrinsic properties. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (as per the star's rest frame) are different because of the Doppler effect. So when they calculate luminosity, they use the actual radius and temperature, not the observed. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's lay out what we know:

- R1 = 1.5 R2.

- M1 = 1.5 M2. But M might not be relevant here because we're using blackbody radiation, which depends on R and T.

- Observed λ_max is same for both stars. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But the stars might be moving, so their emitted λ_max (in their rest frame) could be different. Because of Doppler shift, if a star is moving towards us, its emitted λ is blueshifted, so observed λ is shorter. If it's moving away, λ is redshifted.

So the stars' actual λ_max (in their rest frame) might be different, but due to their velocities, the observed λ_max is same.

So we can think that: the observed λ_max is same, but the actual λ_max (emitted) is different. Because of their velocities.

So, using Doppler shift formula: λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for v << c, this approximates to λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). Wait, but wait, for recessional velocity (v away), the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + v/c). But that's when v is much less than c.

But let's think about the relation between observed λ and the star's velocity.

For Star_1, v1 = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s, moving away. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem says that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, so λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

Putting it together: (b / T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b, get 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So, the temperatures are different. So, T1 is less than T2. Because as Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, implying that its emitted λ is shorter (since λ_obs is longer), so T2 is higher because λ is shorter for higher T.

Wait, let me clarify. If Star_2's λ_emit is shorter, then T2 is higher. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So T2 = b / λ2_emit, and T1 = b / λ1_emit.

So, if λ2_emit is smaller than λ1_emit (since Star_2 is moving away, making its observed λ longer, but its emitted is shorter), then T2 is higher than T1.

Hmm, perhaps I should plug in the numbers.

Wait, let's compute the Doppler factor. v2 is 700 km/s. Let's find v2/c.

The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333. So v2/c ≈ 0.02333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So, λ_obs = λ_emit * 1.02333.

But since λ_obs is same for both stars, λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ1_emit = λ2_obs / (1.02333) → λ1_emit ≈ λ2_emit * 0.977.

But λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_emit = 0.977 * λ2_emit → T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ T2 * 1.0233.

So T1 is about 2.33% higher than T2.

Wait, that's interesting. So even though λ_obs is same, the actual temperatures of the stars are different because of their velocities.

Wait, but wait. So for Star_1, which has v=0, λ1_emit = λ_obs. So T1 = b / λ1_emit.

For Star_2, λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c ), so T2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (b λ_obs )^{-1} * (1 + v2/c) ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) )

Because T1 = b / λ_obs, so λ_obs = b / T1.

So T2 = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

Wait, no, let me recheck that.

Wait, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c ), assuming v is positive when moving away.

So λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c). So T2 = b / λ_emit = b / (λ_obs/(1 + v/c)) ) = (b λ_obs)/(1 + v/c )^{-1} )

Wait, no, T = b / λ_emit.

Since λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c ), then T2 = b / (λ_obs/(1 + v/c )) ) = (b (1 + v/c )) / λ_obs.

But T1 = b / λ_obs.

So T2 = (1 + v/c ) * T1.

So T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c ) ≈ 1.0233.

So now, with that, the temperatures are different. So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c ), so T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c ) ≈ 1 / 1.0233 ≈ 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4 ≈ let me calculate that.

0.977^2 is about 0.9545. Then squared again: (0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.911.

So putting it all together, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.059.

Wait, that's about 2.06. But none of the options are that low. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.977)^4.

Let me compute it more precisely.

0.977^4.

First, 0.977^2: 0.977 * 0.977.

Let me calculate:

977 * 977:

Well, 977^2 = (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000000 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1e6 -46000 + 529 = 954529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, 0.954529^2 = ?

Compute 954529 * 954529, but let's approximate:

0.954529 * 0.954529 ≈ (0.95)^2 = 0.9025, but more accurately.

Let me compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Let me compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

0.95 * 0.0045 = 0.004275.

0.0045 * 0.95 = 0.004275.

0.0045 * 0.0045 = 0.00002025.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Let me compute 954529 * 954529.

Wait, perhaps I should just use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (0.9545)^2.

0.9545 * 0.9545:

= (0.9 + 0.0545)^2

= 0.9^2 + 2*(0.9)*(0.0545) + 0.0545^2

= 0.81 + 2*(0.04905) + 0.00297025

= 0.81 + 0.0981 + 0.00297025

= 0.81 + 0.0981 = 0.9081; 0.9081 + 0.00297025 = 0.91107025.

So 0.9545^2 ≈ 0.91107, which is approximately 0.911.

So (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.059.

That's approximately 2.06, but none of the options are that. Hmm. The options are all around 2.23 to 2.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So the Doppler shift is positive for Star_2, making its observed wavelength longer. Therefore, the emitted wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature.

Wait, but the way I applied it earlier, I think I may have confused the formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

But when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so v is positive. So Star_2's λ_obs is same as Star_1's λ_obs, which is λ1_rest.

Wait, but Star_1's λ_obs is λ1_rest because its v is zero.

So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c )

But λ is inversely proportional to T. So:

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * (1 + v2/c ) / λ1_rest = (1 + v2/c ) * (b / λ1_rest ) ) = (1 + v2/c ) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Star_2's rest λ is λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c )

Because Star_2 is moving away, so observed λ is longer.

So T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * (1 + v2/c ) / λ1_rest.

But T1 is b / λ1_rest.

So T2 = (1 + v2/c ) * (b / λ1_rest ) ) = (1 + v2/c ) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Ah, so that would make T2 higher than T1, which makes sense, because Star_2 is moving away, making its observed λ longer, so its emitted λ is shorter, so higher temperature.

So earlier, I thought the opposite, but now it's clear.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

But wait, that would mean T2 is greater than T1.

Wait, but then, when I compute L1 and L2:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (1 / (1 + v2/c ))^4.

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1/(1 + v2/c ))^4.

Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Earlier I thought L1/L2 = (R1²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ), but that's correct.

So now, substituting the numbers.

v2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + v2/c ) = approx 1.02333.

So (1/(1.02333 ))^4.

Let me compute 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

0.977^4.

Wait, earlier I found 0.977^4 ≈ 0.911.

So 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.059 → about 2.06.

But the options are 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Hmm, this suggests that the factor is about 2.06, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm handling the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately without approximations.

Let me compute (1 + v2/c ) exactly.

v2 = 700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333333...

So (1 + v/c ) = 1.0023333333...

So 1/(1 + v/c ) = 1 / 1.0023333333 ≈ ?

Calculating reciprocal:

1.0023333333 is approximately 1.002333.

So 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997674.

Because 1.002333 * 0.997674 ≈ 1.

So 0.997674^4 is approximately:

Compute 0.997674^2 = (approx 0.995356).

Then square that: 0.995356^2 ≈ 0.990735.

So (1/(1 + v/c ))^4 ≈ 0.990735.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990735 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990735.

Calculating that:

2.25 * 0.990735 = ?

Well, 2 * 0.990735 = 1.98147,

0.25 * 0.990735 = 0.24768375,

Adding them together: 1.98147 + 0.24768375 ≈ 2.22915.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23. 

So looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Ah, so that's the correct factor. So the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and the relationships for blackbody radiation.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 \, M_2 \) (not directly relevant for luminosity calculation)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   - Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).

3. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - Luminosity of a blackbody: 
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
     \]

4. **Temperature Relationship**:
   - From Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature: \( \lambda \propto \frac{1}{T} \).
   - Since the observed wavelengths are the same, the Doppler shift must be accounted for. Using the Doppler formula:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), this simplifies to:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1 + v/c)
     \]
   - For Star_2, moving away with \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), its emitted wavelength is shorter than its observed wavelength. Thus:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs,2}}}{1 + v_2/c}
     \]
   - Using \( \lambda \propto 1/T \), the temperature ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}
     \]
     Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997674
     \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
     \]
     Using \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.997674 \), we calculate:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.997674)^4 \approx 0.990735
     \]
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.990735 \approx 2.229
     \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. The closest option is **D) ~2.23**.

Answer: D
