Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution would be (original volume * original concentration) / total volume.

So that would be (20.00 cm³ * 0.05 M) / (40.00 cm³) = (1.00 mmol) / (40 mL) = 0.025 M. Wait, 20 mL is 0.02 L, right? Let me double-check that. Oh, no, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but when diluted, the total is 40 cm³ which is 0.04 L.

So the concentration after dilution is (0.02 L * 0.05 M) / 0.04 L = (0.001 moles) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So at 25% titration, we've added a quarter of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. I need to find the pH at that point and also at the equivalence point.

Wait, first, I should find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

The moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So the equivalence point volume is 10 mL of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH.

Hmm, but wait, when doing titration calculations, it's important to consider the buffer solution formed before the equivalence point. At 25% titration, we're adding a quarter of the NaOH needed, so we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base.

So, let's compute the moles of acetic acid and acetate ion at this point.

Initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 2.5 mL * 0.1 M = 0.25 mmol. Wait, because 2.5 mL is 0.0025 L, so 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol. Oh wait, yeah, because 0.1 M is 0.1 mol per liter, so 2.5 mL is 0.002
