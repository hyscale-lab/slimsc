Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are A to D, each giving a vector r with three components.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states). But wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, I think I've heard about the Bloch sphere representation for qubits. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of qubit states, where each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state.

So the density matrix can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere. The standard basis for this representation is the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space (the Bloch vector). The components of r correspond to the expectation values with the Pauli matrices.

Let's break down the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projection operator, and same with |1⟩⟨1|. So adding them gives the identity matrix because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal. Oh wait, no, because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is indeed the identity matrix for a single qubit. So ρ would be (I)/2, right?

Wait, but I thought the identity matrix is 2x2. So when you take (I)/2, each diagonal element would be 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2]. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, meaning it's equally likely to be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩. So this is the maximally mixed state.

Now, how does this correspond to the Bloch vector r? I remember that for a density matrix ρ, you can write it as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So when you expand this, you can compare it to the given ρ to find the components of r.

Given that ρ is (I)/2, that implies that the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are all zero. Because if you have (I + 0 + 0 + 0)/2, that's just I/2.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Because r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, not on the surface. So the vector r is at the origin.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, which is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by the vector \((0, 0, 0)\). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
