Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, but |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Oh right, so they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. So, the state is a linear combination of these two.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because when you have a state vector, you have to make sure its norm is 1. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). Its magnitude squared is |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So adding them together, 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since we have two eigenstates. Let me write this matrix.

Since |up> and |down> are the basis, the matrix would be in that basis. The diagonal elements are zero (because when i=j, A_ij is zero), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0  ]

Wait, is that correct? Because i and j are the row and column indices. So for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, the elements are hbar/2. So yeah
