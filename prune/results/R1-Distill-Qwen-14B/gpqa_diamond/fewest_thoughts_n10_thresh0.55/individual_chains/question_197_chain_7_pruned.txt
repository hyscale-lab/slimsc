Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, mostly substituted benzoic acids and benzene derivatives.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks present are in the ranges: 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, the 3400-2500 region is a broad area, which usually suggests O-H or N-H stretching. But considering the other peaks, maybe it's an O-H stretch? The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong one, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad and strong, maybe around 2500-3300. Oh, but the IR here shows a broad peak from 3400 to 2500, which might include an O-H stretch. So maybe compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. So that supports the idea of an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's quite upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, more likely, that's an O-H proton from a carboxylic acid. Because aromatic protons are usually around 7-8.5 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but the integration here is 1H, and a broad peak suggests exchange, which is typical for a carboxylic O-H. So that's probably from a COOH group.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents causing splitting. Let's think about this. Two doublets, each integrating 2H, suggests a para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons on either substituent are split into doublets. For example, if there are two substituents on opposite ends, like in p-xylene, but in this case, the substituents might be a group and a COOH group.

Wait, but looking at the integration, 2H each, so four aromatic protons. So the molecule is a monosubstituted benzene? No, wait, if the H's are in two doublets each of two H, that's four H. For a benzene ring, that suggests perhaps a
