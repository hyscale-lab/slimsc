Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on. Let me see if I can work through it.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between atoms along the lattice vectors, right? So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles...? Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is just a divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l²). But rhombohedral is not cubic. So the formula must be a bit different. Oh right! For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance formula involves the Miller indices and the angles between the lattice vectors.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α
