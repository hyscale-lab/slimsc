Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, I need to figure out how to make that from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-Câ‰¡CH.

The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. That means on the cyclohexane ring, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Also, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's a cyclohexane ring connected to a CH(OH)CH2 group, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a -CH2-CHO group? Or wait, maybe it's cyclohexane with a CHO group attached directly. I think it's the latter because it's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no, carbaldehyde would be -CHO attached directly to the ring. So the main ring has a -CHO group. Then, there's a substituent at the 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde, I suppose), which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main ring.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, so it's like -(cyclohexyl)-CH(OH)-CH2- attached? Wait, maybe I should draw the structure mentally.

Wait, the target molecule's name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydro
