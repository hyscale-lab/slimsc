Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the problem is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, when they look at the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), they notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is spotted. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, which is in the ultraviolet I think. And they assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means each region is at a uniform temperature and the usual Boltzmann equations apply.

Hmm, the first thing I'm trying to remember is how the ratio of populations in two energy levels is determined. I think it has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 is the population of level 2,
- n1 is the population of level 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (or degeneracy) of the levels,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, because the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. Therefore, without spots, the ratio should be higher. So the factor by which the ratio changes (n1/n2) would be higher in the unspotted case compared to the spotted case.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify: the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.

Let me think about the temperatures. Without spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, wait a second. Does the presence of spots lower the overall temperature, but what about the local temperature of the photosphere where the spots are?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Are the spots cooler regions on the star? Yes, because when spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the star drops. So when the spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, but the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So perhaps the star's overall photosphere is now a mix of hotter (unspotted) regions and cooler (spotted
