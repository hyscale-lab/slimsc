Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions, and there are three parts: A, B, and C. Each part has different reactants and conditions, and I need to figure out the products. Then match them with the options provided.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (like an ester or nitrile). The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

So for each part, I need to identify the enolate and the electrophilic component.

Starting with part A: reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2. So it's a di-ester. I think in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate can form an enolate. Since malonate is a good Michael donor, its enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the alpha position. Wait, no, let me think. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-position would be the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-C-(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: The acrylate has a double bond between
