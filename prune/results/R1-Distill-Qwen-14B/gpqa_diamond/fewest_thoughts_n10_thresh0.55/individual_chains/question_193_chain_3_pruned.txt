Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, astronomers have noticed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's asking about the number per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is that distance is equal to 1 divided by the parallax, right? So d = 1/plx. But wait, I think the units are in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away. Oh yeah, so the distance (d) in parsecs is inversely proportional to the parallax (plx) in arcseconds.

So the number of stars (N) varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d.

Let me substitute that into the equation. So N = k / ( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So when you divide by that, it's equivalent to multiplying by d^5. So
