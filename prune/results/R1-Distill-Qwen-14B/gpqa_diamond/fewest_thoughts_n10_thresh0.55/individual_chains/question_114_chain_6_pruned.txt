Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh wait, I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. But wait, no, wait. NaCN is a source of CN⁻, which is a nucleophile. But ketones can't just react with CN⁻ on their own, can they? Or wait, maybe in some specific conditions.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding a cyanide ion might lead to nucleophilic addition. But wait, maybe it's more like a substitution? No, substitution isn't typically how ketones react. Oh wait, wait. Maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, I think that's it! Cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with CN⁻, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol, but wait, no. Wait, no, a cyanohydrin is when the CN adds to the carbonyl group, and the other oxygen becomes an alcohol group. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

So
