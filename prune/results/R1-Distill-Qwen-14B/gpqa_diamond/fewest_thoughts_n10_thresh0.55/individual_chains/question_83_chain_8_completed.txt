Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, its concentration decreases, which should make it less strong, so the pH should be higher than before dilution. Wait, no, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you dilute it, the dissociation increases a bit, but the concentration is lower. Let me think: initially, before any dilution, the concentration is higher, so the pH would be lower. After dilution, the pH should increase a bit, but still acidic.

First, let me figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / (20 +20) = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Right.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point will be when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate the moles first. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 M is 0.025 mol/L, so 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume at equivalence point V_eq is moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question isn't about equivalence yet; it's about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me split this into two parts: 25% titration and equivalence point.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So the volume of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So, after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the solution will consist of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ions. So we can model this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me calculate the concentrations after mixing. Total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.

So, concentrations: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is about 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded, that's about 4.26. So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will have only acetate ions, which will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze as: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is the [OH^-] produced. So [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be negligible).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.516. So pOH = 6 - 0.516 = 5.484. So pH = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516. Rounded, that's about 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach is to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The pH should be determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So the calculation I did should be correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10, yes.

So the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.

Looking back at the options: Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. That matches my calculations.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92, which are lower. Option C says 4.73 and 7.00. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated one of the steps.

Wait, wait, another thought. At the equivalence point, when all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. But acetate is a weak base. So I did the Kb correctly, but perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Let me recalculate Kb and the hydrolysis.

Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

In the hydrolysis, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. Let me set up the expression again.

Kb = x² / (0.02) → x² = 0.02 * Kb = 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. So x is sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let me compute that accurately.

Log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.516 + (-6) → -5.484. So pOH is 5.484, and pH is 14-5.484=8.516. So yes, about 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is approx 8.52.

So the first pH (25%) is around 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check if I did the 25% part correctly. Because sometimes in titration, 25% can be 25% of the equivalence volume. So in this case, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³, which is what I used.

Yes, that's correct. So the 25% titration point is when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait, another approach for the 25% part: perhaps using the initial concentrations and dilution again. Let me recheck.

After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³. Moles of acetic acid: 0.00075, acetate: 0.00025.

So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26.

So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to calculate the 25% titration is using the initial concentrations and dilutions.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can model it in a different way.

Wait, when you add NaOH, it reacts with acetic acid:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So for every mole of NaOH added, a mole of acetic acid is neutralized, and a mole of acetate is formed.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So, at this point, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are as we calculated earlier.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies, leading to pH = pKa + log (n_Acetate / n_Acid) → which is exactly what I did.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact concentrations, considering the dilution.

But I think I did that correctly.

So, the pH at 25% is about 4.26.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26; 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_1 + V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (since \( \text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \)) is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**
