Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, I think we're calculating the electrostatic potential energy here.

Wait, all the charges are 2e each. So, the 13th charge is fixed at P, which I assume is the center where all the other 12 charges are arranged around. The 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P.

So, the setup is like a central charge with 12 others surrounding it at a distance. Now, I'm trying to visualize this. Maybe it's a central charge with 12 others at the same radius. But I'm not sure about the exact configuration, but for potential energy calculations, maybe it's just a matter of considering each pair.

Wait, but wait: Each of the 12 charges is fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the
