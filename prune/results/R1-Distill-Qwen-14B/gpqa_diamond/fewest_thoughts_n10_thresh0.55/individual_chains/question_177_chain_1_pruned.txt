Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits, which depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, from the question, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Mass is also 1.5 times, but I'm not sure if mass matters here because the question is about luminosity, which is more about radius and temperature. Oh wait, unless the mass affects the temperature somehow, but I don't think that's directly given here. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe we can ignore other factors.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Oh, right, because Wien's law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 must equal T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

So, now, let's compute their luminosities. L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same for both stars, the luminosity ratio will be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) → but since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel, so L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²). 

R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1² is (1.5)^2 * R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1/L2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait
