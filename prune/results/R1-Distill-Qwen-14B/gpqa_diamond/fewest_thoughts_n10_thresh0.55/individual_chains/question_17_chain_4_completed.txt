Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. And we need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is probably [CaEDTA]^2-. Right? And the formation constant K, which is given here as 5e10, relates to how strong the complex is.

Wait, but how does that help me find the concentration of Ca²+? Oh, right, because when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, it binds it into a complex which doesn't dissociate much. So the free Ca²+ concentration in solution is going to be really low, especially if K is large.

So the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). But wait, wait, because in solution, when you have the EDTA and Ca²+ mixed, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the initial concentrations are 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, no, wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA are presumably zero? But that can't be, because the complex can dissociate a little bit.

Wait, no, I think I have to consider the dissociation of the complex. So the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the equation:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-

But wait, no, that's the formation equation. The dissociation would be the reverse. So the dissociation constant would be the inverse of K. Wait, so K is the formation constant, so the dissociation constant, Kd, is 1/K. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the dissociation equation is: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The expression for Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA²-] = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So let's assume that at equilibrium, some of it dissociates. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because each complex that dissociates produces one of each ion. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kd is super small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the Kd expression:

(x)(x)/(0.02) = 2e-11

That gives x² = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, what's sqrt(4e-13)? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * (1e-6.5) )= 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Oh wait, so x is about 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So the equation is x²/(0.02) = 2e-11.

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 6.3e-7 is 6.3 x 10^-7, which matches option C. Yep, that's the one.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at ideal pH and 25 °C, we use the dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the inverse of the formation constant \( K \). Given \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the equilibrium concentration of both \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \) M. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
