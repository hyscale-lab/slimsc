Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96c. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. Wait, lithium-6 maybe? Because lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so its mass number is 6. Oh wait, no, because Li normally has 3 neutrons in some isotopes. Wait, let me think. The natural isotope of lithium is Li-7, which has 4 neutrons. Oh, but the question says 3 neutrons. So, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6. Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

Next, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. The energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, the problem is giving the speed v as 0.96c. So I can find gamma using the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Oh right
