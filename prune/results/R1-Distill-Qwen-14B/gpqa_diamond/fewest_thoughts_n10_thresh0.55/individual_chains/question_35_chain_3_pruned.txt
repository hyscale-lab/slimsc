Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me the operator A_y, which is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It says that A_y = c * S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So I should probably write down matrix S first.

Wait, so S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y = c * S. Let me compute that. Multiplying each element by c, so A_y becomes:
[ 0*c   (-i)*c ]
[ (i)*c  0*c ]
Which is:
[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix A_y is:
[ 0        -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0        ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Right, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

Setting up the matrix (A_y - λ I):

[ -λ        (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  -λ       ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating that determinant: (λ²) - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1. So that term becomes (h/(4π))^2 * 1.

So determinant equation: λ² - (h^2/(16 π²)) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, h²/(16 π²) = (h/(4π))². So the square root is h/(4π) because it's positive, but since we have plus and minus, the eigenvalues
