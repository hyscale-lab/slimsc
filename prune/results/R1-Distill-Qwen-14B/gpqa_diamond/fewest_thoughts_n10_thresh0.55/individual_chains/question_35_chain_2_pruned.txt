Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c * S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right?

The matrix S has the first row as 0 and -i, and the second row as i and 0. So S looks like:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. And during this calculation, which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Let me start by recalling some basics. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it'll have two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.

First, let me write out A_y. Since A_y = c * S, and c is h/(4π), substituting that in, A_y becomes:

[ 0    (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, but maybe I can factor out h/(4π) from the matrix. So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

Alternatively, since c is a scalar, it's just scaling each element of S by c. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first, since scaling a matrix by a constant scales its eigenvalues by that same constant.

So let me find the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) because i^2 is -1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² - trace λ + determinant = 0. Since trace is 0, equation becomes λ² - ( -1 ) = 0 → λ² = 1
