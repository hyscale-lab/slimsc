Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that the reaction of ketones with cyanide can form cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source under certain conditions. So butan-2-one reacting with NaCN would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, what's the role of reagent A here?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, adding the CN group. Then, the oxygen would pick up a proton because in the cyanohydrin formation, the oxygen becomes hydroxyl. So after the reaction, we get (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which matches the product 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

How is this cyanohydrin formed? I think that the reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Oh wait, I've heard that HCN is used with a strong acid like H2SO4. But here it's NaCN. So maybe the condition is acidic. Alternatively, sometimes you have the cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile in a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, the reaction conditions for forming cyanohydrins from ketones usually involve an aqueous solution of HCN, but since the reagent here is NaCN, perhaps it's in an acidic aqueous solution. So maybe reagent A is something like H3O+ (proton source) to provide the acidic conditions, allowing the CN- to attack the carbonyl.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the cyanohydrin is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I think that hydrolysis of nitriles can produce carboxylic acids. But what are the conditions for that? I remember that nitriles hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, with something like HCl and heat, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions with strong bases and maybe heat.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. That doesn't make sense by itself. Wait, no, looking back, the problem says that the second reaction
