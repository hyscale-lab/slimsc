Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions in the core stops. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about solar neutrinos and the pp chain.

So the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain, right? I think there are a few branches in the pp chain. The main one is the pp-I branch, then there's pp-II and pp-III. The question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I remember that in the pp chain, protons fuse into deuterons, and then further reactions happen. The pp-I branch involves the capture of a proton on a deuteron to form a triton and a positron, then the triton fuses with a proton to make helium-3. The pp-II branch must be another path where instead of that, two deuterons might fuse or something else happens. And pp-III is another branch, perhaps involving a different reaction pathway.

Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-3 nucleus to form carbon-12. But wait, isn't that a part of the CNO cycle? No, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a different fusion step. Oh right, another possibility is that in the pp-III branch, two helium-3 nuclei combine to form carbon-12. So that would be part of the main pp chain processes.

But the question says that the pp-III
