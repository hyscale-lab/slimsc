Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. The options are four different GeV values, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

First, I need to understand what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3 (protons) and the neutron number is 3, so mass number is 6. So, the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

The problem is about calculating the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in special relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, I also know that the kinetic energy K is E - m0 c². But the question asks for the energy, which I think refers to the total energy, not just the kinetic part. Although, sometimes people use energy and kinetic energy interchangeably in such contexts, but I'll stick to the total energy unless told otherwise.

So, the first step is to find the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Here, v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 equals approximately 1, right? 0.28 * 3.5714 is 1, yes. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0 c². But what's m0 for Li-6? The mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (amu). Wait, I think the exact value might be 6.013 u. One atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the rest mass energy is 6.013 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.013 * 931.5 is approximately 12.1095 MeV. So adding them gives 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.109
