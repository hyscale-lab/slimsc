Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, I remember that transit method is one way to detect planets, right? The idea is that when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. But the question is about probability, so I need to think about how likely each planet is to transit.

The setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster for the same star mass. Wait, but Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, its semi-major axis is smaller. That means it's closer in.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if two stars have same radius but different masses, the more massive one is probably hotter? Or maybe it's a subgiant or something. But for transit probability, I think the key factors are the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital distance, which affects the chance of alignment.

The probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2, or wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, the geometric probability for a transit is actually proportional to (R_s / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star's disk, which has radius R_s. So the chance depends on the ratio of R_s to a. The smaller a is (closer orbit), the higher the probability because the area the planet can transit is larger relative to the star's disk.

Wait, no, I think the formula for transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area that the planet can cover, which is more accurately modeled as the probability that the planet's orbit, as viewed
