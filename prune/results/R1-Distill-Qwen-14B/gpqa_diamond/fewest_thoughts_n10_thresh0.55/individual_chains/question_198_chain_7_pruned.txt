Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, what's the blue one? Oh right, I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN⁻ ions, like [Co(SCN)_2]²+. So that's the second complex with β2=40.

So the problem is about finding the fraction of Co(II) that's in the form [Co(SCN)_2]²+. To find the percentage, I need to look at the distribution of Co in all possible complexes and free ions.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to set up expressions for each complex, considering their stability, and then calculate their contributions.

Let me think about the possible complexes. Co(II) can form different complexes with SCN⁻:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]+ (β1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]²+ (β2)
- [Co(SCN)_3]⁰ (β3)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (β4)
Wait, but wait, the charges: Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So [Co(SCN)] would have charge +1 (since 2+ + (-1) = +1). [Co(SCN)_2] would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Co²+ is +2, each SCN⁻ is -1. So [Co(SCN)] would be +2 + (-1) = +1, so the charge is +1. [Co(SCN)_2] would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0.
