Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's the classical answer, option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that directly.

In relativity, I think energy considerations change because the total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in the spring would still be (1/2)kx², but I think in the relativistic case, the maximum speed isn't just when all potential is converted to kinetic because of how gamma affects things.

Wait, but here the system is a harmonic oscillator. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy in relativity isn't the same as classical. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. So E = gamma * mc².

At maximum speed, the potential energy would be
