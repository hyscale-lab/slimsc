Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with reaction mechanisms, but I'll take it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints and multiple-choice options, so I need to figure out the structure of each compound step by step.

First, the reaction sequence:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

And there are two hints:

a) Compound A reacts with some phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Alright, let's process each part.

From the IR data:

- A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. But considering the reaction paths, I think it's a ketone because aldehydes might react differently with HCN.

- E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1. That's also a carbonyl, but a bit lower. Could be a ketone, but maybe a different environment or maybe an ester? Wait, but considering the reaction steps, E is after some elimination, possibly forming a ketone again.

Now, the first reaction: A + HCN â†’ B.

Hm, what's HCN used for? Oh right, it's a nucleophile. If A is a ketone, HCN might add to the carbonyl, forming an cyanohydrin. Wait, but I think the reaction of a ketone with HCN typically forms a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So, A would be a cyclic ketone, and B would be a cyclo secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

Wait, but I've also heard that HCN
