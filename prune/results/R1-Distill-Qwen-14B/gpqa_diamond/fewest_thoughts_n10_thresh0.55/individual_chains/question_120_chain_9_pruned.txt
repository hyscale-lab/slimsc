Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me think through this step by step. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that the distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (plx in arcseconds). So distance d = 1 / plx. 

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So when parallax increases, the distance decreases because d = 1/plx. So if I have a certain volume of space, how many stars are there in a shell at a certain distance?

I remember that the number of stars in a spherical shell depends on the volume. The volume of a thin shell between distance d and d+Δd would be approximately 4πd²Δd. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's say the number density is n. So the number of stars in the shell is n * 4πd²Δd.

But the question is in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, we can write d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So substituting that into the volume, the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx)^2 * Δd. But wait, Δd is the change in distance, which relates to the change in parallax. Let me think about how Δplx relates to Δd. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative of both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, Δd ≈ -(1/plx²) Δplx. But since Δd is positive (as we move outward), Δplx would be negative, so maybe we can write Δd = (1/plx²) Δplx, but perhaps the negative sign just indicates direction, and for the magnitude it's okay to take absolute values.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx. Let's say I have a range of plx from plx to plx + Δplx. What's the corresponding distance range? The distance for plx is d = 1/pl
