Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which I think is in the near UV or maybe the blue part of the spectrum. 

Wait, but the problem is about how the ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when there are spots, so the ratio without spots must be higher than with spots. We need to find the factor by which it changes. 

Hmm, so first, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of different energy levels in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, when the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When it has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, does the photospheric temperature change uniformly? Oh wait, the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is the same. Hmm, but the problem says that when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the model here is that the star's overall emitted flux is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. 

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe we're to consider the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines form. Or perhaps the question is simpl
