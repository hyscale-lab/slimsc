Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reaction steps and the given hints. Let's start by breaking down each step and the information provided.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Then, the hints:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR has a peak at ~1715 cm^-1.

I remember that IR peaks around 1750 are usually for carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes. But wait, the peak for E is 1715, which is a bit lower. Maybe E is an ester or another carbonyl compound.

Looking at the reaction steps:

First, A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So if A has a carbonyl, like a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN gives cyclohexane cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Next, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So perhaps the nitrile group in B (from HCN addition) would be reduced. Wait, but wait. HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a -CN group adjacent. Reducing that with H2 and Pd would probably reduce the nitrile to an amine? Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a triple bond, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each step does. Let me think again:

A is reacting with HCN to form B. Then B is reduced to C. Then C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D eliminates an inert gas (like H2O or NH3?) to form E.
