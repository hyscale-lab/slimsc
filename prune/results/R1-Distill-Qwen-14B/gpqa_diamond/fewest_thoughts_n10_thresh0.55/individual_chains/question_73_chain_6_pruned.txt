Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Wait, and the options give different relative speeds and energies. So, the question is about calculating the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if two objects are moving at, say, v and u, their relative speed isn't just v minus u. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(cÂ²)). So, in this case, one is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. Wait, but which one's frame are we considering? Oh wait, when considering the relative speed of astronaut A (2m, 0.6c) from astronaut B's (3m, 0.5c) perspective, or the other way around? Wait, no, the problem just asks for their relative speed, which should be the same regardless of direction because it's a magnitude, but I need to make sure I get the signs right.

Wait, no, the formula gives the relative velocity of A as seen from B
