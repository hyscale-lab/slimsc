Okay, so I've got this question here about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that will cause a molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the question mentions a diatomic molecule with atoms X and Y. The parameters given are their masses (Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu), bond length R=2 angstroms, and angular frequency w=4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to determine the photon's momentum when it's absorbed to move to the next state.

Wait, I should remember what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the system. For a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether it's the rotational state or the vibrational state that's being considered here.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So I think that means both the vibrational and rotational parts are in their lowest states. The fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, n=0. The rotational state is also the ground state, so J=0 maybe? Or does the rotational state have J=1 because of the selection rules? Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, but the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? I think the energy levels in the rotation
