Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both instruments based on their magnitudes and other factors.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, that means stars that are brighter than 17 mag (lower numbers are brighter) can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star needs to be brighter than 16 in V for HIRES, and brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, no: the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that's m < 17, since higher magnitudes are dimmer. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, so m <16.

Wait, no. Wait, the more the magnitude, the fainter the star. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, star must have V mag <17. For HIRES, star must have V mag <16.

So a star that can be detected by both must have V mag <16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, but for HIRES, it needs to be brighter than 16. Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observed. So, m_v < 17 for ESPRESSO. HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed: m_v <16 for HIRES. So, to be observable by both, the star must have m_v <16, because that's the more restrictive condition.

Wait, no. Because a star with m_v =15 is less than 16, so it's observable by both. But if a star has m_v=16.5, then for ESPRESSO, it's m=16.5 <17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES requires m <16, so 16.5 is not
