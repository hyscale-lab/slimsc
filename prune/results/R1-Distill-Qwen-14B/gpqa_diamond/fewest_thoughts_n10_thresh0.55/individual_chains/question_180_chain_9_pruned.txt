Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, let me read it again carefully.

So, we have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. They're also saying the particles have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that; just focus on potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is, and the other twelve are all at 2 meters away from P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, but energy in an electrostatic system is usually the potential energy between the charges. For a system of point charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh right, that's the formula: U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j / r_ij).

But wait, since all the charges are identical, this might simplify things. Let me think about how many pairs there are.

There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at point P. The other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 charges, each at 2 meters. Also, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters apart from each other as well, right? Or wait, no, the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Are the twelve charges placed in a spherical arrangement at a radius of 2m, so each is 2m from P but varying distances from each other? Or are they all fixed at the same point 2m away from P? No, that can't be, because if they were all at the same point, the potential energy would be undefined or maybe very high due to like charges being on top of each other.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe each of the 12 is placed at a different point, all lying on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So each of them is 2m from P, but the distance between any two of them varies.

Hmm, but calculating the potential energy between all pairs would be complicated because I don't know the exact positions of the twelve charges relative to each other. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but wait a second. The potential energy between two like charges is positive because they repel each other. So to minimize the total potential energy, we want to arrange the charges as far apart as possible. But if all the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m around P, then the distances between any two charges would be at least 4m (if diametrically opposite), but on average, it's smaller. But in this case,
