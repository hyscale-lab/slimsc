Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to produce the corresponding butanoic acid. The options are combinations for A and B.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it's reacting with NaCN, I think that's a nucleophilic substitution maybe. Oh wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So reacting a ketone with NaCN... I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or something, the ketone can undergo a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group would be attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and the methyl groups. So the product is (CH3)C(OH)CN. So that's an addition of CN- to the ketone.

Wait, I think the reaction is the addition of cyanide to the ketone. But to add to a ketone, you need to protonate the carbonyl first, right? So the acid would help that. So for the first reaction, reagent A
