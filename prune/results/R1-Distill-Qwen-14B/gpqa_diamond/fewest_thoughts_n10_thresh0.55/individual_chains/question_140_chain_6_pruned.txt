Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. It says X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I recognize as around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C. Hmm, what substances have a melting point near there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Oh wait, maybe B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0. Not sure yet.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each W molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Common gases include H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc. Wait, H2 has 1 proton and 1 neutron per molecule, so total 2 atoms: each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That's equal. So W could be H2 gas? Or maybe another gas?

Wait, hydrogen gas (H2) is possible. Alternatively, another option might be CO2, but that doesn't fit because the number of protons and neutrons wouldn't match. Let's think:

If W is H2: H has 1 proton. The most common isotope is H-1 (protium),
