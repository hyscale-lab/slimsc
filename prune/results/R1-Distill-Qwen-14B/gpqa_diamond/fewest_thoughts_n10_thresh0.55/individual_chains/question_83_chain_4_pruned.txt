Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because titration questions can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right?

So, the initial concentration (C1) is 0.05 M, and the volume (V1) is 20 cm³. The final volume (V2) is 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2, I can find the new concentration C2.

Calculating that: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = C2 * 40 cm³. So, 1 = C2 * 40. That makes C2 = 1/40 = 0.0125 M. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025? Wait wait, no, wait: 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid initially is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. When diluted to 0.04 liters (40 cm³), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, okay, so 0.025 M. That makes sense.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The neutralization reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence first.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 mol (since 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol). So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 mol as well.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume (V) needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the volume we're titrating is 40 cm³. So 25% of that would be 10 cm³ (because 25% of 40 is 10). Oh wait, no. Wait, the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 50 cm³. Wait, no, the 25% refers to the titration, not the solution volume. So at 25% titration, we've added 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So NaOH added is 2.5 cm
