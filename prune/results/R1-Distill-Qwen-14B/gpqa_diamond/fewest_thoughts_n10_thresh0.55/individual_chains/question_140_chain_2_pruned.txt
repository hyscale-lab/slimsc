Alright, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm a bit new to this.

Okay, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. There are a bunch of clues to unpack here. Let's go through each part one by one.

First, the problem says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X has an element that's not the lightest isotope. Maybe like Cl having a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 versus Cl-37? I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y. I remember that some metals react violently with certain liquids. Like, sodium reacts violently with water. Oh wait, maybe Y is water. That makes sense because metals like potassium or sodium react vigorously with water. So if Y is water, what's X? Possibly a metal? Because metals react with water to produce hydrogen gas.

Then, the reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. Let's think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons in each molecule, which doesn't match. Next, maybe NH3? But ammonia is a liquid at room temp. Oh, wait, maybe it's another gas. Let's see. What about CO2? No, that's heavier. Or maybe CH4? No, that has 4 H's but the molecule would have 6 protons (C has 6, H each 1). Neutrons: C has 6, H have 0. So each molecule would have 6 (protons) and 6 (neutrons) in total? Wait, but each molecule has 5 atoms (C and 4 H). That might complicate things. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: nitrogen gas, N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's equal. Oh, that fits! So W is N2? But wait, when metals react with water, the gas produced is usually H2, not N2. Hmm
