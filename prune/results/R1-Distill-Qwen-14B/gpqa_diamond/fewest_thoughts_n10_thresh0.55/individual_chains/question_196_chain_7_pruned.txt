Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring, but relativistically. So, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I can't use the simple (1/2)mv² formula. Oh right, in relativity, kinetic energy is different.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But because we're dealing with relativity, maybe I need to use the relativistic expressions for energy.

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, right? Or wait, no, in relativity, the total energy includes both rest mass and kinetic. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, how does that work? Oh, right, because the energy isn't just non-relativistic kinetic and potential. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. 

Wait, the total energy E should be the rest mass energy plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². No, wait, no. Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position would be (1/2)kA², giving a maximum speed of sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case, which is option C. But since the question is relativistic, that's not the case.

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is different. The kinetic energy (K) is given by gamma mc² minus mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So K =
