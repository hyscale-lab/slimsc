Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance probably refers to a short-lived state. Oh wait, yeah, because particles with a short lifetime are unstable and decay quickly.

The question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. So mean decay distance... I think that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

Wait, how does that work? Oh right, particles that decay have a certain lifetime, but since they're moving at relativistic speeds, the distance they travel is velocity multiplied by lifetime. But since they're unstable, their lifetime is really short. 

So first, maybe I should find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. I remember the relation Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Or wait, more accurately, τ is ħ divided by Γ. Because the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I have to make sure the units are consistent. Γ is given in MeV, which is not the same as energy units in Joules. Oh right, I need to convert everything into compatible units.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. But maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think: I can work in units where ħ is in GeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds. So τ is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, but that's the proper lifetime, τ. But the particle is moving, so the lifetime from our lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, because of special relativity. The lifetime observed is γ times the proper lifetime.

So to find the lab frame lifetime, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ = E / (m c²), because E is the total energy. Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, because units-wise, if E is in GeV and m is GeV/c², then E/(m) gives the right dimensionless factor for gamma. So γ is approximately 6.6667.

So the lab frame lifetime is γ * τ = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 1.372e-23 seconds.

Then, the particle's velocity is needed to find the distance. Since the particle is relativistic, v is approximately c. Because for high energies, v ≈ c. So the distance L is v * t, which is approximately c * (γ τ).

Wait, no, wait. Because γ τ is the dilated lifetime. So L = v * (γ τ). But v is c multiplied by β, where β is v/c. Hmm. Alternatively, since γ is (1 - β²)^(-1/2), and for high gamma, β is close to 1.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to find the speed. Because for high energies, E ≈ pc. So p = E / c. Because E = γ m c², and p = γ m v. When v is close to c, p ≈ γ m c. So, E ≈ pc → p = E / c.

Wait, maybe I can compute the velocity beta. Beta is v/c. So beta can be found from the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So E=8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So,

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2 → 64 = p² c² + 1.44 → p² c² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 → p c = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p c ≈ 7.91 GeV → p ≈ 7.91 GeV / c.

But wait, p = gamma m v. And E = gamma m c². So, p = (E/(c²)) * v → v = (p c²) / E. Since E = 8 GeV, p c² is (7.91 GeV/c) * c² → 7.91 GeV c. So v = (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) → v = 0.98875 c.

So beta is approximately 0.98875, so v = 0.98875 c.

Alternatively, perhaps using beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ). Let me compute that:

m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So (m c²/E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, so yes, beta is about 0.9887.

So v is about 0.9887 times c. So, the velocity is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the decay length is c * τ * gamma * beta.

Wait, wait, because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and the velocity is beta c. So the decay length L is (gamma tau)*beta c.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), but maybe that's complicating it.

Wait, to recap. Steps:

1. Compute proper lifetime tau: tau = hbar / Gamma.

2. Compute gamma factor: gamma = E / (m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

3. Compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2) ≈ 0.9887.

4. Decay length L = beta c gamma tau.

So let's compute each step.

First, tau:

hbar ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

tau = hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666... ≈ 20/3.

Beta: as above, sqrt(1- (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Then L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

So let's plug in the numbers:

beta ≈ 0.9887,

c ≈ 3e8 m/s,

gamma ≈ 6.6667,

tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So L ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 ≈ 1.9999996e9 m/s. Approximately 2e9 m/s.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 2e9 * 0.9887 ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s.

Now multiply that by tau: 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

1.9774 * 2 is about 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056875 ≈ approximately 0.1125.

So sum is about 4.0673.

So 4.0673e-15 meters. That's 4.0673 × 10^-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So the closest is option B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because maybe I approximated too much.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation would give a better result.

Let me compute beta more accurately. Let's compute beta more precisely.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c².

So (m c²/E) = 1.2 /8 = 0.15.

So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute it accurately.

0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9775. Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.0087^2 is 0.00007569.

But perhaps a better approach: 0.9887^2:

= (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 ≈ 0.97752769. Which is approximately 0.9775, matching. So beta is 0.9887.

Then, back to L calculation:

Compute 0.9887 * 6.6667 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, perhaps to compute it step by step:

Compute gamma * tau: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37133e-23 s.

Then multiply by beta * c: 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.37133e-23 s) = 2.966e8 * 1.37133e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37133) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.37133 ≈ Let's compute:

2 * 1.37133 = 2.74266,

0.966 * 1.37133 ≈ approximately 1.3213.

Sum is about 4.06396, so 4.064e-15 m.

Which matches option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. So probably due to more precise calculations, the exact value is option B.

Wait another thing: when I computed gamma as 8/1.2, which is 6.666666..., but perhaps more accurately, 8 /1.2 is 20/3, which is approximately 6.66666666667.

So, let me perhaps compute gamma * tau more accurately.

gamma = 8 /1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.66666666667.

tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s.

Wait, no:

Wait hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is:

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875 → so tau is 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau is 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

6.6666666667 * 2.056875 = ?

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.6666666667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125.

So total is 12.34125 + 1.37125 ≈ 13.7125.

Wait, wait, no. 6.6666666667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875)/(3) )e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125 → so 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, no, 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24 ) /3.

Which is 41.1375e-24 /3 = 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, but that's 1.37125e-23 s.

So beta * c is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = 2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Compute 2.9661 * 1.37125:

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.9661 *1.37125 ≈ approx 1.3209.

So total ≈ 2.7425 + 1.3209 ≈ 4.0634.

So 4.0634e-15 m. Which is approximately 4.063e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
- **Production energy**: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Mass**: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)
- **Width**: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Step 1: Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper lifetime is related to the width by the uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]
Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Velocity Factor (\( \beta \))
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is calculated using:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}
\]
Substituting \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Decay Length (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is given by:
\[
L = \beta \cdot c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]
Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]
First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \tau \):
\[
\gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]
Next, calculate \( \beta \cdot c \):
\[
\beta \cdot c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]
Finally, calculate \( L \):
\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0634 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest match to \( L \approx 4.0634 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is **Option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
