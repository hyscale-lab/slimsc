Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, that means their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait a second. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. Oh, right! Because when a star moves towards us, the light gets blueshifted, and when it moves away, it's redshifted. But here, Star_2 is moving with a velocity, so maybe its observed wavelength is different? But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If Star_2 is moving, the spectrum would be Doppler shifted. So the actual emitting wavelength (from the star's frame) would be different from the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But Star_2 is moving, so its actual emitted λ would be different.

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose Star
