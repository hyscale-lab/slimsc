Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, but one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler. When we observe this star, the brightness variations because of the spots rotating into and out of view can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness dip when a planet transits a star depends on the area blocked. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) when a planet transits is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots that cause a brightness variation. So I need to calculate the equivalent ΔF from the spots and then find R_planet such that (R_p / R_star)^2 equals that ΔF.

First, let's figure out the photometric variation caused by the spots. The star's total brightness is affected when spots come into view. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star's brightness decreases.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the spot coverage is 20% of that, which is 10% of the entire star's surface. Because 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, right?

But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the star's surface area is 4πR², then each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

The star's total area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the surface area.

Now each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000K, and spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. The flux from the star is normally based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4. So the star emits F = σ*(6000)^4 per unit area. The spots emit F_spots = σ*(5000)^4.

The total flux without spots would be F_total = F * 4πR² (but wait, actually, F is the flux per unit area, so the total flux is F * 4πR²). When spots are present, some area is emitting less.

So the total flux when spots are present is: (Area without spots * F) + (Area with spots * F_spots).

The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 10%, so the unspotted area is 90%.

So the total flux when spots are visible is F_total_spots = F * 0.9 + F_spots * 0.1.

The change in flux compared to the star without spots is ΔF = (F_total_spots - F_total) / F_total.

Wait, more accurately, when the spots are visible (assuming the spots are on the hemisphere facing us), the flux drops. So the fractional change is:

ΔF = [F_total_spots / F_total] - 1.

Wait, let me think again. The star's flux without any spots is F0 = F * 4πR², where F is the flux per unit area at 6000K.

When spots are present, the flux is F0 * (0.9
