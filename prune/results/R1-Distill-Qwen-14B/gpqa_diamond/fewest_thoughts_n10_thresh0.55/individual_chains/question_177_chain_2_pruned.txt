Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question gives me some data: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. Then, their radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by what factor?

The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem says that both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, for a blackbody, the peak emission wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, that implies their temperatures are the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

But wait, the problem says the stars have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So both have the same λ_max, meaning same T. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The star's actual brightness in terms of maximum emission is just a function of their temperature. But the luminosity also depends on the radius. So if Star_1 has a larger radius and same temperature, its luminosity should be higher.

But wait another thing: the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh! Because of the Doppler effect. The star moving towards us (if radial velocity is positive or negative depending on direction) would have its light blue-shifted
