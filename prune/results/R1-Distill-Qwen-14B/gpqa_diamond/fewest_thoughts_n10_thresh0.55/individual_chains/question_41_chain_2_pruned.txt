Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about a light beam propagating through glass. The glass has an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question asks for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed is v = c/n. Wait, right, so in the glass, the speed of light is 1/n because c is 1 here. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So, from the lab frame, how does the glass's motion affect the light's speed?

I'm a bit rusty on relativity here. Oh wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer, I think we need to consider how velocities add in different reference frames.

But wait, when you're adding velocities, you can't just add them normally like Galileo suggested. You have to use the relativistic addition formula, right? Because light speed is involved, and relativity comes into play.

Wait, no, wait a second. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = 1/n (since c=1). But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of
