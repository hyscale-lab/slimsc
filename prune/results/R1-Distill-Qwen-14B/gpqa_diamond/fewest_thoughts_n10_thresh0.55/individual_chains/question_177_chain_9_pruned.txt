Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me think through it. So, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass part isn't directly relevant unless it's about something like temperature or something else.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, that implies they have the same temperature. Oh wait, so T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but how does that tie into their luminosities? Luminosity for a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T, because their lambda_max are the same, then the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But T1 and T2 are the same, so that part cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given R1
