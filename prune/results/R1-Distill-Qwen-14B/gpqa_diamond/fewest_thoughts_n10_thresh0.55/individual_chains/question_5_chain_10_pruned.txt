Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem is about a muon's operator P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum, but maybe here it's about the spin operator. Oh wait, muons have spin-1/2, so this makes sense.

The question asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the operator in question is the projection of P onto n, which would be something like P·n, right? Because when you have an operator along a direction, you take the component of each basis vector and combine them with the direction's components.

Wait, no, more accurately, the operator along direction n is given by P·n, which would be P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of n would be zero. So, n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x and n_z must satisfy n_x² + n_z² =1. Hmm, but wait, in the x-z plane, the direction vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the z-axis
