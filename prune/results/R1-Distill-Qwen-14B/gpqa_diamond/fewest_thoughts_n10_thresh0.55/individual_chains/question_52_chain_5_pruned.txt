Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the effective temperature decrease? Oh, because the spots are cooler, right? So the star's overall radiation is less when the spots are present.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They say that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. 

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, and it's observed to decrease when spots are present. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. 

Under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio n1/n2 would be the inverse: (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, but the ratio in the question is n1/n2. So when T decreases (since spots cause Teff to drop), what happens to n1/n2? The exponent is (E2-E1)/(kT). Since E2 > E1 (level 2 is higher energy), (E2-E1) is positive. So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. Because as T goes down, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases in magnitude but becomes more negative, right? Wait, no. Let me think: (E2-E1) is positive, k is positive, T is positive. So (
