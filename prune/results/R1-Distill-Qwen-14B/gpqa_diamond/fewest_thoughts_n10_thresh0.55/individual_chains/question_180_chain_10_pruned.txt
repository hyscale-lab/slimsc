Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, so each particle has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”it's all about the electric potential energy here.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. Hmm, point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the setup is that one charge is at P, and the other twelve are all at 2 meters away from P. But wait, are these twelve charges all at the same point, or are they arranged in some way?

Well, since their positions are constrained, I think the problem is simplifying things by considering them all at the same distance from P. Because if they were spread out, it would complicate the potential energy calculations, especially since each of them would contribute to the potential at different points. But since all twelve are at 2 m from P, perhaps they're considered to be at the same location, but that might not make sense because in reality, identical charges can't occupy the same point unless they're fixed there, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m, not necessarily all at the same spot.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this situation as a point charge at P and then a bunch of other
