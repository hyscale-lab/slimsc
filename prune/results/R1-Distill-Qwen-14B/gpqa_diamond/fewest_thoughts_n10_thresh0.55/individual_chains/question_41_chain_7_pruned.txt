Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They give c=1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially in physics, you have to consider how different frames of reference perceive velocities. Oh right, this is probably a problem involving special relativity, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. And the light is inside the glass. Hmm.

Wait, but I also recall that the speed of light in a medium (like glass) is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, the problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab. So the glass is moving, and the light is inside the glass. So I think this is about the addition of velocities between the medium and the light. 

In classical mechanics, if the medium is moving at speed v, then the speed of light in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v, but wait, that can't be right because in reality,
