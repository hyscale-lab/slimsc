Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that when particles decay, their mean path length depends on their lifetime and their velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor multiplied by the velocity. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the mean decay length (L) is given by L = c * τ * β, where τ is the proper lifetime, c is the speed of light, and β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, τ is related to the particle's width. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but units! I need to be careful with units here.

Let me jot down the known values:

Production energy E_X is 8 GeV.
Mass m_X is 1.2 GeV.
Width Γ_X is 320 MeV.

Wait, so E is the energy of the produced meson, m is its rest mass, and Γ is the decay width.

But to find the decay width, I think I might need to relate E and m to other quantities. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the width Γ is given, so I can use it directly.

So, first
