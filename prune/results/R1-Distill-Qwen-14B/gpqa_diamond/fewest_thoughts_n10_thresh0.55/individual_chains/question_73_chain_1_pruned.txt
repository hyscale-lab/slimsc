Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, first, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally because of relativistic effects. I remember that special relativity has a specific formula for adding velocities. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(cÂ²)).

Wait, but wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one from the other's frame would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted by that formula. Let me get that straight.

So astronaut A is 2m mass moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. From A's frame, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c, but wait, no, relativistic addition isn't as simple as that. No, wait. Wait, no: actually, the formula is for how B's speed appears from A's frame. So v_rel = (v
