Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator A_y is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct during this calculation.

Hmm. So, first, I think I should write down the matrix S and then compute A_y by multiplying by c.

Wait, S is given as:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then, A_y is c * S, where c is h/(4π).

So, substituting c, A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Let me compute A_y explicitly.

A_y matrix:
First row: (h/(4π)) * 0 = 0, (h/(4π)) * (-i) = -i h/(4π)
Second row: (h/(4π)) * i = i h/(4π), (h/(4π)) * 0 = 0

So A_y =
[ [0, -i h/(4π)],
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of A_y. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Matrix (A_y - a I) is:
[ [-a, -i h/(4π)],
  [i h/(4π), -a] ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a) ] - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, the determinant calculation: (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So,

Determinant = (-a)(-a) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Let me compute each part.

First term: a^2.

Second term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16 π²)

But (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i * i is i² = -1, so -i * i = -(-1) = 1.

So the second term is (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So the determinant equation becomes:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So,

a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/ something? Wait, let me compute.

Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π ), because sqrt(1
