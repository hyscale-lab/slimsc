Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out the structure of Compound X, which is necessary before I can determine what happens when it reacts.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: That's a broad region, which might indicate O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an alkoxy group, but the broadness suggests -OH. Alternatively, it could be an amine, but the other peaks might help decide.
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.
- 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1: These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols (like -OH) typically show up around 1-5 ppm, but carboxylic acids are usually around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets indicate two sets of equivalent protons, probably in a para arrangement. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 2.9. Maybe a CH adjacent to an oxygen or something electronegative, like in a carbonyl group. Or maybe a CH in a chain next to a branching point.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons. Maybe next to a branching point or part of a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three hydrogens. This looks like a CH2CH3 group attached to something else, maybe a methyl group adjacent to a CH that's part of a chain.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three hydrogens, likely a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the benzene ring is para-substituted. So one substituent is a carboxylic acid group, and another substituent is a side chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR again. The
