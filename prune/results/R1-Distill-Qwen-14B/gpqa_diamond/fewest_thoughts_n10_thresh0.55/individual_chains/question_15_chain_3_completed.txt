Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. Oh wait, but mass isn't directly the same as radius. Oh right, but the question provides the radii of the host stars. Both host stars have the same radius because it says they do. So that part is equal.

So the probability of transit depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on to us. But how is that determined? I think the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by ( (a_planet) / (a_planet * sin i) )... Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me recall. The transit probability (P) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So it's just (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that's only the geometric probability. Oh, right, but the geometric probability also depends on the orbital inclination. Oh wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1 / (a / R_s)) ), no, maybe not.

Wait, I think the actual probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ), but wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size and the star's size. Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the distance from Earth? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think from another angle. The transit probability (P) is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (a_p) / (sqrt(a_p^2 - d^2)) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Another approach: the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a_p / R_s) ) * something...

Wait, no, I'm mixing up the terms. I think the key factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p)^2 )) )^(1/2). Or wait, maybe it's more straightforward. The transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / (a_p^2 - R_s^2))^(1/2). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general expression. Let me think: the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / ( (a_p / R_s) * sin i )) ), but wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the Hill sphere or the orbital plane.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p)^2 )^(1/2)) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I should think about the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on, and when the planet is larger relative to the star. But in this case, both stars have the same radius, so the only varying factor is the planet's size. Wait, no, both planets have the same mass, but their radii might be different. Oh wait, the question says they have the same masses, but they don't necessarily have the same radii. Hmm, but the question provides the radii of the host stars, not the planets. So perhaps the planet's radius isn't given.

Wait, the question says the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets. So assuming Earth-like, their radii would be about the same as Earth's. So R_p is same for both planets. Or wait, no, the question says both have the same masses, but as they are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are similar. So R_p is same.

Wait, but I don't know if that's correct. The question says that the host stars have same radii. So R_s is same for both. So if R_p is same, then (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both. So that can't be the reason to choose one over the other. Then why do the options suggest different probabilities?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing another factor. Oh, wait! The probability also depends on the orbital period. Because a shorter period means the planet is closer to the star, which affects the transit probability. Let me think.

The transit probability formula also includes the term (R_p / a_p)^2, but wait, no. Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p)^2 )^(1/2)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_p / a_p)^2. Because the cross-section for transit is π (R_p)^2, and the area of the star is π R_s^2. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's the geometric probability, assuming random orientation. But if the planet's orbit is known, perhaps the probability depends on other factors like the inclination.

Wait, but in the question, RV method has already been used, so the planets' orbits must be in a certain configuration. Oh, right, the RV method actually gives you the minimum mass and tells you that the planet's orbit is edge-on (since RV detects the Doppler shift based on the component of velocity along our line of sight). Wait, no, RV method can only measure the component of the velocity along the line of sight, which implies that the inclination is such that the velocity is maximum. So the RV method doesn't confirm that the orbit is exactly edge-on, just that the minimum mass is measured. So the true mass could be higher if the inclination is different. So for transit, the probability depends on the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for the transit to occur.

Wait, but in this question, the planets have already been detected via RV, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. But since we're trying to detect transits, the probability will depend on the alignment. So the question is, which planet has a higher probability of transiting.

So the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / ( (a_p / R_s) * sin i )) )? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p)^2 )^(1/2)) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I came across a formula that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another source says the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2))) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a_p) ?

Wait, I think I should step back. The key factors are:

1. The geometric probability, which is (R_p / R_s)^2.

2. The likelihood of the planet being in an edge-on orbit relative to us.

Wait, but the RV method tells us something about the inclination. Because the RV method measures the velocity along the line of sight. So if the RV semi-amplitude is K, then the true mass is (minimum mass) / sin i, where i is the inclination angle. So if the planet's true mass is higher than the minimum mass, sin i must be less than 1, meaning i is less than 90 degrees. Wait, no, sin i is maximum when i=90 degrees (edge-on), so if the RV method gives a minimum mass, the actual mass could be higher, implying that sin i is less than 1. So this suggests that the orbit is not perfectly edge-on. But wait, that's the case for the RV method. For transit, we need the orbit to be edge-on. So even if the RV method has detected the planet, the transit method's probability depends on the actual inclination.

But in this case, the RV method has already been used, and the planets are Earth-like, but does that affect their transit probability? Hmm.

Wait, but the way the question is posed, the researchers are trying to choose between observing Planet_1 and Planet_2 based on which has a higher probability of transiting. So given the information, which of the two has a higher chance.

So, the key factors are (R_p / R_s)^2 and the relative distance a_p.

Wait, since the host stars have the same radius, R_s is same for both. So (R_p / R_s)^2 is same for both, assuming R_p is same. But Earth-like planets have similar radii, so R_p is same.

Then, the other factor must be the orbital period, which is related to the semi-major axis a_p via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a_p)^3 / (P^2) = (G (M_s) ) / (4 π^2 ), so a_p is proportional to (M_s * P^2 )^(1/3).

Given that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P_1 = P_2 /3.

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star.

So let's compute a_p for each planet.

For Planet_1:

a_1^3 = (G M_1 (2 M_2) ) * (P_1)^2 / (4 π^2 )

Wait, no, Kepler's law is a_p^3 = (G M_s P^2 )/(4 π^2 )

So let's denote M_2 as M, so M_1 is 2M. P_1 is P_2 /3.

So a_1^3 = (G * 2M * (P_2 /3)^2 ) / (4 π^2 )

But a_2^3 = (G M * P_2^2 ) / (4 π^2 )

Taking the ratio a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (2M * (P_2^2 /9) ) / ( M * P_2^2 ) ) = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a_1^3 = (2/9) a_2^3 → a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is around 0.6. So a_1 ≈ 0.6 a_2.

So Planet_1 is much closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, how does that affect the transit probability?

The transit probability depends on the ratio R_p / a_p. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, which is a_p away. So the probability increases when a_p is smaller, because the area of the star is the same.

Wait, but the geometric probability of transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, according to my notes, the transit probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_p / R_s )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. R_p and R_s are lengths, a_p is a length. So (R_p/R_s)^2 is dimensionless, multiplied by (a_p/R_s) which is dimensionless. So perhaps that's the case. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p ), which would be (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) ) = (R_p^2)/(R_s a_p).

But I've heard another formula: P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p)^2 )^(1/2) )

Ah, that makes sense. So, for a given a_p, the closer the planet is (smaller a_p), the higher the denominator term (since (R_s/a_p) is smaller, making (1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 ) larger, so the denominator is larger, making the overall probability smaller. Wait, that would mean that for a planet at a smaller a_p, the probability is higher.

Wait, no, the denominator (1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 )^(1/2) is less than 1, so 1 divided by that is greater than 1. So, higher a_p would mean (R_s/a_p) is smaller, so denominator is closer to 1, so 1/denominator is closer to 1. So higher a_p leads to higher P.

Wait, but wait, the formula is (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/( sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2) )

So for a given R_p and R_s, the probability increases as a_p increases, because the denominator approaches 1, making the term larger.

So which planet has a larger a_p? Earlier calculation shows a_1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a_2 ≈ 0.6 a_2, so a_2 is larger.

Thus, Planet_2 has a larger a_p, which would make 1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2) larger, hence higher transit probability.

But wait, since R_s is same for both, let's compute the term for both.

Let me compute (R_s/a_p)^2 for each planet.

For Planet_1: (R_s / a_1)^2 = (1/(a_1))^2 * R_s^2. Since a_1 = 0.6 a_2,

(R_s/a_1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a_2)) )^2 = (1/(0.6))^2 * (1/a_2^2 ) = (1/0.36) * (1/a_2^2 )

For Planet_2: (R_s/a_2)^2 = (1/a_2)^2 * R_s^2.

So, for Planet_1, the term (R_s/a_p)^2 is (1/0.36) times that of Planet_2.

So, 1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 for Planet_1: 1 - (1/0.36)(R_s^2/a_2^2 ) = 1 - ( (1/0.36) (R_s/a_2)^2 )

But wait, because a_2 is larger, (R_s/a_2)^2 is smaller than (R_s/a_1)^2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me plug in numbers.

Let's assume R_s = 1 unit for both stars.

Then, a_1 = 0.6 a_2.

So for Planet_1:

(R_s / a_1)^2 = (1 / 0.6 a_2 )^2 = (1/(0.6))^2 * (1/a_2^2 ) = (1/0.36) * (1/a_2^2 )

For Planet_2:

(R_s / a_2)^2 = (1 / a_2 )^2.

So, for Planet_1, (R_s/a_p)^2 = (1/0.36) * (R_s/a_2)^2 = (1/0.36 ) * P2_term.

So, the denominator sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 ) for Planet_1 is sqrt(1 - (1/0.36) * (R_s/a_2)^2 )

But I think I need to find the ratio of the transit probabilities for the two planets.

Let me denote:

P1 = (R_p1 / R_s)^2 * 1 / sqrt( 1 - (R_s/a_1)^2 )

P2 = (R_p2 / R_s)^2 * 1 / sqrt( 1 - (R_s/a_2)^2 )

But since R_p1 = R_p2 (assuming Earth-like), and R_s is same, their ratio is:

P1 / P2 = [1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_1)^2 ) ] / [1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_2)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= sqrt( (1 - (R_s/a_2)^2 ) / (1 - (R_s/a_1)^2 ) )

But a_1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a_2 ≈ 0.6 a_2.

So a_1 = 0.6 a_2 → a_2 = a_1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667 a_1.

Wait, no, since a_1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a_2, let me find a_1 in terms of a_2.

But perhaps it's easier to express a_2 in terms of a_1.

Wait, given that M1 = 2 M2,

And from Kepler's law,

a_p^3 = (G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π^2 )

So for Planet_1:

a1^3 ∝ (M1) * P1^2 = 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 = (2 /9 ) M2 P2^2.

For Planet_2:

a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2^2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667 a1.

So, R_s/a1 = R_s/(0.6 a2) = (1 /0.6) * (R_s / a2) ≈ 1.6667 (R_s/a2).

So (R_s/a1)^2 = (1.6667)^2 (R_s/a2)^2 ≈ 2.7778 (R_s/a2)^2.

So, (R_s/a1)^2 ≈ 2.7778 (R_s/a2)^2.

Now, let's compute the denominator terms:

Denominator for P1: sqrt( 1 - (R_s/a1)^2 ) = sqrt( 1 - 2.7778 (R_s/a2)^2 )

Denominator for P2: sqrt( 1 - (R_s/a2)^2 )

So the ratio (P1/P2) is sqrt[ (1 - (R_s/a2)^2 ) / (1 - 2.7778 (R_s/a2)^2 ) ) ]

Wait, but this requires knowing (R_s/a2)^2. Let me denote x = (R_s/a2)^2.

Then, P1/P2 = sqrt( (1 - x) / (1 - 2.7778 x) )

But without knowing x, how can I proceed? Maybe I can relate x to the star's size and the planet's orbit.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the star's radius is much smaller than the planet's orbital distance. Because for typical stars and planets, a_p >> R_s. So x is very small.

If x is small, we can approximate the denominator using a Taylor expansion.

So sqrt( (1 - x) / (1 - 2.7778 x) ) ≈ sqrt( (1 - x) (1 + 2.7778 x ) ) 

Because 1/(1 - a x) ≈ 1 + a x when a x is small.

So (1 - x)(1 + 2.7778 x) ≈ 1 - x + 2.7778 x - 2.7778 x^2.

Which simplifies to 1 + (2.7778 -1)x - 2.7778 x^2 ≈ 1 + 1.7778 x.

So P1/P2 ≈ sqrt( 1 + 1.7778 x )

Which is approximately 1 + (1.7778 x)/2, since sqrt(1 + y) ≈ 1 + y/2 for small y.

So P1 is approximately (1 + 0.8889 x ) times P2.

Wait, but if x is small, 0.8889 x is small, so P1 is a bit larger than P2.

But this contradicts my earlier thought that higher a_p (Planet_2) would have a higher probability. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, according to our earlier setup, P1 is for Planet_1, which has a smaller a_p. If x is small, then P1 is a little higher than P2.

But let's think in terms of actual numbers. Let's assume R_s is 1, and a2 is 1 AU, so a1 is 0.6 AU.

Then, x = (1/1)^2 = 1. Oh wait, that's not possible because if a_p is the same as R_s, then (R_s /a_p)=1, and the denominator becomes sqrt(1-1)=0, which is impossible. So that suggests that a_p must be larger than R_s, which is why a_p is larger in reality.

So let's take a2 as 2 AU, then a1 is 1.2 AU (since 0.6 * 2 =1.2). Then R_s is 1, so (R_s/a2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 0.25 → x=0.25.

Then, P1/P2 = sqrt( (1 - 0.25)/(1 - 2.7778 * 0.25) )

Compute denominator: 2.7778 * 0.25 = 0.69445.

So 1 - 0.69445 = 0.30555.

So numerator inside the sqrt is (0.75)/(0.30555) ≈ 2.454.

So sqrt(2.454) ≈ 1.566.

So P1 is about 1.566 times P2, meaning Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but that's with a2 =2 AU. What if a2 is larger? Let's try a2=3 AU. a1=1.8 AU.

x = (1/3)^2 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111.

Compute P1/P2:

Numerator in sqrt: (1 - 0.1111) = 0.8889.

Denominator: 1 - 2.7778 * 0.1111 ≈1 - 0.309 ≈ 0.691.

So 0.8889 / 0.691 ≈ 1.286 → sqrt(1.286) ≈ 1.134.

So P1 is 1.134 times P2. So higher than P2, but not as much.

But if a2 is larger, the ratio approaches 1. So in the case where a2 is very large, x approaches 0, and P1/P2 approaches sqrt( (1 - 0)/(1 -0) )=1.

So, in general, it depends on a2. But if a2 is small, like a2=0.5 AU, then x= (1/0.5)^2=4, which is impossible because a_p must be larger than R_s. So a_p must be larger than R_s for the planet to orbit without collision.

So perhaps the transit probability is higher for the planet with the shorter orbital period, i.e., Planet_1.

But this contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability depends on the ratio R_p / a_p. Because when a_p is smaller, the planet is closer, so the chance of it passing in front of the star is higher. Because the star's disk is the same size, the planet has a larger solid angle to cover when it's closer. So (R_p / a_p) is larger → higher probability.

Wait, but the formula I thought of earlier included (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 ), which seems to suggest that for a_p smaller, the denominator is smaller, so 1/denominator is larger, leading to higher probability.

Wait, so let me think in terms of variables:

Each planet's transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * 1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 )

Since R_p and R_s are same for both, the ratio P1/P2 is sqrt( [1 - (R_s/a2)^2 ] / [1 - (R_s/a1)^2 ] )

But a1 is smaller than a2. So (R_s/a1)^2 > (R_s/a2)^2.

So the denominator for P1 is sqrt(1 - larger term ), making the denominator smaller, so P1 is larger.

Yes! So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

So the probability is higher for Planet_1 because its a_p is smaller, leading to a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check with the numbers. Let's take a1 = 0.6 a2.

Assume a2 = 1.5 AU → a1 = 0.9 AU.

R_s=1 → (R_s/a1)^2 = (1/0.9)^2 ≈ 1.234.

Then, 1 - (R_s/a1)^2 = 1 -1.234 = -0.234. Wait, that's negative, which can't be possible. So a_p must be larger than R_s, so (R_s/a_p) must be less than 1.

So in reality, a_p must be larger than R_s. So let's choose a2 such that a_p > R_s.

Let me pick a2 = 2 R_s → a2 =2. Then a1= 0.6 *2=1.2.

So R_s=1, a2=2 → (R_s/a2)^2 = 0.25 → x=0.25.

(R_s/a1)^2 = (1/1.2)^2 ≈ 0.6944.

So for P1:

1 - (R_s/a1)^2 = 1 - 0.6944 = 0.3056 → sqrt is ≈ 0.553.

For P2:

1 - 0.25 = 0.75 → sqrt is ≈ 0.866.

So P1 = (1/0.553) = approx 1.808.

P2 = (1/0.866) ≈1.1547.

Since (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both, the ratio is P1/P2 = 1.808 /1.1547 ≈ 1.564.

So P1 is about 1.56 times P2.

Wait, but that's only for the term 1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 ), since (R_p/R_s)^2 is same.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.56 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, according to our calculation, it's about 1.56 times, which is closer to option B, but option C is 1.65.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute (R_s/a1)^2 = (1/1.2)^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈0.6944.

So 1 - (R_s/a1)^2 = 36/36 -25/36 =11/36≈0.3056.

So sqrt(0.3056)= approx 0.553.

For Planet_2: (R_s/a2)^2 = (1/2)^2=0.25 → 1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt=0.866.

Thus, P1/P2 = (1/0.553)/(1/0.866) )= (0.866)/(0.553)=approx 1.564.

Which is about 1.56, so approximately 1.6 times.

Wait, 1.564 is about 1.56, which is close to 1.6. So looking at the options, option C says ~1.65 times.

Hmm, but maybe if I use more precise numbers.

Let me compute 1/0.553 is approximately 1.807.

1/0.866 is approximately 1.1547.

1.807 /1.1547 = approx 1.564.

Wait, perhaps this is because the assumption about a2 being 2 R_s may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should find a more accurate relation.

Wait, according to Kepler's law:

a_p^3 ∝ M_s * P^2.

So for Planet_1: M_s = 2 M (Planet_2's star), P = P2/3.

So a1^3 ∝ 2 M * (P2^2 /9 )

a2^3 ∝ M * P2^2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Thus, with a1 = 0.6 a2, and R_s same for both.

So (R_s/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(0.6))^2 * (1/a2^2) = (2.7778) (1/a2^2 )

Which is 2.7778 times (R_s/a2)^2.

Thus, for Planet_1, the term (1 - (R_s/a1)^2 ) = 1 - 2.7778 (R_s/a2)^2.

Wait, but for a2, (R_s/a2) must be less than 1.

Let me denote y = (R_s/a2)^2.

Then for Planet_1, (R_s/a1)^2 = 2.7778 y.

So, for the transit probability ratio:

P1/P2 = sqrt( (1 - y) / (1 - 2.7778 y) )

We can write this as sqrt( (1 - y) / (1 - ( (2.7778) y )) )

But without knowing y, we can't find the exact ratio. However, for a planet, a_p must be much larger than R_s, so y is small.

Assume y is very small.

Expand the denominator:

1 - 2.7778 y ≈ 1 (since y is small).

So denominator ≈1.

Thus, P1/P2 ≈ sqrt( (1 - y) / 1 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - y ) ≈ 1 - y/2.

But since y is small, this suggests P1 is slightly lower than P2. But that contradicts our earlier calculation where P1 was higher.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that y is very small is incorrect. Let's think of y as (R_s/a2)^2 ≈ (1/a2)^2.

If a2 is 1.5 R_s, then y = (1/1.5)^2 ≈0.444.

So for a2=1.5 R_s:

y = (1/1.5)^2 = (2/3)^2= 4/9≈0.444.

Then, for Planet_1:

(R_s/a1)^2 = 2.7778 * 0.444 ≈1.222.

Which is greater than 1, which implies a1 < R_s, which is impossible. So a2 must be larger than R_s.

So let's pick a2=3 R_s → a2=3.

Then, a1=0.6 *3=1.8.

(R_s/a1)^2 = (1/1.8)^2 ≈0.316.

(R_s/a2)^2= (1/3)^2≈0.111.

So for Planet_1: 1 -0.316=0.684 → sqrt=0.827.

For Planet_2:1 -0.111=0.889 → sqrt=0.943.

So P1/P2 = (1/0.827) / (1/0.943) = 0.943 /0.827 ≈1.14.

So P1 is about 14% higher than P2.

Alternatively, if a2 is 4 R_s → a1=2.4 R_s.

(R_s/a1)^2= (1/2.4)^2≈0.1736.

(R_s/a2)^2=(1/4)^2=0.0625.

So for Planet_1: 1-0.1736=0.8264 → sqrt≈0.909.

Planet_2:1-0.0625=0.9375 → sqrt≈0.968.

P1/P2 = (1/0.909)/(1/0.968) )= 0.968 /0.909 ≈1.065.

So P1 is about 6.5% higher.

Hmm, in this case, P1 is still higher but the difference is small.

But in the earlier example where a2=2 R_s, P1 was about 1.56 times P2.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when a2 is just slightly larger than R_s, the ratio becomes significant.

Let me take a2=1.5 R_s → a1=0.6 *1.5=0.9 R_s.

But R_s=1, so a1=0.9 which is less than R_s=1 → impossible. So a2 must be larger than R_s, so a1 =0.6 a2 must also be larger than R_s.

So let's take a2=2 R_s → a1=1.2 R_s.

(R_s/a1)^2= (1/1.2)^2≈0.694.

(R_s/a2)^2= (1/2)^2=0.25.

For Planet_1: 1-0.694=0.306 → sqrt≈0.553.

For Planet_2:1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt≈0.866.

P1/P2 = (1/0.553)/(1/0.866 )= (0.866)/(0.553)≈1.564.

So P1 is about 1.56 times P2.

Which is approximately 1.56, so about 1.6 times.

Looking at the options, option C says ~1.65 times, which is a bit higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 0.866 /0.553 accurately.

0.866 /0.553 → 0.553 * 1.564 = 0.866.

So 1.564 is the ratio.

Which is approximately 1.56 times, or about 1.6 times. So the closest option is C) ~1.65 times.

Wait, but option C is 1.65, which is higher than 1.56.

Another approach: perhaps the transit probability is higher for the planet with the shorter period because it transits more frequently, not because each transit is more probable. But the question seems to be about the probability of a transit occurring during observation, not the frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV method gives a constraint on the minimum mass, but the actual mass might be higher, which would mean a lower inclination. But the question says that both planets have the same mass, so that's not the case.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same minimum masses, but I think the actual masses could be higher, but the question says they have the same masses, so their true masses are the same. So I think the inclination is random.

But actually, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but if the true mass is the same as the minimum mass, that would mean sin i =1, i.e., edge-on orbit. But that's not possible because the RV method can't determine the inclination exactly.

But according to the question, both planets have the same masses, so RV has detected their true masses, meaning their orbits are edge-on. Wait, no, because RV gives the minimum mass, unless you have additional information.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key factors are:

- Both have same R_p and R_s.

- Transit probability depends on a_p and R_s.

So the closer the planet is (smaller a_p), the higher the transit probability.

Since Planet_1 has a shorter period and a lower mass star (Wait, no: Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. So M1=2 M2.

Using Kepler's law: a_p^3 = (G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π^2 )

So for Planet_1: a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P1)^2 → P1 = P2 /3 → a1^3 = 2 M2 (P2^2 /9 )

For Planet_2: a2^3 = M2 P2^2 → a2^3 = M2 P2^2 → a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → a1≈0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller, so transit probability higher for Planet_1.

Thus, the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1, so researchers prefer to observe Planet_1.

Now, the question is about the probability ratio. My earlier calculation with a2=2 R_s gave a ratio of about 1.56, which is roughly 1.56.

Looking at the options:

Option C: ~1.65 times → about 1.65.

Option D: ~2.7 times → much higher.

Hmm, 1.56 is close to 1.6, but the options don't have that. The options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So our calculation says Planet_1 is preferred, and the ratio is ~1.56. The closest option is C) 1.65.

But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute the ratio when a2=2.

Compute a1=1.2.

(R_s/a1)^2 = (1/1.2)^2 = 1/1.44 ≈0.694.

(R_s/a2)^2= (1/2)^2=0.25.

So for Planet_1:

1 -0.694 =0.306 → sqrt≈0.553.

For Planet_2:

1 -0.25 =0.75 → sqrt≈0.866.

So P1/P2 = (1/0.553)/(1/0.866 )= (0.866 / 0.553 )=1.564.

So 1.564 is about 1.56, which is closer to option C's 1.65 than to option D's 2.7.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another factor. What about the fact that the star's mass affects the RV semi-amplitude, which affects the actual inclination. But the question states that both planets have the same mass, so for RV, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / sin i ) / (M_s)^(1/3), but I'm not sure how this affects the transit probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of transit is also influenced by the Doppler shift and the actual inclination, but the question states that the RV method has already been used, meaning that the planets' masses are known, implying that sin i is 1 (edge-on orbits), which would mean that the transit probability is 100% for both. But that's not the case because RV can't confirm an edge-on orbit, only give a minimum mass.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it can't determine the inclination. So the true mass is M_p / sin i ≥ M_min. So if both planets have the same M_min, but their true masses could be higher, but the question says they have the same masses, so sin i must be 1. So the orbits are exactly edge-on, leading to a 100% transit probability. But that's not possible because the RV method can't confirm edge-on orbits exactly.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The question states that both planets have the same masses, so their true masses are the same as the minimum masses. So their orbits must be edge-on, meaning that the transit probability is 100% for both. But that can't be, as RV can't confirm edge-on, but only gives the minimum mass.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the transit probability formula.

Transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 )) ).

But since both have same R_p and R_s, the ratio is sqrt( (1 - (R_s/a2)^2 ) / (1 - (R_s/a1)^2 ) )

Which, given a1=0.6 a2 → R_s/a1 = (1/0.6) (R_s/a2 ) → (R_s/a1)^2 = (2.778)( R_s/a2 )^2.

So, ratio becomes sqrt( (1 - x ) / (1 - 2.778 x ) ), where x=(R_s/a2)^2.

If x is small, 2.778 x is small, so denominator ≈1, numerator≈1 -x → ratio≈ sqrt(1 -x ) ≈1 - x/2.

Thus, P1≈ (1 -x/2) P2.

If x is small, P1 is slightly higher than P2.

But when x is not small, P1 could be significantly higher.

But without knowing x, perhaps the only way is to note that a1 is smaller, so the transit probability is higher, so the answer is C or D.

Wait, but the options suggest that the probability is higher for Planet_2 in option A and B, which would be the case if a_p is larger.

Wait, no. Let me think: if a_p is larger, then (R_s/a_p ) is smaller, so (R_s/a_p )^2 is smaller. So the denominator 1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 is larger, making 1/sqrt( ... ) larger. So higher a_p → higher transit probability.

Ah! So if Planet_2 has a larger a_p, its transit probability is higher. So Planet_2 is preferred.

Wait, this contradicts our earlier conclusion. Which is correct?

Wait, the transit probability formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 ) )

So when a_p is larger, (R_s/a_p ) is smaller → denominator is larger → 1/denominator is smaller → P is smaller.

Wait, no, denominator is sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 ), so when a_p is larger, (R_s/a_p ) is smaller → 1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 is closer to 1 → denominator approaches 1 → 1/denominator approaches 1.

Wait, so when a_p is larger, the second term (1/sqrt(...)) approaches 1, so P is larger.

Wait, no, let me rephrase.

If a_p is larger, R_s/a_p is smaller → (R_s/a_p )^2 is smaller → 1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 is closer to 1 → sqrt( ... ) is close to 1 → 1/sqrt(...) is close to 1.

If a_p is smaller, R_s/a_p is larger → (R_s/a_p )^2 is larger → 1 - something large could be negative, which is impossible, so a_p must be larger than R_s.

Thus, for a_p much larger than R_s, the term approaches 1. For a_p just slightly larger than R_s, the term is significantly less than 1.

So, transit probability increases as a_p increases, because the denominator becomes closer to 1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's compute the term for a_p = 2 R_s.

(R_s/a_p )^2 = (1/2)^2=0.25 → 1 - 0.25=0.75 → sqrt(0.75)=0.866 → 1/0.866≈1.154.

For a_p=3 R_s:

(R_s/a_p )^2=1/9≈0.111 → 1-0.111=0.889 → sqrt≈0.943 → 1/0.943≈1.06.

So as a_p increases, the term 1/sqrt(...) approaches 1, so the probability approaches (R_p/R_s)^2.

Thus, the transit probability is higher when a_p is larger.

So Planet_2 has a larger a_p, leading to higher transit probability.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me find a clear formula.

According to the transit probability formula, the probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 )) )

Which can be approximated as (R_p/R_s)^2 * (a_p / sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2) )

But in any case, the key is that as a_p increases, the term (1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 )) approaches 1, making P approach (R_p/R_s)^2.

So when a_p is large, P is higher.

Thus, Planet_2, with a larger a_p, should have a higher transit probability.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that when a2 is 2 R_s, a1 is 1.2 R_s. Let me compute the transit probability ratio again.

For a1=1.2 R_s and a2=2 R_s:

(R_s/a1)^2= (1/1.2)^2≈0.694 → 1-0.694=0.306 → sqrt≈0.553 → 1/0.553≈1.807.

(R_s/a2)^2= (1/2)^2=0.25 → 1-0.25=0.75 → sqrt≈0.866 → 1/0.866≈1.154.

Thus, P1=1.807 * (R_p/R_s)^2,

P2=1.154 * (R_p/R_s)^2.

So P1/P2 = 1.807 /1.154≈1.564.

So P1 is higher.

But according to the formula, as a_p increases (from 1.2 to 2 R_s), the term 1/sqrt(...) increases from 1.807 to 1.154, which contradicts the earlier assertion that higher a_p leads to higher probability.

So what's wrong here? Oh wait, because for a1=1.2 R_s, the term is higher. So in this case, Planet_1 has higher probability.

But as a_p increases further, what happens?

Let me take a_p=3 R_s: (R_s/a_p)^2=1/9≈0.111 → 1 -0.111=0.889 → sqrt≈0.943 → 1/0.943≈1.06.

So as a_p increases from 1.2 to 3 R_s, the term decreases from 1.8 to 1.06.

Thus, the transit probability increases as a_p approaches R_s from above, and decreases as a_p increases beyond that point.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because for a_p approaching R_s, the probability would be higher, but for a_p much larger, the probability approaches (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_p / a_p )^2 * (something).

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find the correct formula for transit probability.

Upon checking, the geometric transit probability is:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a_p,

Wait, no, that can't be right. Another source says the probability is approximately:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ) * (1 / (1 - (R_s/a_p)^2 )^(1/2) )

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: the probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star.

The area ratio is (R_p / R_s )^2.

The probability of alignment is 1/(a_p / R_s ), assuming a random orientation.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The alignment probability is the fraction of orbits that are edge-on enough for transit. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_p / a_p ) / (something).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should refer to the formula.

The correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s )² * ( (a_p ) / ( sqrt(a_p² - R_s²) ) ) )

Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I found a reference that says the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s )² * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a_p )² )^(1/2) )

Which is the same formula I've been using.

But when a_p is much larger than R_s, (R_s/a_p )^2 is negligible, so P approaches (R_p/R_s )².

But when a_p is just slightly larger than R_s, (R_s/a_p )^2 is close to 1, making 1 - (R_s/a_p )^2 small, so P is large.

Wait, but in the case where a_p is 1.2 R_s, (R_s/a_p )^2 ≈0.694. 1-0.694=0.306 → sqrt=0.553 → 1/0.553≈1.807.

So the transit probability is higher.

Thus, for a_p close to R_s, the transit probability is higher.

So in our problem, Planet_1 has a smaller a_p (0.6 a2), so if a2 is larger than R_s, a1 could be either larger or smaller than R_s.

Wait, if a2 is 2 R_s → a1=1.2 R_s.

Thus, Planet_1's a_p is 1.2 R_s, which is larger than R_s, so transit is possible.

In this case, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2.

So the correct choice is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Looking back at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

In my earlier calculation with a2=2 R_s, the ratio was 1.56, which is closer to option C's 1.65.

But another way to calculate it more accurately:

Compute the ratio P1/P2 = sqrt( (1 - y ) / (1 - 2.7778 y ) ), where y=(R_s/a2 )².

Assume a2 = (R_s * sqrt(3) )) → a2= R_s *1.732.

Then y= (1/(1.732 ))^2= (0.577)^2≈0.333.

So for Planet_2: (R_s/a2 )²=0.333.

For Planet_1: (R_s/a1 )²= 2.7778 *0.333≈0.925 → which is larger than 1. Impossible.

Thus, a2 must be larger than sqrt( R_s² /0.333 ) → a2 > 1.732 R_s.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think in terms of the given options and the calculations I've done.

In the a2=2 R_s case, the ratio is approximately 1.56, which is close to option C's 1.65.

But perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{R_s}{a_p}\right)^2}}
\]

### Key Factors:
1. **Same Host Star Radius**: Both planets orbit stars with the same radius \( R_s \), so the term \( \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \) is identical for both planets.
2. **Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**: Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a_p \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_s \). For Planet_1, \( M_s = 2M \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). This results in:
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2 \implies a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} a_2^3 \implies a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 a_2
   \]
   Thus, Planet_1 orbits much closer to its star than Planet_2.

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**: The transit probability depends on \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{R_s}{a_p}\right)^2}} \). For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \left(\frac{R_s}{a_2}\right)^2}{1 - \left(\frac{R_s}{a_1}\right)^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( a_1 = 0.6 a_2 \), we find:
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_s}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{R_s}{a_2}\right)^2 = 2.7778 \cdot \left(\frac{R_s}{a_2}\right)^2
   \]
   Let \( x = \left(\frac{R_s}{a_2}\right)^2 \). Then:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - x}{1 - 2.7778x}}
   \]
   For small \( x \), the denominator \( 1 - 2.7778x \) becomes smaller, making \( P_1 > P_2 \). Numerical calculations for specific \( a_2 \) values (e.g., \( a_2 = 2R_s \)) confirm that \( P_1 \) is approximately 1.56 times \( P_2 \), which is close to the option \( \sim 1.65 \).

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital period and closer distance to its star. The closest option to the calculated ratio is **C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit**.

Answer: C
