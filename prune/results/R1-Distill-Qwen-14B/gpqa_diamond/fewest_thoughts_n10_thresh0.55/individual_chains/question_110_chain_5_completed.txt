Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. The key is figuring out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. 

From the question, I know that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, correction: it's brighter than 17 mag. So apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes mean dimmer objects. So for ESPRESSO, the star's V mag must be ≤17.

But wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no, wait. Because the way it's worded: "brighter than 17 mag", which would be apparent magnitude less than 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So for example, a star with apparent magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so it's acceptable for ESPRESSO. 

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So their apparent V must be ≤16. Because anything brighter (lower mag) than 16 would be acceptable for HIRES.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So m <17. Because 17 is the limit. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16, so m <16.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. Because 17 is fainter than 16. So, for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, apparent V mag should be less than 17. For HIRES, apparent V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed", which means m <17? Because brighter than 17 would imply lower magnitude. So, for a star to be observed by both, it needs to have m <17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and m <16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no. Wait, no, wait: if a star is brighter than 17, it can be observed by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16. So, to be observed by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than both 17 and 16, which is brighter than 16. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So the more restrictive condition is that the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's ≤16, then it's also ≤17, so both can observe it.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the way the question is phrased, both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe the star. So the star's apparent V mag must be such that it's ≤17 for ESPRESSO (because it's brighter than 17) and also ≤16 for HIRES (because it's brighter than 16). So the star must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says that for ESPRESSO, the limit is brighter than 17 mag. So the star's apparent mag must be <17. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent mag <16.

So for a star to be observed by both, it's apparent mag must be <16. Because that way, it's <17 for ESPRESSO and <16 for HIRES. So the star must have an apparent V mag ≤15, because 16 is the limit (brighter than 16 --> m <16). So any star with m ≤15 would be detected by both.

Wait, but let's check each star. Maybe some need to have their apparent magnitude calculated from their absolute magnitude and distance. 

Star1: absolute magnitude Mv =15.5, distance 10 pc. Apparent mag is Mv +5log10(d/10) = 15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent mag is 15.5. Which is less than 16. So both telescopes can see it. Because 15.5 <16, so it's within the limit for both. So Star1 can be observed by both.

Star2: apparent mag is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, it's observing m <17. So this star is m=16.5<17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, they need m <16. So 16.5 is too dim for HIRES. So Star2 can't be seen by both.

Star3: absolute magnitude is 15.5, located at 15 pc. So apparent mag is Mv +5log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(log10(15/10)) =15.5 +5*(log10(1.5)).

What's log10(1.5)? Approximately 0.176. So 5 * 0.176 = 0.88. So apparent mag is 15.5 +0.88=16.38. But wait, wait. Oh wait, no, because the distance modulus is M - m =5 log10 (d/10). So the formula is m = M +5log10(d/10). So yeah, 15.5 +0.88=16.38. But wait, the star's E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. So I need to correct for extinction.

The question says the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So A(V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for extinction is m_observed = m_true + A(V). Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so higher magnitude.

Wait, no: the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, and with extinction, it's m0 + A(V). So in this case, the star's apparent magnitude would be 16.38. Then add the extinction. 16.38 +1.86=18.24 mag. So the apparent V is 18.24, which is way above both 16 and 17. So for both ESPRESSO and HIRES, this star is too dim. So Star3 can't be observed by either.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake. The absolute magnitude is M. The apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M +5 log10 (d/10). Then, the observed m is m0 + A(V).

So for Star3: M=15.5, d=15 pc. So m0=15.5 +5*(log10(1.5)) =15.5 +0.88=16.38. Then, A(V)=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So m_observed is 16.38 +1.86=18.24. So yes, too dim for both. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Star4: absolute magnitude Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc. So m0=15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5+0=15.5. Then, E(B-V)=0.4. So A(V)=3.1*0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So apparent mag is 16.74. 

ESPRESSO needs m <17, which is true. HIRES needs m <16, which is not true (16.74>16). So Star4 is too dim for HIRES, but can be seen by ESPRESSO. So it can't be observed by both.

Star5: Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc. So m0=16.5 +5*(log10(5/10))=16.5 +5*(log10(0.5))=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0. 

Does it have any extinction? No, the question says Star5 has Mv=16.5, located at 5 pc. No E(B-V) mentioned, so no extinction. So apparent mag is ~15.0. 

So for ESPRESSO, m=15 <17: yes. For HIRES, m=15 <16: yes. So both can observe Star5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. m0 = M +5 log10 (d/10) =16.5 +5*log10(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5-1.505=14.995, about 15.0. No extinction, so m_observed=15.0. So HIRES can detect (15<16), and ESPRESSO can detect (15<17). So both can see Star5.

So which stars are observable by both? Let's go through each:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can see it. Because 15.5 <16 for HIRES and <17 for ESPRESSO.

Star2: m=16.5. ESPRESSO can see (16.5<17), but HIRES cannot (16.5>16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m_observed=18.24. Neither can see.

Star4: m=16.74. ESPRESSO can (16.74<17?), wait, 16.74 is less than 17, so yes. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, for ESPRESSO, the limit is brighter than 17 mag, so m<17. 16.74 is less than 17, so yes. But for HIRES, m must be <16. 16.74 is higher, so HIRES can't see. So Star4 can be seen only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see it.

So which stars can be detected by both? Stars1 and Star5?

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Option D) Star1 and Star4. Wait, but Star4's m is 16.74, which is detectable by ESPRESSO (because <17), but not by HIRES (since 16.74>16). So only Star1 and Star5 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, let me go back to the stars. Star1 and Star5 are the only ones that can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Let me recount:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can see.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see.

So those two are the ones that are detectable by both.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4 can't be seen by both, so A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5: Star3 can't be seen by either, so B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3: neither can be seen by both. So C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star4 can't be seen by both (HIRES can't detect it), so D is incorrect.

Wait, wait, that's confusing. Wait, none of the options have Star1 and Star5.

Wait, the options are:

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option C: Star2 and Star3.

Option A: Star4 and Star5.

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Hmm, but according to my analysis, only Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But that's not one of the options. So did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m0=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5 pc. m0=16.5 +5*(log10(0.5)) =16.5 -1.505≈15.0. No extinction. So m=15.0. Both can detect.

So both Star1 and Star5 can be observed by both telescopes. But looking at the options, the options don't have an option with both Star1 and Star5. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check each star again.

Wait, Star4: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. m0=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. A(V)=1.24. So m_observed=15.5+1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74. 

For ESPRESSO: m must be <17 → 16.74<17 → yes.

For HIRES: m must be <16 → 16.74>16 → no.

So Star4 can't be seen by HIRES. So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can see.

Star1: m=15.5. Both can see.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, only option A is Star4 and Star5, which is not correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm, none of the options have both Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated Star5's apparent magnitude.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

Apparent magnitude without extinction: m0 = Mv +5 log10 (d/10) = 16.5 +5*(log10(0.5)).

Log10(0.5)= -0.301. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m0=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So yes, m=15.0.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). But looking at the options, there's no option that includes both.

Wait, the options are: 

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74, which is outside HIRES' limit. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 is way too dim, so B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → both can't be seen by both, so C is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by both, so D is wrong.

Wait, but none of the options match. That can't be possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the apparent magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck Star5. Star5's Mv is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m0 = 16.5 +5 * log10(5/10) → 5/10 is 0.5, log10(0.5)= -0.301.

So m0=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is ~15.0. So correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the extinction for Star3 and Star4.

Wait, for Star4, E(B-V)=0.4. A(V)=3.1 * 0.4=1.24. So m_observed =15.5+1.24=16.74. So m=16.74.

So for Star4: m=16.74. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, 16.74 is too big. So Star4 can't be seen by HIRES. So only Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus formula. The formula is m - M = 5 log10 (d / 10 pc ), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the apparent magnitude is the total after extinction. Wait, no, the question provides E(B-V) and says that the absorption is related with a coefficient of 3.1. So for each star with E(B-V), the extinction is A(V)=3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V). Because without extinction, m is m_intrinsic, and extinction makes it brighter? Wait no, wait: extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so m increases. So if a star is at m_intrinsic, with extinction, it's m_intrinsic + A(V).

Wait, no, wait: no, wait, no. If a star is at m_intrinsic, then when we add extinction (absorption and scattering), the observed magnitude becomes m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V). Because extinction makes it appear dimmer, so higher magnitude.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the stars have their apparent magnitude within both limits.

Looking back:

Star1: m=15.5. ESPRESSO: yes (15.5 <17). HIRES: yes (15.5 <16? No, 15.5 is less than 16. So yes, HIRES can detect it. Wait, wait. No, wait, 15.5 is less than 16. Because 16 is the limit. So m=15.5 is acceptable for HIRES. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none have both. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is 16.74 → only ESPRESSO can see.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 is 18.24 → neither can see.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5 (ESPRESSO can see, HIRES can't), Star3 too dim.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

So none of the options match. Hmm. Did I misread the question?

Wait, the question says: which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So the correct answer should be the two stars that have apparent V mag ≤16.

So Star1 and Star5.

But in the options, there's no option with both. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Star3 can't be seen by either.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can't be seen by both.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. m0=15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5 +0=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5.

So Star1's m=15.5. HIRES: m must be <16 → 15.5 is okay. So yes, Star1 is observable by both.

Star5: m=15.0, same logic.

So the only possible correct pair is Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps Star4 is observable by both.

Wait, Star4: m_observed=16.74. ESPRESSO can see (m <17), but HIRES can't (m must be <16). So only Star1 and Star5 are correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question says that both spectrographs can observe it, but I'm looking for any star that can be observed by both.

So which stars are observable by both? Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by both.

So none of the options have Star1 and Star5. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the apparent magnitude limits.

For ESPRESSO: stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. So any star with m <17 can be observed. So m <17.

For HIRES: stars brighter than 16. So m <16.

So a star can be seen by both only if m <16.

So which stars have m <16?

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

Others:

Star2: m=16.5 → no.

Star3: m=18.24 → no.

Star4: m=16.74 → no.

So only Star1 and Star5 can be seen by both.

But the options don't include this combination. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Let me double-check.

The distance modulus is m - M =5 log10 (d) -5, where d is in parsecs. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Which is the same as m = M +5 (log10(d) -1) = M +5 log10(d/10).

Yes, same as before.

So Star1: d=10 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5. So m =15.5 +5*(1) -5=15.5. Correct.

Star5: d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897. 5*0.69897=3.49485 → m=16.5 +3.49485 -5=16.5 + (-1.50515)=14.99485→15.0. Correct.

So I think my calculations are correct.

But the options don't have Star1 and Star5. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible. So perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, looking back: the question says "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So m <17. Similarly for HIRES, m <16.

So the only stars with m <16 are Star1 (15.5) and Star5 (15.0).

But the options don't include both. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering that Star3 has m=16.38 before extinction. Let me recheck Star3.

Star3: Mv=15.5, d=15 pc. So m0=15.5 +5 log10(15/10)=15.5 +5*log10(1.5)=15.5 +0.88=16.38. Then, E(B-V)=0.6 → A(V)=1.86. So m=16.38+1.86=18.24. So correct. So Star3's m=18.24, which is too high for both.

So the only stars that can be observed by both are Star1 and Star5, but no option includes them. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction for Star4.

Wait, Star4's E(B-V)=0.4. So A(V)=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, m must be <16. So Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the correct answer should be Star1 and Star5, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: Star1 and Star4.

But Star4 can't be seen by both. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the question. It says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, brighter than 17 mag: does that mean m <17 or m >17? Because brighter objects have lower magnitudes.

Wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 17 mag" implies that the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because if an object is brighter, its magnitude is lower. So for example, a magnitude 15 star is brighter than a magnitude 20 star.

So for ESPRESSO, m <17.

Similarly, for HIRES, m <16.

So a star must have m <16 to be seen by both.

So which stars have m <16?

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

But according to the options, none. So perhaps the intended answer is A: Star4 and Star5.

But Star4's m is 16.74, which is greater than 16, so can't be seen by HIRES.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the answer that includes Star5, as it's the only one that's definitely in both.

Looking at the options, option B includes Star3 and Star5. But Star3's m is 18.24, which is too high. So that can't be.

Option A includes Star4 and Star5. Star5 is correct, but Star4 is not.

So perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 can be seen by both. But no option lists only Star5.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck Star5's parameters. Star5 has Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m0 =16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5-1.505=14.995 → ~15.0.

So it's within both limits.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the apparent magnitude for Star1 is 15.5. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, 15.5 is acceptable. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Similarly, Star5 can be seen by both.

So the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But that can't be right because Star4 can't be seen by both.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the distance modulus for Star1.

Wait, Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m0=15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5. Correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is that Star1 and Star5 can be seen by both, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D (Star1 and Star4), but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star5's extinction. Looking at the data, Star5 doesn't have any extinction mentioned, so m=15.0.

In that case, Star5 is observable by both.

So the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but the options don't have this.

So perhaps the intended answer is that Star5 is the only one, but again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but the options don't list this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction for Star3.

Wait, Star3: Mv=15.5, d=15 pc → m0=16.38. E(B-V)=0.6 → A(V)=1.86 → m=18.24.

So no, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option D: Star1 and Star4.

But no, Star4 can't be seen by both.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which stars can be seen by either, not both. But the question says "can be detected with both".

So I'm at a loss. Based on calculations, the correct answer should be Star1 and Star5, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the star must be observable by both, but the apparent magnitude for Star5 is 15, which is within both limits.

So the correct answer is Star1 and Star5. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

But Star4's m is 16.74, which is too high for HIRES.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that Star4's m after extinction is 16.74, which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES requires m <16, so Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the only correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But no option includes this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the apparent magnitude for Star5.

Wait, Star5's Mv is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So the distance modulus is 5 log10(5/10) =5 log10(0.5)=5*(-0.301)=-1.505.

So m0=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 → 15.0.

So correct.

So the only stars that can be seen by both are Star1 and Star5.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be seen by both.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on calculations, the correct answer is Star1 and Star5. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I'm not confident.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. The ESPRESSO spectrograph can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while the HIRES spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). Therefore, a star must have $m < 16$ to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M_V = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - No extinction mentioned, so $m = 15.5$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent magnitude $m = 16.5$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 16.5 > 16$, so Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M_V = 15.5$, distance $d = 15 \, \text{pc}$, extinction $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(15 / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \times 0.176 = 15.5 + 0.88 = 16.38
     \]  
   - Extinction correction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = m_0 + A_V = 16.38 + 1.86 = 18.24
     \]  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 18.24 > 17$, so Star3 cannot be detected by either spectrograph.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M_V = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, extinction $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction correction:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 16.74 > 16$, so Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M_V = 16.5$, distance $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \times (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - No extinction mentioned, so $m = 15.0$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 15.0 < 16$, so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1** ($m = 15.5$) and **Star5** ($m = 15.0$). However, none of the provided options include both Star1 and Star5. Among the given options, **Option D (Star1 and Star4)** is the closest, but Star4 cannot be detected by both spectrographs. Despite this inconsistency, **Option D** is selected as the answer.

**Answer: D**
