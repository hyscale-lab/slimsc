Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are both high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. But the key here is figuring out which stars each can observe based on their apparent magnitude limits.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties. Let me list what I need to know: each star's apparent V magnitude because that's what the spectrographs' brightness limits depend on. Wait, but some stars are given in absolute magnitude, and others might have extinction or distance that I need to calculate apparent magnitude for.

First, I should recall that apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. Oh, and if there's extinction (E(B-V)), that affects the V magnitude as well. The formula for extinction in V is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + Av.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: if a star's absolute magnitude is given, and its distance, I can compute its apparent magnitude without extinction. But if it's affected by dust (like in the case of Star3 and Star4), I have to add the extinction to the apparent magnitude because extinction makes the star appear dimmer. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So, if a star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m, and it has extinction, the observed m is m + Av.

Now, the spectrographs have different limits. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V=17 mag, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can see stars up to V=16 mag (brighter than 16, so up to 16.0). So, the star's apparent magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must satisfy both conditions. Because to be detected by both, it must be within both spectrographs' limits. So the apparent magnitude must be <=16, because if it's higher than 16, HIRES can't detect it, even though ESPRESSO can.
