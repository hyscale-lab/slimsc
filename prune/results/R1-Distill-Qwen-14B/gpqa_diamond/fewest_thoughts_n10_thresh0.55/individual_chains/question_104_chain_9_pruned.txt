Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. So when a planet orbits a star, the star moves a bit, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the size of the star's wobble. Since both stars have the same mass and are similar to the Sun, the main difference would be the orbital period and the planet's mass. Or maybe the velocity of the star?

I recall that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards or away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p)^(1/3)) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / sin i) * (1 / (1 day in seconds or something)). But maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity. The shift (in wavelength) depends on the velocity via the formula delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but maybe in this problem, the exact shift is directly proportional to the velocity because the same wavelength is observed each time.

So, if the RV shift is proportional to the star's velocity, and since both stars have the same mass, but different shifts, that implies their velocities are different. 

The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ). Wait, no, maybe the formula is K = (v) = ( (2Ï€ G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )) ?

Alternatively, maybe a simpler approach is better. Both stars
