Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization when the energies are high. Let me think about each option one by one.

First, the question: Which theory never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), C) QED (Quantum Electrodynamics), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are like infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results nonphysical. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite so you can handle them properly.

So I need to think which of these theories are free from such divergences, especially at high energies. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a quantum theory of gravity, and it's supposed to be a theory of everything. One of the big things about string theory is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because it's a background-independent theory. Wait, but wait, I think string theories also require some form of regularization or renormalization to handle certain aspects, like in loop calculations. Or maybe they don't because they're dealing with strings instead of point particles. I'm a bit fuzzy here. Superstring theories are finite? Or do they need some form of regularization?

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. So perturbative methods work well there. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have divergences? No, I think QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and like any gauge theory, it can have divergences in loop diagrams. So I think QCD does require regularization, maybe even more so because of the non-abelian nature leading to more complex divergences. But wait, since it's asymptotically free, the divergences may not be as severe as in other theories?

Option C: QED. Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, which means it can handle its divergences via renormal
