Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents and catalyst for the reaction. Let's start by understanding what's happening in the reaction.

The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and after reacting with compound A under acid catalysis, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, I think I should draw the structures to visualize better.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on carbon 3. The product has a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene part would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond—like a cyclohexene derivative but maybe substituted.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidene group is attached to the pyrrolidine at position 1. The cyclohexylidenemethyl group would be a methylene group (CH₂) connected to a cyclohexene ring, right? So the structure would have a CH₂ linked to the cyclohexene, attached to the nitrogen of pyrrolidine.

Now, thinking about reactions that form such a structure. The most common reaction that forms a ring with a double bond and a substituent is the Wittig reaction. Or maybe some kind of alkylation or conjugate addition. Wait, but the starting material is a pyrrolidine, which is a cyclic amine. So maybe it's an alkylation where the nitrogen is getting a new substituent.

Wait, another possibility is that the pyrrolidine is undergoing some kind of ring expansion. Or perhaps a cycloaddition. Alternatively, maybe it's an enamine formation. Oh wait, enamine synthesis could be a possibility here.

Enamines are typically formed from a ketone or aldehyde and an amine. The process involves two steps: first, the amine (like pyrrolidine) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an imine, and then it loses water to form the enamine. But how does that lead to the cyclohexylidene group in the product?

Wait, another approach. The product has a cyclohexylidene group
