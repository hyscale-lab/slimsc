Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme where compound A goes through several reactions to form compound E. I need to identify what E is from the given options. 

Let me start by listing out what each reaction does.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm, and there are some hints provided.

Hint a) says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. 

Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So, compound A must be a carbonyl compound because it reacts with a Wittig reagent. The product is an alkene.

The product given in hint a) is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw that structure. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH(CH3)CH2?) Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of propane? Or wait, the ylidene group would have a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps it's a substituent that's attached via a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH(CH3)-, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH(CH3)- connected as a substituent on the ring at position 4. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, a CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2 group? Wait, no, I think the propan-2-ylidene is actually (CH2)2C=CH2? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

But perhaps I should focus on what the Wittig reaction tells me about compound A. Since the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an alkene, compound A must have a
