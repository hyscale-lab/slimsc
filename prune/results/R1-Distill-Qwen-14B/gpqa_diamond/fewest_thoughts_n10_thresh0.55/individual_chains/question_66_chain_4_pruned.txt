Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, beyond the Standard Model, without introducing new particles. So the operators must be consistent with certain symmetries.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Lorentz symmetry involves transformations between different inertial frames, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. But in the context of field theory, when we talk about symmetry principles, Poincare symmetry is the broader one. But SMEFT is a effective theory, so maybe the symmetries are considered in a certain way.

Wait, SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, so the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM, except for the ones that are broken by the effective operators. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT should too. Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry, but in SMEFT, I think the operators are local, so they respect all the symmetries that the SM respects, including Poincare. Or is it automatically included?

Wait, no. Poincare includes translations, which imply momentum conservation. But in an effective theory,
