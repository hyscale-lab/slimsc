Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built from the Standard Model, which itself respects certain symmetries. Effective theories usually incorporate the symmetries of the underlying theory, but maybe add some modifications.

Let me go through each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz symmetry: I think all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT is an extension, not a violation. So the operators must transform in the right representations of the Lorentz group. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a low-energy effective theory.

2. Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect both. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because SMEFT is built to describe physics up to some cutoff scale, and if the cutoff is high, maybe some Poincare stuff is okay. But wait, Poincare includes momentum conservation and stuff. Oh, but wait, the question is about all operators respecting the symmetry. I think SMEFT does respect Poincare because it's a field theory, so it's Poincare invariant. So operators must be Poincare-symmetric.

Wait, but Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question lists them as separate options. So which one is it? The question is, which symmetries must all operators respect. Maybe both Lorentz and Poincare are required. Because Poincare is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations.

But wait, actually, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required?

But wait, the options are 1,2, etc. Option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. So if both 1 and 2 are required, then option A would have both. But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically included because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory?

Alternatively, maybe Poincare is broader, including things like momentum conservation, so all terms in the theory must respect that.

Wait, but I think that in SMEFT, the operators are organized into terms that are Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a Poincare-invariant term. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Then onto 3 and 4.

3. CP symmetry: Wait, the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT, which includes the Standard Model as a subset, can have CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the Lorentz group includes PT transformations in some way. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT.

So putting it together: Symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So options 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is part of the structure, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must individually respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz? So if an operator respects Poincare, does it also respect Lorentz? So when the question asks which must be respected, the operators must respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz is also respected. But the question lists them as separate options.

Alternatively, perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators are built from terms that are Lorentz scalars, hence respecting Lorentz symmetry. And since the theory is a field theory, it's Poincare-invariant as a whole, but do each operator respect it? Wait, the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which must be Poincare-invariant. So each term in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So yes, each operator is Poincare-invariant, meaning both 1 and 2 are required.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So option C.

Wait, but wait. Are Poincare and Lorentz separate in the question? Because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if the operator respects Poincare, it's automatically respecting Lorentz. So would the question include both as separate required symmetries? Or would 2 (Poincare) encompass 1 (Lorentz), making 2 sufficient?

Hmm, the question says "must be respected by all operators". So each operator must be invariant under each of these symmetries.

Wait, but the SMEFT operators are built in such a way that they are Lorentz scalars, so they are Lorentz-invariant. And since the entire theory is a field theory, translation invariance (another part of Poincare) is also present, so each operator is part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

But the options are given separately. So the correct must-include options would be 1,2,4.

So the answer would be C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which forms its foundation. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must transform appropriately under the Lorentz group, making Lorentz symmetry a requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it respects Poincaré symmetry, meaning all operators must be part of a Poincaré-invariant Lagrangian. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is allowed in the framework.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C) 1,2,4**.

Answer: C
