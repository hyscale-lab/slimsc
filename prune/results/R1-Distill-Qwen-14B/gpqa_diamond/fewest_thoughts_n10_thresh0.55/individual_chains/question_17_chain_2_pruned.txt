Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it forms complexes with metal ions. In this case, it's forming a complex with calcium. The formula for the complex is Ca-EDTA, I guess CaEDTA²- or something like that.

Wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric complex. Stochiometric, so the molar ratio is 1:1. So each calcium ion binds with one EDTA molecule. That makes sense.

The concentration given is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without any dissociation, the concentration of Ca²+ would be the same as the complex, right? But wait, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something. So the solution isn't just 0.02 M Ca²+ because some of the complex dissociates.

The K given is the stability constant, K for the complex formation. I think the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. So, K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the solution is the complex itself. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex at equilibrium is 0.02 - x. But wait, if x is the amount dissociated, then the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of free EDTA would be x as well. Because each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the expression for K would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+
