Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from school that when light passes through different media, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, this glass is moving too. So I need to consider both the glass's motion and the light's speed within it.

The problem states that the glass has an index of refraction n. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving with velocity v in the lab frame. I'm supposed to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any motion, the speed would be 1/n because c=1 here. But since the glass is moving, does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame?

I'm a bit rusty on this. I think this is a case where I need to use special relativity. Because if the medium (glass) is moving, then the speed of light as observed might be different. But wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, no, that's in a vacuum. Here, the light is moving through a medium, so perhaps the usual refractive index applies, but also considering the motion.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh, right, because the glass is moving, the
