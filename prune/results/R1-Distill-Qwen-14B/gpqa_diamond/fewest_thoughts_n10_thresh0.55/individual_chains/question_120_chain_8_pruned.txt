Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. And I think the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if plx is small, the star is really far away.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in the sky according to the question. Uniformly distributed—does that mean their density per unit volume is constant? So the number density of stars is the same everywhere. If that's the case, then the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how much volume is available at a particular distance.

Since parallax is related to distance, the number of stars in a given range of parallax depends on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance. Because parallax plx is 1/d, the distance d is 1/plx. So the shell's thickness would correspond to a small change in plx, which relates to a change in distance.

Let me try to model this. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd would be proportional to the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd), assuming uniform density. So N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that in. So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d(1/plx)/dplx) * dplx.

Wait, I should express everything in terms of plx. The change in plx with distance is d(1/plx) = -1/(d plx)^2, but wait, maybe I should find how dd relates to dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dd = -dplx / plx². The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But for the purposes of calculating volume, I can ignore the sign and consider magnitude. So dd = dplx / plx².

Wait, no, because d is 1/plx, so when plx increases, d decreases. So the thickness in distance, dd, is (d plx)/(d plx)^2) times d plx, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (dd). But the thickness in terms of plx is dplx. So, dd = (d plx) * (d d) ?

Wait, perhaps I should express dd in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So,
