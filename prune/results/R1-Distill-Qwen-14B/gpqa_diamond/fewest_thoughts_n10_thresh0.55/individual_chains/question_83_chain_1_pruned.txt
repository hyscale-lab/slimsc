Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what's happening in each part. Let me break it down.

First, the initial dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. Since we're adding equal volumes, the concentration should be halved, right? So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making it 40 cm³ total. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, so after dilution, the new concentration would be 0.025 M. Because M1V1 = M2V2, so 0.05 * 20 = M2 * 40 → M2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025 M. Got that down.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, correct. So the moles of acetic acid remain the same. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

Next part: Titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction should be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.
