Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think through this.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed, v_max.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². Then, the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0) is (1/2)mv_max². But that's classical, and this is relativistic, so I can't directly use that approach.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy that's conserved. The total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Oh wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, potential and kinetic energies are exchanged, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't as straightforward. Maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy and momentum.

But wait, the harmonic oscillator is a conservative system. So the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential) should be conserved. But in relativity, the concepts are a bit different. Let me try to model this.

At the maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so its velocity is zero. So the kinetic
