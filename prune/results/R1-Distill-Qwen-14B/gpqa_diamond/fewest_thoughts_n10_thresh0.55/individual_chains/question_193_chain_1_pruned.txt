Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Wait, parallax and distance are related, right? Oh yeah, I remember that parallax (denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So parallax plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs, I think). So if the distance increases, parallax decreases. Got that.

The question states that the number of stars, N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to distance, substituting that in might help. Let's see: plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So substituting, 1/plx^5 becomes (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5? Wait, wait. Let me write this out.

So, plx = 1/r. So, 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. So N ∝ (r)^5. That would mean the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because if the parallax is smaller (since r is larger), then 1/plx^5 would be larger. So more stars
