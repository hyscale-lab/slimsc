Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

So, what do I remember about the RV method? Oh right, the method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull making the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the velocity of the star towards and away from us.

Each planet causes a shift in their star's spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of the orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, but how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K might be involved here.

I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:
K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_p / M_s))^(1/3)
But wait, maybe it's better to think of the relation between the RV signal and the mass of the planet. Oh, right, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters.

Alternatively, the formula I'm thinking of relates the planet's orbital period to the velocity shift. But maybe I should recall the formula for the semi-amplitude K:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_s)^(2/3) (c) )

But wait, the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, so M_p/M_s is negligible, right? Because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's. So the denominator can be approximated as 1, so K is proportional to (M_p) / (P)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again
