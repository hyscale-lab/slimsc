Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels of this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I remember from my particle physics class that the possible decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can interact with.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. Oh right, Yukawa couplings involve a scalar (the X here) interacting with fermions. The general form is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So the interaction is between the boson X and the fermion ψf.

The mass term for the fermion usually comes from the same interaction when the scalar field X gets a vacuum expectation value (vev), but in this case, I think the mass of X is given, so we're more concerned with its decay products.

The boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The key here is whether the energy required for the decay is possible. Since X is a boson, it must have enough mass to produce the fermion pair. The rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV each? Because each fermion and its antiparticle would sum to twice the mass (since they have the same mass). Wait, no, actually, for decay into a pair, the total energy required is 2m_fermion. So m_X must be >= 2m_fermion.

Wait, but wait. For a spin-0 boson, when it decays into fermions, the fermions are in an s-wave state. The condition is that the total invariant mass (which is the mass of X) must be at least twice the fermion mass. But for charged particles, I think the mass comes into play differently because they come in pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible fermion species and their masses. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
