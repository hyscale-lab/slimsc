Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography here. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance in a crystal can be found using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me try to think through this.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral... I think that means all the edges are the same length, and all the angles are equal too. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, and the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and all angles are the same.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember there's a formula for interplanar spacing d_{hkl} which is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²)(cos α + cos β + cos γ)/something... Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. No, wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case, the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think for a rhombohedral system, the formula might be d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ), but wait, in rhomboh
