Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to synthesize this compound called 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, I remember that ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. So, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with another cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group, and also a formyl group (-CHO) somewhere. Wait, no, let me look closer. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, that means on the cyclohexane ring, there's a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, and another substituent, which is the carbaldehyde group (CHO) also at position 1? Or maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that has a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane, and a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures to visualize better. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡CH). The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, and perhaps a CHO group on the same carbon? Or maybe the substituent is a CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane, and another group like a formyl? Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2OH group connected to another cyclohexane ring, and also has a formyl group attached. Or perhaps it's a molecule where one of the cyclohexane rings has a CH2OH substituent and another has a formyl. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has a CH2-OH group attached to another cyclohexane, and the same carbon has a formyl group (-CHO). So, the structure is something like cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group and a formyl group on the same carbon. Or maybe it's a geminal di-substitution: the same carbon has both a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH and a formyl group. Wait, that might not be possible. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-(cyclohexyl(methyl)ol)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning that the cyclohexane has a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH, and also a formyl group on that same carbon. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a carbon that has both a formyl group and a CH2-O-cyclohexane group attached. But wait, can a carbon have two substituents like that? Oh yes, like a quaternary carbon. So, the carbon at position 1 of the cyclohexane has a formyl group (-CHO), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2-OH), and two cyclohexane rings attached? Or perhaps, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where on one carbon, there's a CH2-OH group connected to another cyclohexane, and the same carbon also has a formyl group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the steps involved. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding groups step by step.

Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond, so maybe we can do some kind of alkyne chemistry. Common reactions with alkynes include hydration, addition of halogens, or using them in coupling reactions. But looking at the options, the reagents involve NaNH2, which is a strong base, and things like H2/Pd (hydrogenation), O3 (ozone), etc.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Functionalize the alkyne. Maybe deprotonate and do an alkylation? NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's used for deprotonating the alkyne. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would be an alkylating agent. So, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide with an acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, perhaps adding a methyl group. So, the product would be CH2CH2Cyclohexane? Wait, maybe not. Let's see. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-C≡^- Na^+. Then methyl chloride would provide CH3^+ (but wait, CH3Cl is a methylating agent; in such a reaction, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that would be 1-propynylcyclohexane, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution of the alkyne.

Wait, after alkylation of the acetylide, you would get a longer alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes propynylcyclohexane? Hmm.

Then, looking at the options, the next steps vary. Option A has H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. If you have a triple bond, hydrogenation might reduce it to a single bond. So, propynylcyclohexane would become propylcyclohexane.

But the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps after hydrogenation, the next step is oxidation or some kind of epoxidation.

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps after alkyne modification, we can form a diol or perform some kind of addition.

Another possibility: Maybe the triple bond is transformed into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis would break a triple bond into carbonyl groups. But in the target molecule, there's a formyl group, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps ozonolysis could be involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to create a ketone. Let me think about the steps.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group, and a formyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Hmm, maybe the process is:

- Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group, then perform a Grignard or similar addition.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane under certain conditions could be converted into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. How? Maybe via hydration of the alkyne. But standard hydration of a terminal alkyne gives a ketone, not an aldehyde. Wait, no, hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-) would typically add water across the triple bond, giving either an enol or a ketone, depending on conditions. For example, using H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration catalyst) would produce a ketone, not an aldehyde. So that might not give us the aldehyde we need.

Alternatively, if after alkyne functionalization, we can form a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps after alkyne alkylation, followed by hydrogenation to a single bond, then oxidation.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: 
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, let's see each step:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: as before, this would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes propynylcyclohexane (C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane).

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, propynylcyclohexane becomes propylcyclohexane (CH2CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane).

Wait, propynyl is CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to single, making CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it would become CH2CH2CH2 (since triple to single would add two H2s: C≡C becomes CH2-CH2. So, from C≡C-CH3 to CH2CH2CH3, which is a propyl group.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with (CH3)2S is a standard ozonolysis condition that cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. But wait, in step 2, we had hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane, so no double bond. So this would not work.

Wait, unless in step 2, the hydrogenation is partial, but I don't think so. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol. Hmm, that sounds like forming a metal acetylide, but methanol is a methylating agent? Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base, but when reacted with an alkyne and an alkyl halide, it would form a longer alkyne. Wait, but methanol is not an alkylating agent for acetylides because it's an alcohol. So, perhaps in this case, NaNH2 and methanol could deprotonate the alkyne, but then what? Maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylides, which can then react with alkyl halides. But in option D, the second reagent is methanol, which is not an alkyl halide. So, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended reagent is methyl chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation with NaNH2, then reaction with another reagent, but I'm not sure. Maybe D's step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide.

Then step 2: Li/LiNH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps for deprotonating or for forming alkenes via elimination. Wait, but starting from ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, it's the acetylide. Then step 2 would be treatment with Li/NH3, which might be for elimination. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target molecule is formed via a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropane opening. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl, then subjected to some addition.

Wait, perhaps the pathway involves adding a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. For that, you can use O3 (ozone) but that would require a double bond. Alternatively, maybe using a mercury-based hydration. Wait, if the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then hydrated to a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. Wait, oxidation of terminal alkynes can give carboxylic acids under certain conditions, like with strong oxidizing agents.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2 group and a hydroxyl group, and also a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane, and also a formyl group on the same carbon. So, the structure is:

Main cyclohexane ring with a carbon that has two substituents: one is a CH2OH group connected to another cyclohexane, and the other is a CHO group. So, the same carbon has both a formyl group and a cyclohexyl-CH2OH group.

So, how to get both a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon of a cyclohexane ring. Maybe through a Grignard reaction or a conjugate addition.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenation, then oxidation, then ozonolysis.

Wait, let me think about each option step by step.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes propynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane). But wait, no: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). Treating with NaNH2 deprotonates to cyclohexane-C≡^− Na^+ . Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, now we have a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Adding a methyl via alkylation would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, which is prop-1-ynylcyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, prop-1-ynylcyclohexane becomes propylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone usually cleaves double bonds. But in this step, the compound from step 2 is a single bond, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So this step seems out of place. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete? Or maybe the triple bond is converted into a trans double bond? No, H2 would fully reduce it.

So option C's step 3 doesn't make sense, because there's no double bond to ozonolyze. So perhaps C is incorrect.

Looking at option B:

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, the same as before, but alkylation with ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group. So starting from ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, we'd have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps used for elimination. So, treating the alkyne with Li/NH3 might cause elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn’t make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's deprotonating and creating a more substituted alkyne, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Li/NH3 is used for the formation of alkenes via elimination of a leaving group, but I don't see a leaving group here. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that typically uses Li and NH3 in a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is deprotonating and causing a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the first step gives a longer alkyne, and then step 2 is elimination to form a diene? Not sure. Then step 3 is O3, which would cleave any double bonds formed, and then NH4OH would work up.

But without knowing what's formed after step 2, it's hard to say.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol. Hmm, perhaps the acetylide is formed, and methanol is a proton source? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps methanol is acting as a methylating agent. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in presence of an alkyne and an alcohol, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but I don't see a good leaving group in methanol.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 is forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, NaNH2 in methanol might be a way to deprotonate, but I'm not certain.

Then step 2: Li/liq NH3. Again, same as before. Perhaps for elimination or something else.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, but again, unless there's a double bond, not sure.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, same as before, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to single: gives cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Or perhaps it's used for epoxidation, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction condition, but that's usually with Li and NH3.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the standard Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in some cases to ketones or aldehydes depending on the starting alcohol.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2: maybe for elimination to form an alkene.

4. Jones oxidation: oxidize the alkene to a diol or ketone.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon on a cyclohexane ring. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then performing a reduction to form an alcohol, followed by some kind of oxidation or aldehyde formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves forming a Grignard reagent, adding it to a carbonyl, and then oxidizing.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a carbonyl group first. For that, perhaps using O3 to cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls. But wait, ozonolysis of an alkyne is different from an alkene. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones if the alkyne is internal, but terminal alkynes might give different products.

Wait, if ethynylcyclohexane is treated with ozone, would it cleave into a carbonyl group? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis-alkene first, then ozonized.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Reduce the alkyne to a cis-alkene using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's (but not sure if any options do that).

2. Ozonize the cis-alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

But looking at the options, none directly mention Lindlar's catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 is alkyne alkylation, step 2 is hydrogenation to alkane, step 3 is Ba(OH)2 for elimination to form a double bond, and step 4 is some kind of oxidation.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3. Maybe elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

3. O3/H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but no double bonds are present after step 2, unless Li/NH3 caused elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halogen here. Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is used to form a Grignard-like reagent, but without a halide, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, which would hydrogenate aromatic rings but our starting material is aliphatic.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible reactions in each option.

Looking for the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a carbonyl group (CHO) and a diol, then protecting and deprotecting.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone group. How?

One way to convert a terminal alkyne into a ketone is via hydration, but that usually requires specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe via oxidation. Oxidation of a terminal alkyne can give a carboxylic acid, but that's a COOH group, not a CHO.

Wait, but if we have an alkyne adjacent to a cyclohexane ring, maybe a partial oxidation could give a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cyclopropane via some reaction, then opened to form a carbonyl. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the reagents in the options can help. Let's see:

Option C's steps:

1. Alkyne alkylation to make prop-1-ynylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenation to propylcyclohexane (CH2CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane).

3. O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would need a double bond, but in this case, we have a single bond. So perhaps this step is not applicable. Unless I'm missing something.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Looking for the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group. Perhaps the formyl is introduced via oxidation, and the hydroxymethyl via some addition or substitution.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As before, NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide. Methanol is a polar aprotic solvent? Or maybe it's a methylating agent. Wait, methanol could act as a methylating agent if there's an available proton, but the acetylide is a strong base and would react with methyl chloride, not methanol. So perhaps this step is not alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-type condensation, but that's for esters. Not sure.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used in elimination reactions, possibly for forming alkenes from alkanes, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then attack something. But I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis again, but only if there's a double bond.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the single bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but ozonolysis doesn't act on single bonds. Oh wait, maybe the triple bond is converted into a double bond before ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans double bond, then ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but how to get the double bond. Alternatively, maybe the alkylation step adds a substituent, and then a subsequent elimination creates a double bond.

Let me think about this.

If we have a propargyl group (C≡C-CH2CH3), perhaps we can eliminate H2O or something to form a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, but that's more advanced.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each reagent in each option and see which sequence can produce the target.

The target has:

- cyclohexane ring.

- At position 1: a formyl group (-CHO).

- Also at position 1: a CH2OH group connected to another cyclohexane.

So, two substituents on the same carbon: CHO and CH2-cyclohexanol.

How can this be achieved? Perhaps through a conjugate addition or a cross-aldol addition.

Wait, but the problem is that the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps we can form a ketone from the alkyne, then add a Grignard reagent to form the alcohol, and then oxidize the alcohol to the aldehyde.

Wait, but let me see. Let's imagine:

Step 1: Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, perform a reaction to add a hydroxymethyl group.

But how to get the formyl group. Let's think about the steps.

Alternative plan:

1. Hydrate the alkyne to a ketone. But as I thought earlier, hydration of a terminal alkyne gives a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no. Hydration of ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane) would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (O=CH-Cyclohexane). Wait, but that's not possible because the alkyne is on the cyclohexane. So, hydration would give a ketone, not an aldehyde. Wait, no, for ethynylcyclohexane, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Hydration would add H and OH across the triple bond. H2O adds to give cyclohexane-C(OH)=CH2. Then, acid work-up would protonate and rearrange, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydration would give a ketone, but in that case, the molecule would be cyclohexanone with an additional CH2 group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a bromoalkane, then subjected to a substitution reaction. But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched to form the aldehyde. But I don't see any Mg in the reagents.

Looking back at the options, the reagents don't include Mg, so that's probably not the way.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is synthesized via a conjugate addition to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl first, then a Grignard or organometallic adds to it, forming the alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let's think about the reagents in each option and see what they do.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → propargylcyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → propylcyclohexane.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so this doesn't make sense.

So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → Maybe deprotonation of the alkyne, but without an alkylating agent, I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → Maybe deprotonation or elimination.

Step3: O3 and (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, but again, needs a double bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation with ethyl chloride → longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a trans-alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → break the double bond into carbonyls.

Step4: NH4OH → work up, perhaps to form carbonyls.

Wait, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. For example, cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2CH2 becomes something with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Option A:

Step1: Alkyne alkylation with methyl chloride → longer alkyne.

Step2: H2/Pd → alkane.

Step3: Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

Step4: Jones oxidation → oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but maybe under certain conditions, it can oxidize to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps after step 3, a double bond is formed, and step4 oxidizes it to a carbonyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each reagent's role.

In Ba(OH)2, it's a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, there's no halogen. Alternatively, it might be used for epoxidation, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: After hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide, but again, I don't see the relevance.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then Ba(OH)2 is used to form a diol via acid-catalyzed hydration, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products of each option.

Looking for the target molecule, which has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane.

Looking at option D:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-OMe? No, because step 1 uses methanol. Or maybe it's deprotonated, but without an electrophilic reagent, I don't see the alkylation.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is forming an acetylide, then step 2 is doing something else. But I'm not clear.

Alternative approach: Maybe the correct sequence is to first alkylation of the alkyne, then hydrogenation to an alkane, then Ba(OH)2 to form an epoxide, then some other reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Alkyne alkylation (add methyl group).

2. Hydrogenation to alkane.

3. Ozonolysis → but no, because no double bond.

So, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH, which suggests that perhaps an epoxide ring-opening could form that group. But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reagent adds to form the alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, but I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options. The options have reagents like NaNH2, H2, O3, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe through a metal-catalyzed addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But again, without a double bond, ozonolysis doesn’t make sense.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about which option produces the necessary functional groups.

The target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. How can we get an aldehyde from the starting material? One way is via oxidation of a primary alcohol. Alternatively, via partial oxidation of a ketone, but that's not straightforward.

Looking at the options, after some steps, the reagents like H2SO4 and HgSO4 (option A) are Jones reagents, which are strong oxidizing agents. So, if in option A, after step 3, there's an alcohol, step 4 could oxidize it to a ketone or aldehyde.

But in option A, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination or for dehydrohalogenation, but without a leaving group, that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps in option A:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes longer.

Step 2: Alkyne becomes alkane.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond.

Step 4: Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but if there's a secondary alcohol, it would become a ketone. If there's a primary alcohol, it would become COOH, but perhaps in some cases, it can be controlled to form an aldehyde.

But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation.

2. Reduce alkyne to alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2: maybe form a diol.

4. Jones oxidation: oxidize primary diol to something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps in option C, after step 3, the molecule has a carbonyl group from ozonolysis. But earlier steps don't seem to form a double bond, so I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let me think about the target molecule's structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group, and also a formyl group at the same position. So, the same carbon has both CHO and CH2OH connected to a cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group to the same carbon. One way to do this is through a conjugate addition or through a double elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard or organometallic adds twice to the same carbon, once for the formyl and once for the hydroxymethyl. But I don't see the Grignard reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl via ozonolysis, then a dienophile is added. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's see:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation → propargylcyclohexane.

Step 2: Hydrogenation → propylcyclohexane.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → but without a double bond, nothing happens.

Hmm, not helpful.

Option D:

After step 1, NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the acetylide is treated with methanol, but how? Methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Perhaps it's a different reaction, like a nucleophilic substitution, but the alkyne is a good leaving group? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form a ketone. Wait, no, quenching an acetylide with water gives a carboxylic acid. Quenching with alcohol might give an ether, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should make a guess based on the available options and the steps that make sense.

Looking at the steps, option C has ozonolysis after hydrogenation, which doesn't make sense. Option B's step 3 is ozonolysis but without a double bond. Option D's step 3 is ozonolysis but same issue.

Option A's steps:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2—maybe eliminate to form a double bond.

4. Jones oxidation.

Wait, perhaps in option A, step3 is elimination to form a double bond, then in step4, oxidation of the double bond.

But Jones oxidation usually oxidizes alcohols, not alkenes. Oh wait, but if there's an alcohol adjacent to a double bond, perhaps it's oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination (step3), we have a diene or an alkene, which upon oxidation (step4) forms a diol or a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and after step1, it's alkylated to propargylcyclohexane.

Step2: hydrogenated to propylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3).

Step3: Ba(OH)2. Perhaps this is used for epoxidation, but I don't think so. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that can induce elimination, perhaps leading to the formation of a double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3 could eliminate to form cyclohexane-CH2CH2, but that's not correct because elimination would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is longer, allowing for elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in step3 could deprotonate and cause elimination, forming cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH=CH2 + something. Wait, no, that's not possible because there's no leaving group. Unless the hydrogenation step produces a bromide, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. But I'm not certain.

If after step3, a double bond is formed, then step4 (Jones oxidation) would oxidize the double bond. But Jones reagent oxidizes alcohols, not alkenes, so that's a problem.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is synthesized via a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl.

But how to form the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the formyl group. It must come from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne into an alcohol.

2. Then, introduce a cyclohexyl group to the same carbon.

3. Oxidize the alcohol to aldehyde.

But how to do that with the given reagents.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via hydration, then one of the hydroxyl groups is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkane.

3. Ozonolysis, but without a double bond, it doesn't work.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, another thought: Looking at the target molecule, the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2OH group. How can we form a CH2OH group? One way is through epoxide ring-opening with water, but I'm not sure if that's involved here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives an alcohol. But I don't see how that would happen with the given reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkane.

3. Ozonolysis: but no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me re-examine option B's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer, maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li, liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a trans-alkene. So, cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2CH=CH2.

Wait, but that's a stretch because elimination usually requires a leaving group, which isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is used for deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then attack something. Not sure.

Step3: O3/H2O → would cleave any double bonds into carbonyls. So, if step2 forms a double bond, step3 would break it.

Then step4: NH4OH → work-up, perhaps to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's steps form a diketone, which then can undergo some addition.

Wait, but the target has a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon. I'm not seeing the connection.

At this point, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Looking at the options, the only one that includes a formyl group via oxidation is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again:

Option C:

1. Alkyne alkylation → propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → propylcyclohexane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

Hmm, but that's a problem. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

Step1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms a different structure.

Step2: Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination.

Step3: O3 → cleaves any double bonds.

Step4: NH4OH → work up.

But without knowing what's formed in step2, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think:

In option D, after step1, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and reacts with methanol to form an ether or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step1 is forming a Grignard-like reagent, but without Mg, that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is option C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves evaluating the sequence of reagents and their potential to achieve the target molecule. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane and a formyl group (-CHO) on the same carbon.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne of ethynylcyclohexane and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne (propargylcyclohexane).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding propylcyclohexane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially used for elimination or oxidation, but its exact role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or primary aldehydes. However, the sequence leading to the formyl group and hydroxymethyl group is ambiguous.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the terminal alkyne with an ethyl group, forming a longer alkyne (but-1-ynylcyclohexane).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up reagent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the terminal alkyne, forming propargylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding propylcyclohexane.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne, but methanol is not a typical alkylating agent, making the reaction unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is ambiguous.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up reagent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that none of the options clearly and directly achieve the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary functional groups, despite ambiguities in the sequence.
