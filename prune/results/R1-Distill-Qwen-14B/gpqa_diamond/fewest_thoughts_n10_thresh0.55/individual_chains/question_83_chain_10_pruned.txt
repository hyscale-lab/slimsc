Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms the acetate ion. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

First, let me outline what I need to do:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.
3. For each of these points (25% and equivalence), calculate the pH.

Starting with the first part: Diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 = 40. So dilution is involved here.

I think I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L (20 cm³). V2 is 0.040 L (40 cm³). So M2 = (M1V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so moles = M * V. At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. So V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

25% titration would be a quarter of that, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Actually, 25% titration refers to the percentage of the acid that's been neutralized. So 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. Right.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ NaOH has been added.

Now I need to calculate the pH at both 25% and equivalence points.

Starting with the 25% point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. So this is a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be applicable here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

First, find pKa. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is about 4.733.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. The log of 1.85 is approximately 0.267, so the pKa is 4.7
