Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, with different power laws.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So the smaller the parallax, the farther away the star is.

Now, the question assumes stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably in space, so the number density of stars is the same everywhere. Or maybe uniformly distributed in the sky, but I think it's more about the three-dimensional distribution because parallax depends on distance.

Wait, the number per unit range of parallax. Let me think about how many stars you'd observe at a certain parallax. Parallax ranges from 0 to some maximum value (like for the nearest stars). But if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant. So I need to relate this to the parallax.

Parallax (in arcseconds) is given by plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. But how does this translate to parallax?

Let me model this. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with radius dr would be 4πd² dr. Because the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars in this shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, let's see: d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Because as plx increases, d decreases. So the thickness in d is related to the change in plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So maybe we can express the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx.

Wait, maybe I should express dN, the number of stars, in terms of plx.

Given that d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since parallax increases as distance decreases, perhaps I can express the number of stars in terms of plx.

Alternatively, since the number of stars in a volume element is n*dV, and dV is 4πd² dd. But if I change variables from d to plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

dN = n * 4π d² dd = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx², and dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. So putting it all together:

dN = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (- 1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but that would be:

dN = -4 π n (1/plx
