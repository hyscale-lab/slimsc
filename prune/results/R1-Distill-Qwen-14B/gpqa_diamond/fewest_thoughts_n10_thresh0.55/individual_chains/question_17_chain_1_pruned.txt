Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. In this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is already present in solution, so the problem is about dissociating that complex into free Ca²+ ions.

Wait, so the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. Since the complex is dissociating, the reaction would be something like:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴−

The formation constant (K) is given, but wait, formation constants are usually for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the formation constant K would be [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]). But in this problem, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex, so the dissociation constant would be the inverse of the formation constant. Oh right, because K for dissociation would be 1/K_form.

So K_dissociation = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the given K is the formation constant, which is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]). So for the dissociation, the equilibrium would have Kd = 1/Kf = 2x10^-11.

But wait, let's think about the setup. When the complex dissociates, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²−. Let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, at equilibrium, [CaY²−] would be approximately 0.02 - x, but since K is very small (because Kf is very large
