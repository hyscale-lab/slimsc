Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about titration, which I remember is when you add a solution to another to see how much is needed to reach a chemical change, like a neutralization. The question is about acetic acid being titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. Diluting it would decrease the concentration because the same amount of moles is spread out more.

Wait, what's the initial concentration after dilution? Let me calculate that. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity times Volume. Oh wait, wait—the volume is in cm³, which is milliliters. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After diluting with 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, that makes sense because when you double the volume (from 20 to 40), the concentration halves. So from 0.05 to 0.025 M.

Now, the problem says we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part asks for the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First part: 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of what? The equivalence point volume, I think. So we need to find out how much NaOH is added when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + Na
