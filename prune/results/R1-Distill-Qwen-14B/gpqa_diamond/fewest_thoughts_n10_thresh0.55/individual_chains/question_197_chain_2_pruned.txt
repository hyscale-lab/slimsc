Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are reagents used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe it's more about the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Or wait, no, wait, another reaction. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but more commonly, the Beckmann rearrangement? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, another possibility is that these reagents are used in the elimination reaction for producing alkenes, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! That's the reaction where a nitrile is hydrolyzed to an amide, but wait, no—wait, nitrile hydrolysis with H2O and acid usually gives a carboxylic acid, but with red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different pathway. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but esters usually hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. Red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a specific condition for breaking certain functional groups.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Because I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to give carboxylic acids. So if the reagents are HI and P, it's a way to get the acid from the nitrile.

So, the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. Because the product of the reaction of X with these reagents is what we're looking for.

Looking at the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X.

IR data: Peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an -OH stretch or possibly an alkyne or an amine. But in this case, since after reaction with HI, we're getting a product that might be an acid (looking at the options), perhaps the starting material has a nitrile group. Wait, but nitriles have IR absorption around 2250 cm-1. Oh, but the IR given doesn't show a peak around there. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, looking again: The major IR peaks are at 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, 1450. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid). But since the product is formed by hydrolysis, maybe X is an ester. Because esters can hydrolyze with acid to form carboxylic acids.

Wait, but if X is an ester, its IR would show an ester carbonyl around 1720-1740, which matches. So that fits. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring.

So looking at the NMR data for X:

1H NMR: Let's break it down.

10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong downfield shift, possibly an aldehyde proton or an acidic proton like an -OH or an alpha proton to a carbonyl. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but that's a broad signal. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group, but an -OH in an acid would be around that region. But wait, if X is an ester, maybe the ester has an acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, wait. Another thought: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet. Broad suggests it's exchanging, like an -OH group. But in an ester, there's no -OH except maybe in a carboxylic ester? Wait, no—ester groups have an -O- attached to R, not an -OH. So maybe that peak isn't from an -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. If the compound has an aldehyde proton, that would appear at around 9-10 ppm. But aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10, but more deshielded (like 9.5-10) for aromatic aldehydes.

Wait, but if X is an ester, perhaps it's an aromatic ester. Let me think about the other signals.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two doublets of 2H each. So, similar to a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). Let me visualize this.

The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a ethyl group (CH2CH3). The 1.4 doublet (3H) must be a CH(CH3) group. Because a doublet for 3H would imply that the neighboring group is a CH that has two other groups, perhaps a CH2.

Wait, so the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So, something like CH(CH3)2? Or wait, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3). Let me think: the triplet at 0.9 is a terminal CH2CH3. Then, the 1.7ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH that's adjacent to another CH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe it's a butyl group. Let's see. So, 0.9 t (3H) is the end of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 d (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is
