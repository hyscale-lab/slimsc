Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are A, B, C, D, which are all cyclic ketones.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think I should start by analyzing each reaction step and what it tells me about the structure of each compound.

First, the reaction between Compound A and HCN gives Compound B. HCN is typically used in the formation of cyanohydrins when reacting with ketones. So maybe Compound A is a ketone, and B is a cyanohydrin.

Then, Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst used in hydrogenation, so perhaps the reduction is of a nitrile group to an amine? Wait, but HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a cyanide group. If B is a cyanohydrin, then reduction could convert the nitrile group (-CN) into an amine (-CH2NH2?), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is hydrogenolysis of the nitrile, but I'm not sure about that. Another thought: perhaps the reduction is of a double bond. Wait, but if B has a double bond, then the reduction would add hydrogen. But wait, B is from A and HCN. Let me think again.

Wait, if A is a ketone, then HCN adds to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. The structure of the cyanohydrin would be a diol with a nitrile group attached. Wait, no, actually, the cyanohydrin is an alcohol and a nitrile on adjacent carbons. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, then B would be cyclohexane with an OH and CN groups on adjacent carbons.

Then, Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so maybe the nitrile group is being reduced. Nitrile reduction typically gives a primary amine. So if B has a CN group, then C would have a CH2NH2 group. But that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the reduction could be of the alcohol group. Wait, the alcohol is an -OH. When you reduce an alcohol, you can get a primary amine, but that usually requires a more specific catalyst like Raney Ni or other conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in
