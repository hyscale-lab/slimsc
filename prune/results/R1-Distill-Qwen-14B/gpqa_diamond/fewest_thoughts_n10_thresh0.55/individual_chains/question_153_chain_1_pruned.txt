Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question has three parts, but I'll tackle them one by one. Let's start with part (A): the reaction of dimethyl malonate with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol).

Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically an enolate ion, right? So the enolate would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

In this case, the reagents are NaOEt and EtOH. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form the enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good source of the enolate because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When treated with a base, it forms a conjugate base, which is a strong nucleophile.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the p-tolyl group is at the 3 position? No, wait, the formula is probably CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl? Or maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl with an ester group. Wait, noâ€”acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but I'll proceed.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The enolate is a strong nucleophile, and it adds to the less substituted carbon because of the geometry. Wait, the E geometry means that the substituents are opposite each other. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached where? Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)O-p-tolyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH-p-tolyl with the double bond being between C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as:

E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond and a p-tolyl group on the second carbon. Maybe I should look at the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the central carbon? No, that would make it CH2-p-tolyl-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that's not an acrylate. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

So, regardless of the exact structure, the Michael addition typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta position of the acceptor.

So dimethyl malonate (CH2(CO2Me)2) would form the enolate, which is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the beta position (the CH2 group adjacent to the
