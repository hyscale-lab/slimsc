Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. But wait, what exactly is regularization? I think it's a way to make those infinities manageable so you can subtract them off or renormalize the theory. 

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. So I need to look at each option and see if they have divergences that require this technique.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which I believe is a quantum theory of gravity. String theories aim to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. Do they have divergences? I think string theories, especially superstring theory, are background-dependent and might have issues like the infinite tension of the string. But wait, in string theory, the concept of regularization isn't the same as in QFT. Or do they use something like T-duality or other methods to deal with high energy issues? Maybe in superstring theory, the theory is finite and doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs. I'm not too sure about this one.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. Since it's a gauge theory, it's a QFT and would typically have loop divergences. I remember that QCD requires renormalization, which involves regularization. But wait, there's a thing called asymptotic freedom where at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative calculations feasible. But does that mean QCD doesn't need regularization? No, because regularization is part of the renormalization process regardless of the energy scale. So QCD would still require regularization even if it's easier to handle at high energies.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established QFT and definitely has divergences. For example, the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These are handled through regularization and renormalization. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So CE doesn't deal with things like renormalization because
