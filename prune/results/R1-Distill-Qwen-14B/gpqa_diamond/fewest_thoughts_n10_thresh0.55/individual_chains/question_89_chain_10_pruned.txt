Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question involves several reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me jot down what each step does.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. That's a pretty high temperature, so I'm thinking elimination or dehydrohalogenation might be happening here. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps eliminating both to form a diene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms in positions 1 and 3. If they eliminate, the structure would lose two HBr molecules. So the product would probably be adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but wait, that might not be possible because of the structure of adamantane. Or maybe it's a single elimination but with two bromines. Hmm.

Wait, wait, I think when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) are treated with strong base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Oh, but perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each carbon bonded to three carbons. So each carbon in adamantane has three C-C bonds. For 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure.

Wait, when KOH is used, especially in a high temperature, it's likely an E2 elimination. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So perhaps each Br leaves, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, elimination reactions typically involve the removal of two substituents (like H and X) from adjacent carbons. So if the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon. Wait, but 1
