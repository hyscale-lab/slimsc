Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details here.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices combine these in different ways.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations of spacetime. So Poincare implies Lorentz, right? So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. Similarly, if it respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? No, because Poincare includes more than just Lorentzâ€”like translations. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz, but do they have to respect Poincare as well?

Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's built from local operators. Local symmetry implies that the theory respects diffeomorphisms, which includes Poincare? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because all the terms in the Standard Model are Lorentz-invariant, so the effective theory would be as well. So operators must respect Lorent
