Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. The options are given, and there are some hints and reaction steps to consider.

First, let me read through the reaction scheme carefully.

Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to give D, and then D eliminates an inert gas to become E.

Hmm, also, there are some hints. Hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Oh wait, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. So the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that compound, then A must have a carbonyl group. Because the Wittig reagent typically reacts with aldehydes or ketones.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)= something. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring, with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups. And position 4 has a substituent that's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a methylene group attached to a CH(CH3)2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think. The ylide is typically something like Ph3P=CH-R. So when it reacts, it replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the CH-R group.

Wait, no. The product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The ylide has a structure like Ph3P=CH-CH(CH3)2 perhaps? Or maybe the propan-2-ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)=, but I'm not sure. Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2 positions. At 4 position, there's a propan-2-ylidene substituent. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, so like CH2-C(CH3)= something. Wait, actually, the structure is a cyclopentane ring, with substituents at 1 (Me), 2 (Me), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and position 4 has a group that's an alkenyl group. Because the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So the propan-2-ylidene group would imply a double bond between C2 and C3 of a propyl chain. So maybe the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the cyclopentane at position 4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that, but I think the main point is that A is a ketone or aldehyde. Because the Wittig reaction uses carbonyls.

Now, looking at hint b: The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is a carbonyl-containing compound, probably a ketone or aldehyde.

The IR of E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1. That's also a carbonyl, but perhaps a ketone again, but maybe less substituted? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Now, let's go through the reactions step by step.

1. A + HCN â†’ B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be cyclohexanone cyanohydrin, which would have an OH and CN group on adjacent carbons.

2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are for hydrogenation. So the carbonyl groups in B would be reduced. Wait, B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group. So when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the nitrile (CN) group would be reduced to CH2NH2, but wait, no, under hydrogenation with Pd, usually nitriles are hydrogenated to amines. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Pd and H2 would reduce the nitrile to
