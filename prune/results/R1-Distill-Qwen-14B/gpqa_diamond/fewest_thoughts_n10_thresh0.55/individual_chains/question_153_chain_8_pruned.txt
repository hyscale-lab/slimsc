Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I'll need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a enolate equivalent. The structure of dimethyl malonate is O=C(CO2Me)2. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure should be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OAc? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me attached to the p-tolyl group. No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But the substituent is at the 3 position, so maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-p-tol
