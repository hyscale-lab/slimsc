Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So, the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a particle X, which is a meson resonance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances in meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I'm vaguely recalling is something like distance = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I get tau from the given width Γ?

Oh right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is given by the uncertainty principle: tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, what's the exact relation? I think Γ has units of energy, so when you take ħ in units of GeV·s, you can get the time. Let me see. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV; I need to convert it to GeV. 320
