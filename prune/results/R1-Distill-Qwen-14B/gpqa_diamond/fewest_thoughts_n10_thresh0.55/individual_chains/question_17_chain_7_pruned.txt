Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem also gives me the formation constant, Kca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't think I need to worry about pH affecting the EDTA's protonation state or anything like that.

Hmm, right. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. I think that means the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in solution.

I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant (Kf) comes into play. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Wait, but in reality, EDTA is often in different protonated forms depending on the pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I think I can assume that the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y^4-, so the reaction is as I wrote above.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, what is the initial concentration of EDTA and calcium before they form the complex? Oh, but the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, which implies that all the Ca and EDTA are in the form of the complex. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you have a solution of the complex, that's the only species present initially. So the total concentration of Ca and EDTA in the solution is 0.02 M each? Wait, no—wait, the complex is made of one Ca and one EDTA, so the concentration of
