Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, normalization is when the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we don't know the normalization factor yet. Let me calculate the norm of this vector.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Let's calculate each term. |1+i| squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 - i| squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because sqrt(7) squared is 7. So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem asks about measuring the probability of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's an interesting matrix. Let me think about what that looks like in 2x2 space because |up> and |down> are the basis states.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, that looks like the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is (ħ/2) * X. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are the same as the eigenstates of the operator here, right? Because it's a multiple of σ_x.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? They are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So the operator whose matrix is A_ij has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues? Let me see the matrix: since it's (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues should be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

But wait, the problem asks for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So we need
