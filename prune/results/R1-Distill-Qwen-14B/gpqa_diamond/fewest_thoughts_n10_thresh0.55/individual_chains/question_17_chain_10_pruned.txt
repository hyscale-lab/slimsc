Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion, so the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something like that. Wait, maybe it's Ca²+ + EDTA^2- → CaEDTA^0? No, wait, I think the charge depends on the form. EDTA is usually in different forms based on pH, but the problem says pH is ideal, so perhaps it's in its most common form for chelation.

The key here is the formation constant, K. I think K is the formation constant for the complex. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

But wait, some sources say that the formation constant is written as Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the K given is 5e10. So yeah, that must be the formation constant.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Because the complex is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but in solution, the complex can dissociate. So the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is given, which is 5e10. But wait, Kf is for the formation, so the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf. Because Kd = 1/K
