Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1 over parallax^5. So mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5, right?

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, they want to know the change per unit range of distance, r. So, I think they're asking for the relationship between N and r, and how N depends on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. Like, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if d increases, plx decreases. Oh wait, but in the question, N is proportional to 1/plx^5, so substituting plx as 1/d, that would make N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think it's about the differential relationship. Like, how does N change as r (distance) changes. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with r (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^4? Or wait, maybe I'm thinking about that wrong
