Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. So, it's about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on its surface affecting the temperature and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait, does that mean the temperature of the spots is lower? Because spots are usually cooler regions.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are A to D, and the transition wavelength is about 1448 Angstroms. LTE is assumed, so local thermodynamic equilibrium holds.

Right, in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So without spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K, and when it's spotted, it's 5500 K. But wait, is the entire photosphere at 5500 K when 40% is covered? Or is part of the surface at a lower temperature (spots) and the rest at 6000 K?

Hmm, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think the entire photosphere is being treated as an average. But that might not be correct. Because when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, and the rest is at a higher temperature. So the overall emitted flux would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. Oh
