Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. I remember that in special relativity, when objects move, their velocities don't just add up linearly because of the speed limit c. But wait, is this a relativistic problem or a classical one?

The options include 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But glass has an index of refraction, so normally light slows down in glass. The speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? So in the glass, without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect it?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the frame of reference here. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, how does the light's speed appear?

I remember something about the velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's when you're transforming from a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in this
