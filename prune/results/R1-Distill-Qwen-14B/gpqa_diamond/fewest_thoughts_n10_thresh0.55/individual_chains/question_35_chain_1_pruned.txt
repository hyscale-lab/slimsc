Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. They told us that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second is (i, 0). So, let me write that matrix S down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), then each element of S is multiplied by this constant.

The problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let me compute the matrix Ay. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -(h/(4π))i], [ (h/(4π))i, 0 ] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - aI would be:

[ [ -a, -(h/(4π))i ],
  [ (h/(4π))i, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ -(h/(4π))i * (h/(4π))i ].

So determinant = a² - [ (h/(4π))^2 * i^2 ]

But i squared is -1, so determinant = a² + (h^2/(16π²)).

Set determinant to zero:

a² + (h²/(16π²)) = 0 → a² = - h²/(16π² )

Taking square roots, a = ± (h/(4π)) * i? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the determinant is (a²) minus [ (h/(4π) i)(h/(4π) i) ) ] times (-1) because the off-diagonal terms are negative in the matrix.

Wait, let me recalculate. The determinant is (Ay - aI) determinant:

The (1,1) element is -a, (1,2) is -(h/(4π)) i.

The (2,1) is (h/(4π)) i, and (2,2) is -a.

So determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ ( - (h/(4π)i) ) * ( (h/(4π)) i ) ) ]

So determinant = a² - [ ( - (h/(4π)i) ) * (h/(4π)i) ) ]

Calculating the product: (- (h/(4π)i)) * (h/(4π)i) = - (h^2/(16π²)) i^2.

But i^2 is -1, so this becomes - (h^2/(16π²)) (-1) ) = h²/(16π²).

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²/(16π²)) ] = 0.

Therefore, a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but earlier I thought I got i, but that's not the case. Because when I calculated the determinant correctly, I didn't have i terms. Oh right, because when you compute the product, i squared becomes -1, which then changes the sign.

So the eigenvalues are real numbers: a = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the
