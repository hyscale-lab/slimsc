Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that the model combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about a diatomic molecule, which is made of two atoms, X and Y. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the quantum models, sometimes the states are quantized in different ways. I'm a bit confused about whether it's the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. Oh wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So probably, the photon is providing the energy to excite the molecule to the next higher energy state. But I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. So the transition might involve both.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in its ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state. Or maybe the next state is a higher vibrational state with the same rotational state. Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the transition is for the vibrational state because the rotational states have their own spacing, which is usually smaller than vibrational.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, w. So perhaps the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational energy difference. Because in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotor is treated as a non-rigid body, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels. Maybe for this problem, the key is the vibrational energy transition.

So, the energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator (vibrational model) are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0. The next possible state would be v=1. So the energy difference ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = (1 + 1/2 - 0 -1/2) h w = h w.

So the photon's energy must be equal to h w. But wait, the problem is about momentum, not energy. So the energy of the photon is h f = p c, where p is the momentum. Because E = p c for photons. So ΔE = h w = p c → p = h w / c.

But wait, what's the relation
