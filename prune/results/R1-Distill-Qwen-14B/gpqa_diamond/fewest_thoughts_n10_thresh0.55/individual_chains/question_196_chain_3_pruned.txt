Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, relativity probably changes things because at high speeds, you can't ignore relativistic effects.

The system is a 1D harmonic oscillator, so it's just moving back and forth on a line. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law, so it's a spring. The maximum amplitude is A, and the mass is m. The speed of light is c, so we're probably dealing with some sort of gamma factor here.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but I'm not sure if that's correct here because the problem is relativistic. So I'll probably have to consider relativistic energy equations.

Wait, the total energy in relativity isn't just kinetic plus potential like in the classical case. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy, but wait, no, in this case, the oscillator's potential is due to the spring, so maybe the total mechanical energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic and potential.

Wait, but wait, the potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx², but that's in the
