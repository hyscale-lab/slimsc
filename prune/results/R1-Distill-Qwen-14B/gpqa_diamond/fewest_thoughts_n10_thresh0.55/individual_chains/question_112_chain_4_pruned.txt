Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |alpha> is a linear combination of the eigenstates |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I think that means |up> and |down> are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems, right? So, |up> corresponds to spin up along z, and |down> is spin down along z.

The first part of the question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and for the X matrix, the off-diagonal elements are 1 and the diagonal are 0. So, A must be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the X operator. Those are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues (ħ/2) and -(ħ/2), respectively.

So, to find the probabilities of measuring the system in each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the basis of |+x> and |-x>. Then, the square of the coefficients will give me the probabilities.

But wait, first I need to normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, let's compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of each coefficient.

The coefficient for |up> is
