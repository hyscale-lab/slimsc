Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory (EFT) that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve. But in EFTs, especially SMEFT, certain symmetries must be preserved because they're part of the underlying theory's structure.

Wait, what's the deal with Lorentz symmetry? I think Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental part of the Standard Model, so any operator in SMEFT must respect it. Operators are built from the SM fields, which are Lorentz-invariant, so the operators themselves should be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Wait, but in EFTs, especially when considering the effective theory, do we always have Poincare symmetry? Or does the effective theory handle it differently? I'm a bit confused here. SMEFT is constructed in a way that it's a low-energy effective theory, so I think it's still based on Poincare symmetry. So operators should respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

CP symmetry (3): Hmm, the Standard Model doesn't have a fundamental CP symmetry, but I think that in SMEFT, the operators are not necessarily CP-invariant. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The SMEFT operators are constructed to be renormalizable-like, but the SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, right? For example, the QCD axion models or other beyond-the-SM physics can violate CP. So the SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So probably 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry (4): Now, CPT is a big one. I remember that in all Lorentz-invariant theories, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, and given that it
