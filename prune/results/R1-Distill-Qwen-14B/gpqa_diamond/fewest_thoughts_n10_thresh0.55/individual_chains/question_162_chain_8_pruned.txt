Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, and sometimes they have singularities or special properties.

First, I need to figure out what kind of space this metric represents. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². That reminds me of the metric for a sphere. Oh wait, the standard metric for a sphere in 2D is something like (dr² + r² dθ²), but this is in terms of x and y. Alternatively, maybe it's related to a hyperbolic space? Because sometimes denominators change signs.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me see, 4 is like a radius squared if the radius is 2. So 4 - x² - y² = (2)^2 - (x² + y²). So when x² + y² <4, the denominator is positive, and when it's greater than 4, it's negative. So the metric changes signature depending on the region.

So the space described by this metric would have different signatures in different regions. For r² = x² + y² <4, the metric is (positive, positive) because both dx² and dy² are multiplied by a positive factor. But when
