Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, which causes a dip in brightness. But how do I calculate the probability of that happening?

The question says both planets have the same mass. Wait, but they're Earth-like, so maybe their radii are similar? Oh, but the host stars' radii are the same. Both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have the same size. Interesting.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, since shorter period means closer orbit. Oh right, using Kepler's third law, which relates period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star.

Wait, the probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula I remember is that the probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, I might be mixing it up. Or is it (R_star) / a, assuming the planet's size is much smaller than the star's? Well, since both stars have the same radius and the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than the stars, so maybe we can approximate it as R_star / a.

Wait, but waitâ€”the probability isn't just R/a, right? Because it's more about the geometry. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that
