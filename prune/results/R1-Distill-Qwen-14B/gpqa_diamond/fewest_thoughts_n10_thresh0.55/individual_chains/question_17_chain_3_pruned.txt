Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The solution has 0.02 M of that complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, each with different concentrations.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms a complex with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a big number when the complex is stable. So a high K means the complex is strongly formed. Right.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the formula for the complex would be something like CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the complex is CaEDTA^2-.

But wait, what's the stoichiometry? I think it's a 1:1 ratio. So each calcium ion binds with one EDTA molecule. So the formula is CaY^2-.

Now, the concentration of the solution is 0.02 M of this complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

But the question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in solution. Because the EDTA is complexing the calcium, the free calcium concentration should be low.

I remember the formation constant K is given by the formula:

K = [
