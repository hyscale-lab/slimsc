Okay, so I have this problem about the density matrix of a qubit and I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = ½ (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in the computational basis. The |0> and |1> states are orthonormal, so when I expand them, |0><0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 in (1,1). Adding them together and dividing by 2, each diagonal element becomes ½ and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix ρ looks like:

[ [½, 0],
  [0, ½] ]

Wait, what's the geometrical position of a density matrix in qubit space? I think that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside the unit sphere. For pure states, the vector is on the surface; mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector (r) is related to the density matrix. For a general 2x2 density matrix ρ, it can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Let me write that out: ρ = [I + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)] / 2.

So comparing this to the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[½, 0],[0, ½]]. That's the same as I/2 because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is exactly ρ.

Now, setting ρ equal to (I + r·σ)/2. Let's see what r would be. If ρ is I/2, then:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ

Subtract I: 0 = r·σ

Which implies that r·σ = 0. So the vector r must satisfy this condition. Let me think about the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

The dot product r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So setting this equal to zero matrix:

r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]

Looking at each element:

Top-left: r_z = 0
Top-right: r_x - i r_y = 0
Bottom-left: r_x + i r_y = 0
Bottom-right: -r_z = 0 → same as top-left, so r_z=0.

From top-right: r_x = i r_y. But r_x and r_y are real numbers because r is a real vector in the Bloch sphere. Wait, because σ_x and σ_y are imaginary in their off-diagonal terms, but r_x and r_y are real. So r_x - i r_y = 0 implies that r_x =0 and r_y=0. Because the only way a real number minus i times a real number equals zero is if both are zero.

So r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0
