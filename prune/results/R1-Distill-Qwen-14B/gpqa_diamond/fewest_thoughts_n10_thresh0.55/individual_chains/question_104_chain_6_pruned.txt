Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, and we can detect that movement by looking at shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like:

v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) and the orbital parameters. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * π) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, maybe it's easier to use the proportionality here. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and both planets have similar masses (like Neptune), the mass terms (M_p) and (M_star) can be considered the same for both planets.

So, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. Because, looking at the formula, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (constant) / P1^(1
