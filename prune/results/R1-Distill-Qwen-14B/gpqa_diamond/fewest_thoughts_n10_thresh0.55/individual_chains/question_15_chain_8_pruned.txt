Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital distance.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly, right?

Wait, but wait, the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the masses of the planets are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M+m ≈ M. So, the planet with a shorter period has a smaller semi-major axis. So Planet_1 is closer in.

Their host stars have the same radius, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. So Star_1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive but same radius as Star_2 (Planet_2's star).

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like R_planet / R_star times something else. Oh wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² divided by (a) something. Or wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital plane orientation to our line of sight. Oh, right, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a)². Or wait, wait, what's the exact formula?

Wait, I think the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s)))^2. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² * (R_s / a)^2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The transit probability depends on the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is approximately (R_p + R
