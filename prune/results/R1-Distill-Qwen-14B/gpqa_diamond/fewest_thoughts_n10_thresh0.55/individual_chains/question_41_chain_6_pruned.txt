Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving. I remember that when objects move at relativistic speeds, you have to consider special relativity, but since the problem doesn't specify any speeds close to the speed of light, maybe we can treat it with classical physics. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by n, right? Because the refractive index n is c over the speed in the medium. So normally, the speed v_glass would be c/n. But here, the glass itself is moving, so the observer's frame is different.

So I think this is a problem where I need to account for the motion of the medium (glass) and how that affects the observed speed of light within the glass. I remember something about Galilean transformations when velocities are much less than c.

Galilean velocity addition says that if an object has velocity u in a frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity in S' is u' = u - v.
