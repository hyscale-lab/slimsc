Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about a reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride. I'm supposed to find the major product from the given options.

First, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. Dienophiles react with dienes in a Diels-Alder reaction. So, the reaction here is likely a Diels-Alder between the diene and the dienophile.

Wait, what's a diene? A diene is a molecule with two double bonds, or more accurately, a conjugated system of two double bonds. But wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has two double bonds. So that's our diene part. The dienophile is maleic anhydride, which has a good electron-deficient double bond.

The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. The diene gets the new sigma bonds on the ends of its conjugated system, and the dienophile forms the other two. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene derivative, with substituents from the dienophile in the endo position, typically.

But wait, the diene here is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me draw that structure mentally. Cyclopent
