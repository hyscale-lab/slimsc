Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, and this is a relativistic problem. 

The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass I can look up.

I think the formula for the energy of a relativistic particle involves the gamma factor. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, which is m*c². So E = gamma * m * c².

But wait, the speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to find gamma for that speed. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

Plugging in v = 0.96c, so v² is (0.96c)². Let's compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think, sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28*0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. What's 1 divided by 0.28? Let's see, 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy m*c² for Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. I
