Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The general formula I think is distance = velocity * lifetime. So first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson.

Oh right, the lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle, the width Γ (which is the uncertainty in energy) is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, is Γ the same as the total decay width? I think so because Γ is given as the width of the resonance, which should be the total decay width. So yes, using that relation.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The velocity can be found from its energy and mass. The meson isn't at rest, right? It's produced with some energy, so I should calculate its velocity based on energy.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but wait: E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So γ = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666... So γ is 6.666... approximately.

The velocity v can be found from γ. The relation between γ and v is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Rearranging that, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that. Since γ is about 6.666, 1/γ² is (1/44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.97
