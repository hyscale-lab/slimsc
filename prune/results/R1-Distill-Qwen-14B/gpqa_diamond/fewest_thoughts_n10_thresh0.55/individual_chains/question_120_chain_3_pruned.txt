Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax, right? So a larger parallax means a closer star.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax (plx). The options are different power laws, like 1/plx^2, 1/plx^3, etc. So I need to find a relationship between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, I think it's about the volume of space that each parallax range corresponds to. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a certain volume depends on the volume. So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Let me think about the formula for distance in terms of parallax. Oh right, the distance d (in parsecs) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, if I consider a thin shell or a spherical shell with radius d and thickness delta_d, the volume of that shell is 4πd² delta_d. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So each plx corresponds to a certain distance, and a change in plx (delta_plx) would correspond to a range in distance.

Since d = 1/plx, then delta_d = derivative of d with respect to plx times delta_plx. Let me compute that. The derivative of d with respect to plx is derivative of (1/plx) = -1/(plx^2). So delta_d ≈ | -1/(plx^2) | * delta_plx = (1/(plx²)) * delta_plx.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + delta_plx. So the corresponding distance goes from d to d + delta_d, where d = 1/plx, and delta_d = (1/(plx²)) * delta_plx. 

But wait, the volume around each star is a
