Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, particularly the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Oh, right, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher energy neutrinos compared to the other branches.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think in the proton-proton chain, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 nucleus, producing a carbon-12 nucleus and emitting a positron and a neutrino. Since the neutrinos are produced in this process, if the pp-III suddenly stops, that would affect the flux of those neutrinos.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux changes in these bands if the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, but waitâ€”what's the main source of neutrinos in the Sun? The dominant process is the pp chain, but the exact branch might affect the neutrino energy. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch is for higher energies.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But what about the other branches? The question says
