Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three separate reactions, each labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine the products of each reaction and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diester with two acetoxy groups. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, it should deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group in the 3-position. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, wait, wait. The position might be different. Let me think: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 if the substituents are on the 3 and 4 positions. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the formula would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, right? So the enolate is at the central carbon. When it attacks, the new bond forms between the alpha carbon (of the enolate) and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate has added to the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C-O-(p-tolyl)? No, wait, the structure is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, the formula given is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, which is the gamma position. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but that can't be because that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C-OOCCH3 but with a p-tolyl on the 3-position? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but that would be an allyl ester. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's say the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the acrylate, which has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Then the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Alternatively,
