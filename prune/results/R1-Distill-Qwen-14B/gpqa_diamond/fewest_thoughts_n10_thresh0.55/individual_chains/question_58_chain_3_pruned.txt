Okay, so I need to figure out which physical theory among the options never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's think about each option one by one.

First, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cut-off' or some other method to make the math finite, and then you remove it later, hopefully getting a finite result. But some theories might not need this because they naturally avoid such divergences, or maybe they're non-perturbative.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which suggests that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings. String theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because strings have length scales, maybe that helps in keeping things finite without needing regularization. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they still use regularization in any part?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like renormalization. But wait, isn't that a form of regularization? Or maybe it's a different process. Oh wait, regularization is a step in renormalization. So QCD does require regularization when you're doing loop calculations because of divergences. But then again, because QCD is asymptotically free, the coupling becomes weak at high energies, so maybe it's more manageable, but I think regularization is still needed.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has dealt with divergences since its early days. For example, the calculation of the electron's self-energy leads to infinities, which are handled by renormalization. So regularization is definitely used here. Techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization are part of the process in QED.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't usually have the same issues as quantum ones. Classical electrodynamics deals with Maxwell's equations and doesn't involve quantum effects like renormalization. So in classical ED, you don't have divergences in the same way because it's a deterministic theory. So there's no need
