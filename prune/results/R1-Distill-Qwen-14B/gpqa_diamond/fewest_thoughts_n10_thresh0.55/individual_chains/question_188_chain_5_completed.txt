Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all their angles equal too. So the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and the angles are the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, rhombohedral can have a=b=c, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no. No, no, for a rhombohedral crystal, it's a special case where a=b=c but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, no, wait, I think in this problem, alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. So that's the setup.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, the interatomic distance—does that refer to the unit cell edge length? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be equal to 'a', the edge length. So maybe here, the edge length a is 10 Angstrom. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, rhombohedral can sometimes be a bit more complex, but maybe in this case, since it's specified that a=b=c and angles are 30 degrees, the interatomic distance is just the edge length a.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(k l cos α) )).

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, right? Because alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So the formula simplifies a bit. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ). Since all the angles are equal, gamma=beta=alpha=30°, so cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1. Plugging into the formula, the denominator becomes sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) + 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) + 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) ) Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Wait, (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) is 1+1+1=3. Then, 2hk cos gamma is 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). Similarly, 2hl cos beta is also sqrt(3), and 2kl cos alpha is sqrt(3). So adding all together, 3 + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator is the square root of (3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that numerically. Let's calculate 3 + 3*sqrt(3). sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. 3 * 1.732 is about 5.196. So 3 plus 5.196 is 8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196). Let me compute sqrt(8.196). Hmm, sqrt(8) is 2.828, sqrt(9) is 3. So 8.196 is a bit more than 8, perhaps around 2.86. Let me calculate 2.86^2: 2.86 * 2.86. Let's see, 2.8^2=7.84, 0.06^2=0.0036, 2*2.8*0.06=0.336. So 7.84 +0.336=8.176, plus 0.0036 gives 8.1796. Wait, but 2.86^2 is 8.1796, which is a bit less than 8.196. So maybe 2.863? Let me compute 2.863^2. 2.863 * 2.863. Let's compute 2.8^2=7.84, 0.063^2≈0.003969, and 2*2.8*0.063=0.3528. So 7.84 + 0.3528 = 8.1928, plus 0.003969 gives about 8.196769. Oh, that's very close to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So denominator is approximately 2.863. Then interplanar distance d= a / 2.863. Since a is 10 Angstrom, d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom. Wait, wait a second, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstrom. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait wait, no. No, wait, I must have miscalculated. Because 10 divided by 2.863 is about 3.49, but the options are about 9, which is way bigger. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, another thought—maybe the interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else. Because in a crystal, the interatomic distance can sometimes refer to, for example, the distance between atoms along a certain direction, not necessarily the unit cell edge length. Hmm, but in a simple cubic structure, a is the edge length and equals the interatomic distance. But maybe in this rhombohedral structure, the a is the edge length but the nearest neighbor distance isn't necessarily a. Wait, but that's not the case. Wait, in a face-centered or body-centered structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be different, but in a simple cubic, it's a. But this is a rhombohedral structure, so perhaps the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which might be along a certain direction. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. So the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system. Let me recall. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

But in this case, since all angles are 30 degrees and a=b=c, so the formula can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(30) + 2hl cos(30) + 2kl cos(30) )

Since h=k=l=1, that becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1)*cos(30)*3 )

Wait, wait, wait. Because 2hk cos γ is 2*1*1*(√3/2), and same for each pair—hk, hl, kl. So there are three terms each adding sqrt(3)/2 * 2, which is sqrt(3). Wait, no. Let me compute each term:

For 2hk cosγ: 2*1*1* (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)
Same for 2hl cosβ: sqrt(3)
Same for 2kl cosα: sqrt(3)
So total is 3 + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3)
Which is the same as before. So denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me 3+3*1.732= 8.196, so sqrt(8.196)=2.863, leading to d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is much larger. So that suggests I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, because in a cubic system, the formula is a√(h²+k²+l²). But in rhombohedral, since all angles are same, the formula might have 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ, where θ is the angle between the axes.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Since for a rhombohedral system, each pair of axes has the same angle, θ = 30°, so cosθ = sqrt(3)/2.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute inside the square root:

3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2 )

Simplify:

3 + 3*sqrt(3)

Which is the same as before. So same result. So my calculation was correct, but the answer of ~3.49 Angstrom doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm. So perhaps I've misunderstood the interatomic distance. Maybe the interatomic distance is not 'a', but another value. Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might be along a different direction. Or perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the edge length 'a' in the unit cell. Hmm, but that's the same as in simple cubic.

Wait, but maybe in this problem, the interatomic distance is not 'a' but the nearest neighbor distance. For a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be found using the formula involving the angles. So perhaps I need to compute 'a' based on the nearest neighbor distance provided.

Wait, let me think. If the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is 10 Angstrom, how is that related to 'a'?

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the cube diagonal or something else. Wait, in a simple cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor is found in the direction of the edges.

Wait, but for a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between nearest neighbors is 'a', because each atom is at the corners of the cube. Wait, but wait, the structure could be different. Oh, wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system when angles are 90, but when they are not, it's a separate system. But the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is 'a', but in a more complex structure, like fcc or bcc, it's different.

But in this case, assuming it's a simple rhombohedral structure, like simple cubic but with 30-degree angles. So the nearest neighbor distance would be 'a', as each atom is at the cube corners. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a=10.

Wait, but in that case, the interplanar distance would be 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't among the options. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is not the edge length, but perhaps the distance between the centers of adjacent unit cells, which would be a different calculation.

Wait, no, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is a. So perhaps a=10 Angstrom. But then d is about 3.49, which doesn't match options. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different. I've looked up before, but perhaps I should recall that in a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that's what I used earlier, leading to same result. So perhaps the issue is that the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is not 'a' but another value.

Hmm, perhaps I should derive the relation between 'a' and the nearest neighbor distance. Let's think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron. The distance between two adjacent atoms is along the edge. So the distance between two corner atoms is 'a', so 'a' is the interatomic distance. Therefore, if interatomic distance is 10, 'a' is 10.

But then the interplanar distance is about 3.49, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and the area of the (111) planes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula for interplanar distance. Let me think again about the general formula.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )) )

But in this case, since α=β=γ=30°, and a=b=c, the formula reduces to:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(30) + 2hl cos(30) + 2kl cos(30) )

Wait, but since h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2(1)(1) cos30 * (3) )

Wait, no, because each term is 2hk cos(theta), but since h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1* cos30, and there are three such terms (hk, hl, kl). So 3*(2*cos30) = 6*cos30.

Wait, wait, let me recheck.

The denominator is sqrt( 3 + 2*cos(30) [hk + hl + kl] )

Wait, because each of the cross terms is 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha. But since all angles are equal, each cos term is cos(30). So:

Denominator = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 cos(30) (hk + hl + kl) )

So for h=k=l=1:

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2 cos30 (3) ) = sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Because 2 * cos30 * (1+1+1) = 6 cos30.

Wait, that's a different way of looking at it. So 6 cos30.

Compute that:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So again, d = a / 2.863 ≈10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all about 9 Angstrom. So this suggests I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the edge length but the nearest neighbor distance. Oh, wait, wait! In a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbor distance could be along a different direction than the edge. So perhaps the edge length 'a' is not the same as the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so 'a' is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor is not along the edge but along a different direction, like a diagonal.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure is along the cube diagonal. So in that case, the nearest neighbor distance isn't 'a' but something else.

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so 'a' = interatomic distance. But in a more complex structure, like fcc, the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal. So in this rhombohedral case, perhaps it's different.

Wait, if the rhombohedral structure is a simple cubic, then 'a' is the interatomic distance. But perhaps in this problem, the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which for rhombohedral might not be 'a'.

Hmm. Let's think about this. The distance between two adjacent atoms in a simple cubic structure (which rhombohedral is, when a=b=c and angles are 90 degrees) is along the edge. So 'a' is the edge length, which is the interatomic distance. But when the angles are not 90, perhaps the edge length is related to the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is given, which is 10 Angstrom. So in that case, 'a' is not 10, but something else.

So how would I calculate 'a' from the nearest neighbor distance?

In a rhombohedral structure, the distance between two adjacent atoms (nearest neighbors) is 'a', because the atoms are at the corners of the unit cell. So 'a' would be the interatomic distance. So if interatomic distance is 10, then a=10. But then the interplanar distance is about 3.49, which is not in the options. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I have mixed up the crystal system. Wait, rhombohedral has a=b=c and angles equal but not 90. If all the angles are 30 degrees, then the structure is very different.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to a face-centered or body-centered arrangement, but the question says rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic system with angles not 90.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look for other references.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should be using the Miller indices (111) and calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, but that's more advanced, and perhaps not necessary.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but that's what I've been using. So perhaps the problem is to compute this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the denominator more accurately. Let's compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3 +5.196152423= 8.196152423.

The square root of 8.196152423 is approximately 2.86357.

So d = 10 / 2.86357 ≈3.490 Angstrom.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but another parameter.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between the (111) planes, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the interplanar distance. Let me think about the general formula again.

Wait, the interplanar distance formula for any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2) ) + ... (terms involving cosines) )

But since in this case, a=b=c= a, and angles are same, the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

a_{ij} = a^2 [ δ_{ij} cosθ + sinθ cosφ_0 δ_{i,j≠k} } ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Another approach: The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ ), where θ is the angle between the axes. So for θ=30°, V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 ).

Let me compute this:

sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So,

1 - 3*(0.75) = 1 - 2.25 = -1.25.

Then,

2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) = 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 ) ) = (6*sqrt(3))/8 = (3*sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (3 *1.732)/4 ≈5.196/4 ≈1.299.

So,

sqrt( -1.25 + 1.299 ) = sqrt(0.049) ≈0.2214.

So V = a^3 * 0.2214.

But I'm not sure how this helps in finding the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the area of the (111) plane and the volume to find the interplanar distance. The area of the (111) plane is (1/d)^2, where d is the interplanar distance. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = 2π (a1)/(a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ... )) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the correct formula, but the answer is not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, let me re-read the problem.

Question: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So 'a' is 10. Angles are 30 each. (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me think about the case when h=k=l=1 in a cubic system. For a cubic system with angles 90, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3). So for a=10, that would be 10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom. So in that case, it's about 5.77. But in the options, the numbers are around 9 Angstrom, which is bigger than 'a', which is 10.

Wait, that's impossible because the interplanar distance is always smaller than the edge length in the same direction. Wait, for example, in fcc, the (111) planes are closer together than the (100) planes, but the distance is less than 'a'.

Wait, but in this case, the interplanar distance is about 3.49, which is less than 'a' of 10. So none of the options are compatible. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but the nearest neighbor distance in a different direction.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the [111] direction, not [100]. So if the nearest neighbor distance is along the [111] direction, then the distance for [111] is given by a * sqrt(3), because in a simple cubic structure, the [111] vector has a magnitude of a*sqrt(3). So if that's 10 Angstrom, then a=10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 Angstrom.

So then, the interplanar distance would be a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, substituting a=5.7735:

Denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d =5.7735 / 2.863 ≈2.016 Angstrom. Which is even smaller. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to compute each term again.

Given that:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

With h=k=l=1 and α=β=γ=30°, cos30=√3/2≈0.8660.

So,

Denominator:

3 + 2*(1*1*0.866) + 2*(1*1*0.866) + 2*(1*1*0.866) 

= 3 + (2*0.866)*3 

= 3 + 5.196 

=8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d= a / 2.863.

If a=10, d≈3.49.

But options are much higher, so perhaps a is different.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along a different direction. Let's think, the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral crystal could be along the direction of the edges or along the face diagonals or the cube diagonals.

Suppose interatomic distance is along the cube diagonal, which is (1,1,1). So the length of the cube diagonal is a√3. So if that's 10, then a=10 /√3 ≈5.7735.

Then,

d = a / 2.863 ≈5.7735 /2.863 ≈2.016 Angstrom. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a face diagonal. The face diagonal would have length a√2. So if a√2=10, a=10/√2≈7.071.

Then,

d =7.071 /2.863 ≈2.467 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length 'a', and our calculation is correct, but the options are incorrect. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, 1/d = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) / a.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by another formula. Let me think about the general case again.

Wait, in a cubic system with angles alpha, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

But for a cubic system, alpha=beta=gamma.

So in this case, perhaps because all angles are 30°, the formula applies as:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos30 )

Which is the same calculation as before.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else, like the distance between two planes. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: perhaps the reciprocal of d is confused with the formula. For example, perhaps I should take 1/d and square it, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Miller indices. (111) plane: the distance between planes is d. Each plane is perpendicular to the vector (1,1,1) scaled by some factor.

Wait, the plane equation is (hkl) · r = d. So the normal vector is (h,k,l), which is (1,1,1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(1+1+1) = sqrt(3). So the unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

The interplanar distance 'd' is the distance between two adjacent planes. So, considering a point on the plane, say (a/2, a/2, a/2), and the next plane, which would be at (a/2 + a, a/2, a/2) because the planes are spaced by 'a' in the direction of the normal vector.

Wait, perhaps this approach won't give me the correct answer, but let me try.

The distance between two adjacent planes is calculated as the projection of 'a' along the direction of the normal vector.

So the distance 'd' is a * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the normal vector and the direction along which the planes are spaced.

Wait, this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance refers to the spacing between (111) planes. But the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the interplanar distance is given by a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula should be d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + ...) )

Wait, no, that would give negative values sometimes, which doesn't make sense. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), where theta is 30°, but perhaps I should use cos(theta) as negative.

Wait, no, because the angle between axes is 30°, and cos(30) is positive.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in my initial approach, but I can't find it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Searching my memory, I recall that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Where theta is the angle between the axes (30°).

So for (111), h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3) )

Which is the same as before.

So I think my calculation is correct, leading to d≈3.49 Angstrom. But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the distance between the (111) planes as the interatomic distance, which would be 10 Angstrom, but that's unlikely because (111) planes are usually closer together than the interatomic distance along the edges.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is being applied incorrectly, and the correct approach is to use the reciprocal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^{-1}.

Which is the same as what I've been using.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3) as 3 (1 + sqrt(3)), which is about 3*(2.732)=8.196.

So, the denominator is sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

So d= a / 2.863.

If a=10, d=3.49.

But options are all around 9, which is about 10 * (9/10) ≈10, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the reciprocal of the denominator? No, that would give a much larger value.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal, but that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should be d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + ... )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is, in fact, about a hexagonal crystal, but the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the spacing between the planes, but that seems contradictory.

Wait, let's think of another approach. Let me compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance.

If the interplanar distance is d, then 1/d is proportional to sqrt(3 + 3√3) when a=10.

So 1/d≈1/3.49≈0.286.

If the options are around 9, then 1/d=0.111, which would correspond to a denominator of ~9.

Wait, so what's the denominator for 1/d=0.111?

d=9 → denominator =10/9≈1.111.

So, 3 + 3√3 = (denominator)^2 = (10/9)^2 ≈1.234.

But 3 +3√3≈8.196, which is way larger than 1.234. So that's not possible.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60°, but the question says 30°. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula is different. Let me think of the (111) planes in a cubic system. The interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3).

In this rhombohedral case, with angles lower than 90°, perhaps the planes are further apart than in the cubic case.

Wait, for a cubic system with a=10, (111) planes are at 5.77 Angstrom. So if the rhombohedral system has a=10 but angles 30°, would the interplanar distance be larger or smaller?

Wait, the formula for d is a / denominator, and denominator is sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈2.863.

In the cubic case, denominator is sqrt(3)≈1.732. So in the cubic case, d=10/1.732≈5.77. But here, denominator is larger, so d is smaller. So in our case, d is 3.49, which is smaller than 5.77, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for the rhombohedral system. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, another way to calculate the interplanar distance is using the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice. But that's perhaps beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should be using is d = a * sqrt( (1 + 1 +1) + 2( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )) )^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but a different value. Let me think, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two (111) planes.

Wait, but that's not possible because the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, not the planes.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between the (111) planes, but that's not standard terminology. So that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not a rhombohedral but a hexagonal close-packed structure, but the question clearly states rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 'd' and see if it matches any of the options. But 1/d=0.286, which is much smaller than the options (which are ~9), so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3) somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 ( hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα ) )

Which for (111) and angles 30°, gives:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(√3/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 3√3)

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more accurately. Let me compute 3 +3√3.

√3≈1.73205080757.

3√3≈5.1961524227.

3 +5.1961524227=8.1961524227.

The square root of 8.1961524227 is approximately 2.863572726.

So d=10/2.863572726≈3.4907 Angstrom.

So the answer seems to be approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the (111) planes, which is d=10 Angstrom. Then, the denominator would be sqrt(3 + 3√3) = sqrt(8.19615) ≈2.86357. So then,

10 = a / 2.86357 → a=10 * 2.86357 ≈28.6357 Angstrom.

But that would make the interplanar distance 10, which is given. But that would only be the case if the interatomic distance is the same as the interplanar distance, which is not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me think of the formula for a simple cubic system. The interplanar spacing is a/sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2). For (111), it's a/sqrt(3). If a=10, then d=5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )^{-1}.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the volume of the unit cell and the area of the (111) plane.

The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2(30) + 2 cos^3(30) ), as I calculated earlier.

But how does that help? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the (111) plane is A = (a^2) * sqrt( ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the area of the plane is A = a^2 / (sqrt(3)) ), and the volume is V = a^3 * sqrt( ... ), and the interplanar distance is V/A.

Let me compute that.

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) )

= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (4 -9)/4 + (3√3)/4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (3√3 -5)/4 )

Compute numerator:

3√3 ≈5.196, so 5.196 -5=0.196.

So sqrt(0.196/4) = sqrt(0.049)≈0.2214.

So V= a^3 * 0.2214.

The area of the (111) plane: for a cubic system, area A = (a^2) / sqrt(3).

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, the area of the (111) plane can be found using the magnitude of the cross product of the basis vectors.

The area is given by the magnitude of the cross product of vectors a × b, scaled by 1/d.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using Bragg's law, but without knowing the wavelength, that's not helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the interatomic distance in a different way. Let me think: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a', but the distance between nearest neighbors along the (111) direction.

So, the distance between two atomic positions along the [111] direction is given by the vector (a, a, a), whose magnitude is a * sqrt(3). So if that's 10 Angstrom, then a=10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735.

Then, the interplanar distance would be a / sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈5.7735 / 2.86357 ≈2.016 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance along [100], which would be 'a' =10.

So, with a=10, the interplanar distance is 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't an option.

Therefore, I think the problem must have a mistake, or perhaps I misunderstood the setup. But since the options don't match, perhaps I should re-examine the formula.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that in rhombohedral systems, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But perhaps the cos(theta) is negative. Because sometimes angles in crystals are measured as internal angles, which for a rhombohedral system could be obtuse.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh! I think I made a mistake here. In crystallography, the angles given are the internal angles between the lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral system, the angles can be either acute or obtuse, depending on the structure. For example, in a rhombohedral system with angles of 60°, that's a different structure than 120°.

Wait, but the problem states that alpha=beta=gamma=30°, which are very acute angles. So the angles in the formula would be 30°, and cos(30) is positive.

But wait, in some conventions, the angles used in the formula for interplanar distance are the supplementary angles (180 - theta), which would be 150°, and cos(150) is -√3/2.

Wait, this could be the mistake. Because in some cases, the angle used in the interplanar distance formula is the angle between the vectors as seen from the origin, which can be the supplementary angle.

So, perhaps I should have used cos(150°) instead of cos(30°).

Let me try that.

So, cos(150°) = -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So, denominator becomes:

sqrt(3 +2*(1 +1 +1) * (-√3/2) )

Wait, no, because each term is 2hk cos(theta), which would now be 2*1*1*(-√3/2) = -√3.

So,

Denominator is sqrt(3 + ( -√3 ) + ( -√3 ) + ( -√3 ) )

= sqrt(3 - 3√3 )

But 3√3≈5.196, so 3 -5.196= -2.196. The square root of a negative number is imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Therefore, that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should use the angle between the vectors as 30°, not 150°. So the initial approach was correct.

Hmm.

I'm running out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )^{-1}.

No, that would give d= a / sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms along the (111) direction, which is a√3 =10, so a=10/√3≈5.7735.

Then, interplanar distance would be a / sqrt(3 + 3√3) ≈5.7735 /2.863≈2.016 Angstrom.

But again, not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (100) planes, which is a=10.

But that doesn't help because our calculation is for (111).

Wait, I think I've exhausted all options. I'll conclude that the correct interplanar distance is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3 +3√3=8.196, and sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

The closest option is not present, but perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute 10/2.863.

10 /2.863 → Let's compute 2.863 *3.49 → 

2.863 *3=8.589

2.863 *0.49= approx 1.403.

Total is 8.589+1.403=9.992, which is close to 10. So 3.49 *2.863=10. So d=3.49 Angstrom.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 3.49, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), we have \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 2(3 \cdot \cos(30^\circ))}}
\]

\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}}
\]

\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}}
\]

The denominator is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}} \approx \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

Thus:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result is significantly smaller than all the provided options, which are around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the interpretation of the interatomic distance or the problem setup. If the interatomic distance refers to a different direction (e.g., along the [111] direction), the edge length \( a \) would need to be recalculated. However, even after exploring alternative interpretations, none of the options align with the calculated value of approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \).

Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the provided options, it is possible that the problem statement or the options contain an error. Based on the calculations, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but this value does not match any of the given choices.
