Okay, so I have this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me see. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth, right? So, if the pp-III branch stopped, that means the neutrinos emitted from that process wouldn't reach us anymore. But how does that affect the flux we observe here on Earth?

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands and what the ratio would be without it.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that in the proton-proton chain, there are different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form carbon-12, which then goes through the triple-alpha process. But I'm not too clear on the details. 

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch, if I'm not wrong, produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe around 700-800 keV or higher. Oh wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are
