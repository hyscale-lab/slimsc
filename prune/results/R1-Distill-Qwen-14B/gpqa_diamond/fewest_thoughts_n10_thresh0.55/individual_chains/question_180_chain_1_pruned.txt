Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says we've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that; it's all about potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, so I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law, which is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But wait, when calculating the potential energy of a system of multiple charges, I have to consider all the pairs and sum their potential energies. Oh right, because each charge contributes to the potential of the others.

Wait, but in this setup, there are 13 charges. 12 are at 2 meters from P, and one is fixed at P. So let me think: The charge at P is interacting with each of the 12 charges at 2 meters. Also, the 12 charges at 2 meters are all at the same distance from each other. Because they're each at 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Oh, wait, if all 12 charges are at the same distance from P, are they arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P? So each of the 12 is on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. But if they're identical and all the same distance from P, their mutual distances would vary. Hmm, but wait, the problem says the 12 are "constrained to stay" at 2 m from P. I think that for the purpose of calculating potential energy, the mutual distances between the 12 charges would be such that each pair contributes to the potential energy. But wait, that might complicate things a lot because I'd have to calculate all the pairwise interactions among the 12.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think: The system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So for all the charges, each pair contributes. So I need to calculate all possible pairs.

Alternatively, maybe the charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies are accounted for, but perhaps in this problem, the 12 charges are all at the same point or something? No, that can't be right because they're at 2 meters from P, but not necessarily at the same point. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So maybe they are all at the same distance from P but spread out in space, perhaps on a sphere. But for potential energy, each pair contributes whether they're close or far apart. That would make the problem complicated because the mutual distances between the 12 charges vary. But perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 are at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are considered in some way. Oh wait, maybe the 12 are all at the same point? No, that wouldn't make sense because then they'd be on top of each other, but the problem states they are kept at 2 meters, so maybe they're equally spaced on a sphere? But that's a lot of charges, and it's complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs (i < j) of U_ij.

In this case, there are two types of pairs:

1. The charge at P (charge Q) with each of the 12 charges at 2 m away.
2. The pairs among the 12 charges themselves, each at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are r_ij, which I don't know. But perhaps the problem is arranged in such
