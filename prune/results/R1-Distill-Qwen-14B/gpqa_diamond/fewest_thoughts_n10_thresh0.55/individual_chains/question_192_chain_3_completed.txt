Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is smaller with radius r, and the center of the cavity is shifted by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh right, and there's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere inside that cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Oh, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so I need to find the magnitude of the electric field at point P. I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges redistribute themselves in certain ways. But wait, the conductor is uncharged initially, right? Because it's uncharged and the cavity has a charge, I think the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge.

Wait, here's what I recall: when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. But wait, wait, the conductor itself was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, to cancel the charge inside the cavity. And then the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the conductor overall is neutral, so the inner is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. The conductor's inner surface induced a charge of -q, so that the electric field inside the conductor material (the part between inner and outer surfaces) would be zero. So then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, since the total charge on the conductor is zero (because it was uncharged). Oh wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged, the total charge inside it must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q, so the conductor's net charge is zero.

But wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge is zero. The charge in the cavity is +q, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so that the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, that doesn't add up, because (-q) + (+q) would make the conductor's net charge zero. So yes, that makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field at a point outside a conductor, I should think about the charges on the outer surface.

Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere with charge +q. So the electric field outside a spherical shell (conductor) is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², since L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

But wait, does the position of the cavity's center affect this? Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. Hmm, but for the conductor, the induced charges on the inner surface are such that they shield the interior of the conductor. So from the outside, the conductor's outer surface behaves as if all the charge is at the center, regardless of where the inner charge was placed.

Wait, but let me think again. The conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell, so when you have a charge outside, the field is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So in this case, the charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be option B.

But wait, wait a second. What about the configuration of the cavity? Because the cavity is off-center. So the inner induced charge (-q) isn't symmetric. Does that affect the outer charge distribution?

In a spherical conductor, the outer surface will adjust such that the charges distribute uniformly regardless of the inner configuration. Because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely, so any internal arrangement would cause the outer surface to still be spherically symmetric. Because the conductor shields the exterior from the internal arrangement. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed. So when you're outside, the field is as if the charge were at the center.

So the answer should be B. But let me look at the options again.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Yes, that's what I thought.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged conductor, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor then induces a charge of $+q$ to ensure the conductor remains neutral overall. The electric field outside a spherical conductor is determined by the total charge on its outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The field is given by the formula:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The position of the cavity or the offset $s$ does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the conductor shields the exterior from the internal charge distribution. The outer surface charge behaves as if it were uniformly distributed, and the field at $P$ is as if the charge $+q$ were located at the center of the conductor.

Among the given options, the correct expression for the electric field at $P$ is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
