Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given info is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I think mass plays a role in a star's luminosity, especially in main-sequence stars where more massive stars are more luminous. But I'm not entirely sure how to connect the mass here since the question also mentions black body radiation.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because T would be b / λ_max, so if λ_max is equal for both, T is the same.

So both stars have the same temperature. That should help in calculating their luminosities. The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since they have the same T, the luminosity depends on the radius squared.

Wait, but wait a minute. The given data says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 should be (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴/T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, T factors are 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest the factor is about 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... So why are the answer options not just 2.25? Because option D is 2.23, which is close to 2.25, but wait, maybe I
