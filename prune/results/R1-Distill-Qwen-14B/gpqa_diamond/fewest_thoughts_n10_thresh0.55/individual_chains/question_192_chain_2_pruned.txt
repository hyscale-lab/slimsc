Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The setup is a bit complex, but I'll try to visualize it. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor isn't a solid sphere; it's like a shell with a dent in it, but the dent is a spherical cavity. 

Now, some positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, it shouldn't have any net charge, but when a charge is placed inside the cavity, things change. 

Wait, I think when you have a conductor with a cavity and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge. But wait, since the conductor was initially uncharged, the total charge on it would be zero. So the inner surface would have a charge equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. Oh right, the inner surface would have -q, and then the outer surface would have +q because the overall conductor must remain neutral. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Oh wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has induced -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Because the inner surface's -q plus the outer surface's +q gives zero, the total charge. Right.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface is at a higher potential because it's farther from the enclosed charge. But how does that affect the electric field outside the conductor?

So, the
