Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My job is to figure out the chemical formula from the options given.

Alright, let's start with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but I remember that carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is broad, but maybe less so. But here, it's a very broad peak, so maybe a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an -OH group in something else.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1650 peak is a bit lower. Oh wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups, like maybe an aromatic ester or a conjugated ketone. Or maybe it's a C=C stretch. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, 1650 is in the range for conjugated carbonyls, like maybe an alpha, beta-
