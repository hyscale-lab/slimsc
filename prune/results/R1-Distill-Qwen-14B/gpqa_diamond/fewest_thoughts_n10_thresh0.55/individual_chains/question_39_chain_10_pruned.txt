Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, so the setup is that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, we need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the integral of |ψ|^2 over all space should equal 1 because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%. Oh, right! The normalization condition.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, wait a second. Usually, the wave function is a complex function, but I need to check if the imaginary part affects the normalization. Oh, right, because the square modulus is ψ*ψ, so the imaginary parts will contribute terms. But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as real plus imaginary. Let me think. 

Wait, no, the wave function ψ is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. So the conjugate of ψ would be [a/(
