Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relation of parallax. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's a bit unusual. Normally, I remember that the number of stars is related to the volume, which involves distance cubed. But let's think more carefully.

Parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula I remember is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So if plx increases, the distance is smaller, and vice versa.

The number of stars (N) as a function of parallax is given by N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. But I need to express N in terms of distance to see how it changes with r (distance).

Since d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. Let me substitute that into the equation for N. So N = k / ( (1/d) )^5. Simplify that: (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area times the thickness. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Oh wait no, when you're considering a volume, the number of stars in a small volume would be proportional to the volume. But this seems different because the relation given is based on parallax, not directly on volume.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many stars are within a certain distance. Or perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "number of stars in that region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So for each direction in the sky (each line of sight), the number along that line is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Oh wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So N is proportional to d^5.

So if I have a small change in distance dr, how does the
