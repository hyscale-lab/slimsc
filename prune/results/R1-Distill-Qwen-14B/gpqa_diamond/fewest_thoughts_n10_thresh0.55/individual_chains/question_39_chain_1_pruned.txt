Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are located between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

Hmm, wait. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex number, which is fine because it has an 'i' term. But for the probability density, which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, the imaginary part affects that.

Wait, wait. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a function of x. To find the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3, we need to integrate the square of the absolute value of ψ(x) over that interval.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the probability of finding the particle in x <1 or x>3 is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval, right?

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If I square the absolute value, that's ψ*ψ^*, right? Let me compute that.

ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
ψ* = a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i

Multiplying them together: 
ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(-0.5i) + (0.5i)(-0.5i)
Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real? Because 'a' is a constant, and x is real. So a/(sqrt(1+x)) is a real number. So ψ is a real term plus an imaginary term.

So, ψ = Re + Im, where Re = a/(sqrt(1+x)) and Im = -0.5i.

So when I compute |ψ|^2, it's (Re)^2 + (Im)^2.

Because (Re + i Im)(Re - i Im) = Re² + Im².

Wait, but Im here is -0.5i, so Im² is (-0.5i)^2 = (-0.5)^2 * i^2 = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

Wait, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value, which is always real and positive. So, if ψ is a complex function, the probability density
