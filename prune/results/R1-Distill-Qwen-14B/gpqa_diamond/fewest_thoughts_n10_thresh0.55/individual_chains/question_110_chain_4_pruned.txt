Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But their brightness limits are different. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So, the star must be brighter than 17 mag in V to be seen by ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V < 17 can be observed. And for HIRES, stars with V <16 can be observed. So, a star must have V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO, but also less than 16 for HIRES. So the star must be brighter than 16.5? Because, wait, if a star is brighter than 16, it's definitely brighter than 17. So the limiting factor is the HIRES brightness limit of 16 mag.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So, only stars that are bright enough (apparent V magnitude <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO). Wait, no, because the brightness is the apparent magnitude. So if a star's apparent V is brighter than 16, then it can be seen by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, which is brighter than 16.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. Lower (or more negative) magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 15 is brighter than 16, which is brighter than 17.

The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, stars with V < 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So, the star must have V <16 to be observed by both, because if it's V=16.5, it
