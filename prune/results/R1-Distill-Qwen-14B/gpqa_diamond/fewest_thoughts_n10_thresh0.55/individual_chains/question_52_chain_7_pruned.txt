Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to think through it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it changes their overall temperature. But wait, how does that affect the ionization and excitation of atoms in the photosphere?

So, the star's parameters are given: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, okay, so the spots make the star cooler overall.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, when no spots, ratio is higher, and when spots, it's lower. So we're looking for (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots) = factor.

Under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the star, when spots are present, the overall effective temperature is lower. So the photosphere's temperature is lower when there are spots. How does that affect the ratio?

Let me think. Let's denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2. The problem says that R1 is higher than R2, so when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases.

So R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Wait, ΔE is E2 - E1. If E2 > E1, then ΔE is positive. So when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, because the denominator is smaller, making the exponent more negative
