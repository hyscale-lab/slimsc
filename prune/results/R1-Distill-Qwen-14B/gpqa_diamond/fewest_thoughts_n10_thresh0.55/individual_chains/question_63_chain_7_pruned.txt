Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They’re modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, wait—the rigid rotor is the model where the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching. Oh right, because in reality, molecules can vibrate, so the bond length changes a bit.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a particular mode. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, there are vibrational and rotational energy levels. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1? Wait, no, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational quantum number J starts at 0, but maybe the ground state is J=0 and v=0.)

The question asks what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. Oh, so the molecule is absorbing a photon. That photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the current state, and the photon causes a transition to the next state. But what's the next state? It could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher
