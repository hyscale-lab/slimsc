Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go through it step by step.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, but probabilities require normalization.

Wait, right, the state is given as proportional, so I should find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1.

Let me write down |alpha> as a vector. Since |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis, the coefficients will be the components. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me denote the coefficients as a = 1+i and b = 2 - i.

The inner product is a* a + b* b. So I'll compute |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: a is (1+i), so a* is (1-i). Multiplying them gives (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 -i +i +1. Wait, that's 1 +1 = 2? Because the i terms cancel. So |a|^2 is 2.

Similarly, |b|^2: b is (2 -i), so b* is (2 +i). Multiply them: (2)(2) + (2)(i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(i) = 4 +2i -2i -i². The i terms cancel, and -i² is +1. So 4 +1 =5. So |b|^2 is 5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the problem asks to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i !=j, and 0 otherwise. So A is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait
