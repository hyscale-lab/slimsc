Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about some reactions leading to product 3, and then we need to determine the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen. 

Alright, starting from the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. I remember that adamantane derivatives reacting with strong bases can undergo elimination or substitution. Since it's KOH and heating, probably an E2 elimination. So the dibromo compound would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two bromides from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of an alkene. Wait, no, waitâ€”adamantane has four equivalent bridgehead positions. Wait, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. But wait, bridgehead double bonds aren't common because of Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead alkenes are not stable for certain structures. Oh, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so maybe in this case, elimination forms a diene or some kind of strained ring? Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide or something else. Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Oh! So maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because when you have two bromides on adjacent carbons and you treat with a base, maybe it's an elimination forming an epoxide. Wait, how does that happen? Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of an oxide. Because when two adjacent bromides are present, especially in a rigid structure, elimination could form an epoxide. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantylene oxide? Or another epoxide derivative.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) probably the epoxide protons. Epoxide protons usually appear around 4-5 ppm as a multiplet, but in this case, it's a singlet? Wait, no. Wait, in the NMR, 4.79
