Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The solution has a total cobalt concentration of 1e-2 M and 0.1 M SCN-. The stability constants (β) are given for different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant (β) tells us about the tendency of a complex to form. Higher β means more stable complex. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n varies from 0 to 4.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, which would correspond to β2=40? Or wait, wait—β values are for each step. Oh right, β1 is for the first SCN- addition, β2 for the second, etc.

So, the formation of complexes occurs stepwise. For each step, the stability constant is multiplied.

The general approach for this kind of problem is to calculate the concentration of each possible complex, then sum them up along with the free Co²+ ions, and find the ratio of the desired complex to the total.

But wait, how do the βs relate to the formation of each complex? Let me think. The overall β for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise βs. Like, β_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. The stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^k+ is the product of each β from 1 to n. So for n=1, β1=9. For n=2, β2=β1*β2=9*40=360? Or am I mixing up stepwise and overall constants?

Wait, no, the way I remember it, if β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the formation from [CoSCN]^+ plus another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)_2]^{2
