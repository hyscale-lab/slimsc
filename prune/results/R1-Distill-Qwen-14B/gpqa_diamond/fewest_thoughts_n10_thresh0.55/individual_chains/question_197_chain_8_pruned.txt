Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can then think about the reaction conditions to determine the product.

Looking at the IR data: peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1 suggest the presence of an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine. But more likely, an alcohol because 3400 is more typical for O-H. Wait, but there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with carbonyl groups.

Looking at the NMR data:

The peaks are as follows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet at ~10.5 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which would be typical for a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500, which is a broad region. That could include O-H, maybe from an alcohol or phenol, but also possibly an aldehyde (but aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2800-2700 for the C-H stretch, which is missing here). Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, the peak at 10.5 could be an aldehyde proton. But then, where's the C=O stretch? The IR has 1720 cm-1, which aligns with an ester or ketone
