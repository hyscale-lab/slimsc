Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, but the question gives me some specific data. Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period (three times shorter than Planet_2). That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star because orbital period is related to the distance from the star. Kepler's third law says P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass and M is much larger, M+m ≈ M. So for a given star, the period squared is proportional to a cubed.

Wait, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's law: (P1²)/(P2²) = (a1³/a2³) * (M2/M1) because the star's mass is different. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Each planet's system has its own star. So for Planet_1, M1 is the mass of its star, and for Planet_2, M2 is the mass of its star. The formula for each is P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M)). So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³ / M.

So for Planet_1: P1² = (4π² a1³)/(G M1)
For Planet_2: P2² = (4π² a2³)/(G M2)

Taking the ratio of the two, P1² / P2² = (a1³ / a2³) * (M2 / M1)

Given that P1 = P2 /3, then P1² = P2² /9.

So (1/9) = (a1³/a2³) * (M2/M1)

But M1 is twice M2. So M2/M1 = 1/2.

So 1/9 = (a1³/a2³) * (1/2)

Multiply both sides by 9: 1 = (a1³/a2³) * (1/2) * 9

Wait, I think I messed that up. Let me compute step by step.

So 1/9 = (a1³/a2³) * (M2/M1)
But M1 is twice M2. So M2/M1 = (M2)/(2 M2) )= 1/2.

So 1/9 = (a1³/a2³) * (1/2)

Multiply both sides by 2: 2/9 = a1³/a2³.

Take cube roots: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Hmm, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of that is around 0.6. Because (0.6)^3 is about 0.216, which is close
