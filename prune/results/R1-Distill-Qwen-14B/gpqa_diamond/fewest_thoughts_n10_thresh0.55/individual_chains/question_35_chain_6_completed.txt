Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given by A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators like this are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the S matrix here looks familiar. Let me think, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Wait, the given S matrix is actually the form of σ_y multiplied by i, because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] right? Wait, no, wait. The standard Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So actually, S is σ_y. Because S is exactly that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the standard representation of σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S. So S is the Pauli matrix σ_y.

So A_y is c times σ_y. And since c is h/(4π), that's h/(4π) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So, the eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write down A_y first. A_y = c * σ_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, but wait, matrices are easier to handle if I factor out the constant. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i, right? Because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but multiplied by i in some cases. Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each have eigenvalues ±1. So σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by a constant, the eigenvalues scale by that constant.

Wait, but wait: no, because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of c·σ_y would be c*1 and c*(-1), so c and -c.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrix σ_y, when multiplied by i, gives a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me step back.

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. σ_y is Hermitian because it equals its conjugate transpose. So the eigenvalues of σ_y must be real. Let me calculate the eigenvalues of σ_y.

The characteristic equation for σ_y is det(σ_y - a I) = 0. So:

| -a    -i    |
| i     -a    | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i)(i) = a² - (i*(-i)) → Wait, wait, the product is (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - 1 = 0 → a²=1 → a=1 or a=-1.

So the eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y = c σ_y are c*1 and c*(-1), so c and -c.

Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). That's the real parts, because the eigenvalues are real (since σ_y is Hermitian, and c is a real scalar, so A_y is Hermitian as well).

Wait, wait, but what's the problem statement again? The options mention imaginary parts. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, and real part is ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts should be zero. So perhaps options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, A_y is c·σ_y, which is Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be real. So all options that have non-zero imaginary parts can be eliminated.

Looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That's impossible, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, in our calculation, the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), but h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So I think h/(4π) is about 5.29e-35 J·s, which is a very small number. So the eigenvalues would be real and about ±5e-35, which are real. So options B is talking about eigenvalues of ±1 and ±1/2, which doesn't match.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, because A is the angular momentum, A² would be the square of the angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, for a given eigenstate of a component (like A_y), it is also an eigenstate of A². Because the angular momentum components are compatible observables with A². So the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is incorrect because the eigenfunctions would be eigenfunctions of A² as well as A² commutes with all components. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. Basis functions are typically the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So yes, the eigenvectors would form a basis for the space, which is 2D here. So D might be correct, but wait, the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form a basis for the space. So D is a correct statement. But I'm not sure if that's the correct consideration here.

Wait, but let's get back. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So, perhaps the correct answer relates to the eigenvalues being real and ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of the options A or B match that.

Wait, looking back: the problem says the operator is A_y = c·S, where S is the matrix given. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed the Pauli σ_y matrix. So, A_y has eigenvalues ±c, which are real. So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary part.

Looking at the options again, option A suggests the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts, which can't be correct. Option B's eigenvalues are ±1 and ±1/2, which don't match c = h/(4π), which is a real positive number.

So perhaps the correct option is option D, which says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me think about that. The eigenfunctions of A_y (eigenstates of A_y) are also eigenfunctions of A^2. Because for angular momentum, the square of the angular momentum (A^2) commutes with each component, so they share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A^2, but not necessarily of Az, because A_y and Az don't commute (they are different components, so they don't share eigenfunctions). So option C says "the eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." That's correct.

Wait, but wait, the statement in option C says "can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." So that would be correct because the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are eigenfunctions of A² but not of another component like Az.

So the correct answer would be option C.

So let me make sure. The eigenvalues of Ay are real, ±h/(4π), so no option A or B is correct. So the correct statements would be either C or D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is 2D. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So, in the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct, since A² commutes with Ay, but Az doesn't.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Also correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So are both C and D correct? But let's look at the options.

The options are four, and only one is correct.

Wait, the question says which statement below will you consider to be correct. So perhaps more than one could be right, but I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of Ay. During this calculation, which statement is correct.

So, in the process, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So when you find the eigenvectors, they form a basis for the space. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, option C says eigenfunctions also are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct as well.

So now, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the problem, the options are presented as exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me re-calculate. Let me compute the eigenvalues of A_y.

A_y = c * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write A_y as (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So the matrix is:

[ -a      (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i          -a ]

The determinant is ( -a )^2 - [ (h/(4π))^2 * (-i)(i) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is a^2 - (h/(4π))^2 * 1 = 0.

So a^2 = (h/(4π))^2 → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, and their real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero.

So looking at the options, none of the options A or B are correct because they have non-zero imaginary parts.

So the correct statements are C and D, but the question is which option is correct.

So the options are:

A) Im parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/4π → wrong.

B) Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1 → wrong.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az → correct.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay → correct.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice where only one option is correct.

Hmm. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with each of the components. So for a given eigenstate of Ay, it should also be an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the problem statement asks about which statement considers correct during the calculation.

Hmm. Perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the statement D is correct because the matrix's eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct. Because the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix operator form a basis for the space if they are distinct, which they are here since eigenvalues are distinct.

So both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, the possible answers are A, B, C, D.

Ah, but wait, the problem is about the calculation during which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay) but not of Az, which doesn't commute.

So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions of A_y would also be eigenfunctions of A^2 because A^2 and A_y commute. For angular momentum, [A^2, A_y] = 0. So any eigenfunction of A_y is also an eigenfunction of A^2.

But do they share eigenfunctions with Az? No, because [A_y, A_z] is not zero. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z.

So statement C is correct.

As for option D, it's correct that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix operator, but the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So perhaps this is correct as well.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So in the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So, during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct), and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct). So which one is among the options?

Looking at the options, both C and D are correct in the statements, but the options are presented as separate choices. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvalues are real, and options don't mention that. Wait, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the construction of the matrix Ay and its properties.

Wait, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli σ_y matrix. So A_y is proportional to σ_y, which is Hermitian. So A_y is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real, as we found.

So, the eigenvalues are real, which means the imaginary parts are zero. So any option stating otherwise is incorrect.

So, going back to the options, only options C and D are left as possible correct statements.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Meaning, the eigenvectors form a basis. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two, they form a basis. So D is correct.

So, which option is correct: C or D?

The question is about what you will consider correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you'd find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct).

But the options include either C or D as possible answers. The problem says 'which statement below will you consider to be correct'.

Looking at the options, the correct statements are C and D.

But the options are given as separate choices. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, but the answer options are A, B, C, D. So I must choose between them.

Another approach: perhaps to compute the eigenvectors. Let's see.

For A_y, the eigenvalues are ±c, where c = h/(4π).

So for a = c:

(Ay - c I) φ = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -c      (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i          -c ]

Which is:

[ -c            (-i c) ]
[ (i c)          -c ]

Wait, because h/(4π) is c, so h/(4π)*-i is -i c.

So the equations are:

- c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

The eigenvector can be written as [ φ1; φ2 ] = [ -i φ2; φ2 ] = φ2 [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i; 1 ].

Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvector is [ i; 1 ].

So the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are [ -i, 1 ]^T and [ i, 1 ]^T, up to a scalar multiple.

These are the basis functions for the operator, which is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis.

So option D is correct.

So, in the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you'd see that they form a basis. So D is correct.

Now, about option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Because for spin-1/2 particles, A² has eigenvalues (ħ^2 s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have the same eigenvalue for all states.

Wait, let me think again. A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so A² has eigenvalues ( (ħ/2)( (ħ/2) +1 ) ) * something. Wait, but perhaps in this case, since A_y is proportional to σ_y, which is a Pauli matrix, A² would be (c σ_y)^2 = c² σ_y². But σ_y² is the identity matrix, because all Pauli matrices squared are identity.

So σ_y squared is [[1 0],[0 1]]. So A² = c² I.

So, for any vector, when you apply A², you get c² times the vector. So any eigenvector of A_y is also an eigenvector of A², because A² is just a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A².

So, option C is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But wait, the options are presented as four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But in the options, both C and D could be correct. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider correct during the calculation.

So, the first thing you'd do is find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So when you find the eigenvectors, you realize that they form a basis (so D is correct). Also, during the calculation, knowing that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² (because A² is proportional to the identity matrix, which commutes with everything) is another correct statement (so C is correct).

But since the options are presented as four, and I have to choose one, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct option is C.

Because in the process of calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (so D is correct), but you'd also know that they are eigenfunctions of A². So perhaps option C's statement is correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to process each option again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: same issue with imaginary parts.

Option C: correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: correct because eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements. Hmm.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, any eigenstate of a component (like Ay) is an eigenstate of A² but not of another component (like Az). So option C is correct.

So, the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S = \sigma_y \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), as it is a Pauli matrix. Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues:**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

3. **Eigenvectors and Basis Functions:**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space. This makes **Option D** correct.

4. **Eigenfunctions and Commutators:**
   - The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct statements. However, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. Since \( A_y \) being an eigenoperator of \( A^2 \) is a key property in quantum mechanics and directly relevant to the calculation, **Option C** is the most appropriate answer.

### Conclusion:
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This aligns with the commutator properties of angular momentum operators.

**Answer: C**
