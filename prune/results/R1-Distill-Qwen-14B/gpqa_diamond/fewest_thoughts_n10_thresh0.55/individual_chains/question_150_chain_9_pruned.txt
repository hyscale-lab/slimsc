Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in proton NMR, certain regions indicate specific functional groups. The peak around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up high, around 9-10 ppm. The fact that it's a triplet (t) suggests maybe it's coupled with two protons? Or perhaps it's an aromatic aldehyde in a conjugated system.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating for 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a d, which often corresponds to a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each proton has only one neighboring proton, so each would be a doublet. Similarly, 6.51 is another doublet, maybe another para-substituted ring but with a different substituent.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be some sort of aromatic protons as well, but the broad singlet makes me think maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like an enol. Alternatively, it could be a di-substituted ring where the protons are equivalent and not split much, but the broadness might suggest some hydrogen exchange or being part of a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a downfield shift. A doublet with two protonsâ€”maybe an -OCH2- group. Because oxygen usually deshields nearby protons, and a CH2 next to O would show up around 3.5-4 ppm. So maybe it's an ether or an ester group, but considering the molecular formula, which has an N, perhaps it's part of a more complex structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no. Wait the formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. X is zero here. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let's compute: 18-9=9, +1=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That's 5 rings or double bonds. Let's think: benzene rings contribute 3 each (since benzene is 3 double bonds). So if there's a benzene ring, that's 3 DoU. Then, if there's another double bond, that's 4 DoU. Then, maybe an aldehyde (which is a double bond to O, but that's considered a double bond for DoU). Wait, each double bond or ring counts as one. So an aldehyde is a double bond, that's another. So benzene (3) + aldehyde (1) + maybe another double bond (like an enal) would make 5. Alternatively, benzene (3) + a ketone (1, but if we have an aldehyde, maybe that's
