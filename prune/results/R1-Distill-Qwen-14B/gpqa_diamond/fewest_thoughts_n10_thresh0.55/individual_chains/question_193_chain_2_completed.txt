Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, or N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. They're asking per unit range of distance, r. Hmm, maybe they're talking about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, so like a differential number.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is distance. Let me express N in terms of d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but wait, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. That seems like a lot.

But wait, parallax is in parsecs, so if I have a region of the sky, the number of stars in that region as a function of distance. Wait, maybe it's about the number density. Let me think about the volume.

The number of stars should be proportional to the volume, but volume depends on radius. Wait, the volume element in spherical shells is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would depend on the density, which in this case is N(r) dr = (something) * r² dr.

Wait, but the question states that N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that would make N ∝ (d)^5. So N = k * d^5 for some constant k.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the volume. Because for each shell, the number of stars should be the surface area times thickness times density. So if N is proportional to d^5, then that's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But wait, that doesn't make sense in terms of the distribution of stars. Because as you go further away, the number of stars you can see in a given volume should decrease because they're more spread out. Unless the star density increases, but in reality, the density of stars in the galaxy decreases with distance from the galactic plane, but assuming this is a general question without those specifics, perhaps it's a different scenario.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe they're considering the differential number, like the number in a thin shell. So if N is proportional to d^5, then when you go to a larger d, the number of stars per shell would increase. But that seems counterintuitive because if you look at a larger distance, the same solid angle would encompass fewer stars, unless the density is increasing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the number per unit volume and the number in a shell. Let me clarify.

If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So for a given region (same solid angle), as you go further away, the number of stars increases as d^5. But that doesn't make sense because at larger distances, each star would be farther away, and you can only see a few in that region.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux. The number of stars depends on how bright they are and how far they are. The flux received from a star is proportional to L/(4πd²), but that's about brightness, not the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars within a certain distance range. Let's say we have a volume between d and d+dr. The volume is 4/3 π (d+dr)^3 - 4/3 π d^3 ≈ 4π d² dr for small dr. So the number of stars in this volume would be proportional to volume times density.

But in this question, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So perhaps the density (number per unit volume) is proportional to d^5. So the number in a shell at distance d would be density * volume element. Volume element is 4π d² dr. So the number dN would be (density) * 4π d² dr. If density is proportional to d^5, then dN ∝ d^5 * d² * dr = d^7 dr. But that seems way too high. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number in a thin shell, which is proportional to d^5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is: How does the number of stars in that region change with distance per unit range of distance, r? So perhaps it's the number per unit distance. Let me think.

If N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars increases with distance. So for each unit increase in distance (r), the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to r^5. So the change in number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5k r^4, where k is the constant. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. But the question is about how the number changes, so maybe the number itself is proportional to r^5, so the answer would be option B, r^5.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So for a given region (same solid angle), the number of stars increases as d^5. So if you double the distance, the number of stars in that region would go up by a factor of 32 (2^5), which seems odd. But perhaps in this scenario, the star density increases with distance (which is not typical, but maybe in the problem's context).

Alternatively, perhaps the region is expanding, so the same solid angle now encompasses more volume as it's looking further away, hence more stars. So the number depends on d^5, leading to option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible answers are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So if N ∝ d^5, then the number increases with distance as r^5. So the correct answer would be B.

But wait, another approach: The number of stars as a function of distance. Let’s model it. Suppose N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So for each distance d, the number of stars in that region is proportional to d^5. So the number increases as d^5. Therefore, the number of stars in a region at distance r is proportional to r^5, so the answer is B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the relationship, \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars in the region increases as the distance increases, specifically proportional to \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, \( r \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the number of stars in the region grows with distance according to this power-law relationship. Therefore, the correct answer is that the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \).

Answer: B
