Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, that's C8H9NO. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5 degrees. So that's like five rings or double bonds or triple bonds. Since O is 1, maybe a carbonyl group?

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons maybe.

Then 6.98 ppm is a doublet with 2H, 6.51 is another doublet with 2H. Those look like two sets of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Because the doublets could be two protons each, in a para arrangement. Like two benzene rings each with two protons in a doublet.

Next, 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad singlet might be an acidic proton, like an -OH group. Or maybe an enol? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe some kind of conjugated system.

3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That seems like a CH2 group next to something else. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 between two carbonyls or something else.

Wait, putting it all together. The aldehyde (9.72 ppm) suggests a carbonyl group. The two aromatic protons each as doublets could mean two benzene rings substituted in such a way that each has two protons as doublets. So maybe each ring is para-substituted with another group. Like two benzene rings attached to a chain.

Looking at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde is probably part of a longer chain with substituents. Maybe the compound is something like a diaryl aldehyde.

Wait, the NMR shows 6.27 as a broad singlet, 2H. Maybe those are two -OH groups? Or perhaps it's a dienol system? Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene, but the broadness suggests something else. Like an enol form. Or maybe it's an -OCH2- group. The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H: OCH2 would fit, since OCH2 protons are typically around 3.5-4 ppm.

Wait, so maybe the structure is something like this: a central chain with an aldehyde group, an OCH2 group, and two benzene rings attached. So like R-O-CH2-CR2-CHO or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula: C8
