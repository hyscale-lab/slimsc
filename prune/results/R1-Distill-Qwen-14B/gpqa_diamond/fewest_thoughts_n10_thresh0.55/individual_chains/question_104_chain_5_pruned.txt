Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we observe this as a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main thing here is the Doppler shift they cause.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. So Planet #2 is causing a larger shift, which means the star is moving faster. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

I recall that the RV method formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. Oh right, but the actual velocity depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, the formula for K is more precise, perhaps involving the mass ratio and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (1/( (4π²) * P² )^(1/3) )) * sin i ) 

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. And the problem states that the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun. So M_planet << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Moreover, the orbits are circular, so e=0, which simplifies the equation further because (1 - e²) becomes 1.

So the simplified formula is K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (4 π² P²)^(1/3) )) * sin i

Wait, but since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, sin i is probably similar as well (assuming same inclination, but the problem doesn't specify, but since it's comparing the two, maybe the inclination angles are the same or similar, but perhaps it's a given that sin i is the same for both. Or maybe it's not given, so perhaps we can assume it's the same for both, as the problem doesn't state otherwise. Alternatively, it's possible that the actual velocity depends on sin i, but since both planets cause a shift, perhaps in this problem, the sin i is the same, so it cancels out when taking the ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for the same star mass and same planet mass, the velocity amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, let me think about the formula again.
