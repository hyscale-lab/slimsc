Okay, so I have this question about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The plane in question is the (111) plane. I need to find the interplanar distance for that.

Wait, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)( (1 - cosα)/( (cosα)^2 + (cosβ)^2 + (cosγ)^2 - 2 cosα cosβ cosγ )) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind when the lattice is not cubic. For a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by d_{hkl} = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a rhombohedral system can be simplified if all angles are equal, which they are here (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees). So let's see.

In a cubic
