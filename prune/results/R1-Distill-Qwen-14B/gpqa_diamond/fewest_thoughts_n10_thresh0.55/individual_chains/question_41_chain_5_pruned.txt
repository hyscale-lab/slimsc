Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Oh wait, and it's moving toward the observer in the lab. So the light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving towards us. Interesting.

The question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are given. Let's see, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but wait, that's in the medium's rest frame, right? Because in a medium like glass, light slows down. But here, the glass is moving. So does the velocity of the glass affect the observed speed of light in it?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think this is a case of relative motion between the medium and the observer. Oh right, when the medium is moving, does it affect the speed of light as observed? Or does the speed just depend on the medium's properties regardless of motion?

Wait, from what I remember, the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. Now, if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us at speed v.

Wait, but according to relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly when
