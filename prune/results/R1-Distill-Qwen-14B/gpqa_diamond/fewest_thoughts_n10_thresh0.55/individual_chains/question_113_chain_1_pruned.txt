Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me see what each of the characterization techniques tells me. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options provided are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000, 1700, and 1650 cm^-1. The very broad peak around 3000 probably indicates O-H stretching, like from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a broad peak is more typical for an alcohol. Carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, but sometimes it's a bit lower in wavenumber. Also, if it were a carboxylic acid, maybe the absorption would be around 2500-3300, but maybe this is a different functional group.

Then, the 1700 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group. That's common in aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, etc. The 1650 cm^-1 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, it could indicate an amide, but since the options don't include nitrogen, that's probably not the case here.

Wait, considering the options, all the compounds are either alcohols, ketones, esters, etc., with O and maybe O2. Let's think about each possibility.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like CH2=CH or CH=CH groups. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene group. So, we can think of structures with alkenes, like esters with double bonds, or maybe a ketone with an alkene nearby.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is an interesting mass. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43, but wait, 45 is perhaps C3H7+ (45? Let me calculate: C is 12, H is 1. 3*12=36, 7H=7. Total 43. Hmm, but 45? Maybe it's another fragment. Or maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)2CO+? Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a mass of 58. No, that can't be. Wait, maybe (CH3)COO+ or something else.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be a CH3CH2O+ group, but that's 45? Let me check molecular weights. CH3CH2O+ is C2H5O+, molecular weight is (12*2) + (5*1) + 16 = 24 +5 +16=45. Yes! So the m/z 45 fragment is likely the ethoxy group as a
