Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided is the IR and 1H NMR spectrum of Compound X.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H or N-H stretch. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are probably aromatic ring vibrations (C=C stretching). So, putting this together, X is likely an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and possibly an alcohol or phenol group.

Wait, wait, but the O-H stretch can also be from a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, but sometimes it's in that range. But looking at the IR, there's a 3400-2500, which could be a broad O-H like a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol or phenol. But the presence of a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the aromatic peaks could suggest a substitution pattern on a benzene ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR of Compound X.

The NMR data points:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in D2O, the -OH might exchange and not show up, but if it's a sharp peak, it could be an -OH. But 10.5 is pretty upfield for a phenol. Wait, no, wait. Phenol protons are usually around 5-6 ppm. So 10.5 is more like a carboxylic acid -OH. But wait, sometimes in DMSO or other solvents, the O-H can be broad and appear around
