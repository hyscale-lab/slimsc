Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and they mentioned that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the probability must be zero outside this interval, which implies that this is the region where the particle exists — the support of the wave function. 

Wait, but wave functions must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1. But in this case, the particle isn't found outside x=1 and x=3, so the wave function should be zero outside that range. Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, this can't be right, because a wave function shouldn't have an imaginary part unless it's part of a complex function. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is actually given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some complex factor, but the way it's written here, it's a real part minus 0.5i. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as a complex number, but for it to be a valid wave function, it must satisfy the normalization condition.

Wait, but if the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, that seems problematic because the square of the absolute value would include (a^2)/(1+x) plus the 0.25 term. But let's think again. Maybe the wave function is actually ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) * e^(-iθ) or something, but the problem states it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems like a complex value. But perhaps the wave function is supposed to be written as a complex function, and the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is (-0.5). Hmm, but that would imply that the wave function doesn't depend on x for the imaginary part, which is a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read the question again.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a function of x, real and imaginary parts. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i.

Wait, but for a wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because outside this region, the wave function is zero (since no particle is found outside x <1 or x>3). So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

But wait, is the wave function given only in that interval, or is it non-zero elsewhere? The question states that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval. So ψ(x) is zero for x <1 and x>3, and is equal to (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i within x=1 to x=3. But wait, that can't be right, because then the wave function would have a constant imaginary part in the interval, which would complicate normalization. Alternatively, perhaps this is a mistake, and the wave function is actually purely real, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about normalization. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be 1. Because the wave function is zero outside this range.

So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Let me write it as ψ(x) = (a/(1+x)^0.5) ) - 0.5i. So the square of the absolute value would be (a/(1+x)^0.5 )² + (0.5)². Because for a complex number a + ib, the magnitude squared is a² + b². So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a is a constant, then integrating [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] from x=1 to x=3 would involve integrating 1/(1+x) which is ln(1+x), but also a constant term 0.25. So the integral would be a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.25*(3-1). Because integrating from 1 to 3: (3-1) is 2. So it would be a² ln(2) + 0.5.

But wait, the normalization condition is that the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to3 is 1. So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 * 2 = 1.

Wait 0.25 integrated over 2 units (3-1=2) is 0.5. So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is approximately this value. So the answer would be B.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in how I interpreted the wave function. The wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. But this would mean that the wave function is a complex number with real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part (-0.5). That's a constant imaginary part, which seems odd because the imaginary part would not depend on x. So perhaps I misread the wave function.

Wait another read: The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. That's correct. So the square of the absolute value is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Because (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 is a²/(1+x), and (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 (i^2) is -0.25, but since we take the magnitude squared, it's (real part)^2 plus (imaginary part)^2.

Wait, no, the imaginary part is -0.5, so the square is (0.5)^2.

So the integral is correct as above.

But wait another thing: The wave function would have a real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary constant. That seems strange because typically, the wave function can be complex, but having a constant imaginary part in the region where it's non-zero seems unusual. But perhaps it's correct, given the problem statement.

Thus, proceeding with the calculation, a is approximately 0.849, which is very close to option B, 0.85. So the correct answer should be B.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The problem states that no particles were found outside the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), meaning the wave function is zero outside this interval. Within \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), the wave function is non-zero, and the normalization condition must be satisfied:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The magnitude squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \ln(1 + x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \implies \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \implies \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \(a = 0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
