Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

So the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, melting point that low... like maybe something that's solid at room temp but just melts a bit lower. Or perhaps it's a solid that's near its melting point when cooled.

The product of X reacting with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry; I remember that something like LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent, but maybe it's another hydride or something else. Oh wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is a diatomic molecule with isotopes, like D2O? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is probably a noble gas because noble gases are monoatomic and have no charge. Alternatively, it could be something like CO2, but wait, CO has protons 28 (from C=6 and O=8, so 14 each, but that might not fit). Wait, no, if W's molecule is like H2O, but that's not monoatomic. Hmm, maybe W is a diatomic molecule but with each atom having equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about the possibilities.

Wait, any element where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons would be elements with equal p and n. Let's think about isotopes. For example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Or oxygen-16: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. But wait, if W is a molecule of a noble gas, like Ar (which is monoatomic), but then the molecule would just be Ar. Wait, but if W is a molecule like O2, each O atom has 8 protons. O2 has 16 protons total, and 16 neutrons (since each O-16 has 8 neutrons). So 16 protons and 1
