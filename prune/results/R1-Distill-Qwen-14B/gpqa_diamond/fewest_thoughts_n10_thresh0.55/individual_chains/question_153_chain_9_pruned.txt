Okay, I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Michael reaction. So, the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then leads to the addition product.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with their own reactions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's the enolate. Wait, no, actually, in the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile. Wait, wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester, so under basic conditions, like NaOEt, it would deprotonate to form an enolate. Or wait, maybe the acrylate is the Michael acceptor?

Hmm, the Michael donor is the nucleophile, and the acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate is the donor? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Dimethyl malonate is a good donor because it can form an enolate. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So the reaction is: the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, but how does the addition proceed? The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH- group attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the acrylate. Oh, wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=
