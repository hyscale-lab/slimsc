Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, sometimes metrics are written in terms of a conformal factor multiplied by the flat metric. Here, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So, the metric is conformally flat. That might simplify things because I remember that for a conformally flat metric, the area element can be found using a simple formula. The area in 2D is usually ∫∫ dx dy, but when you have a metric, you have to account for the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, right, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since this metric is diagonal and each component is multiplied by the same factor, the determinant would be the square of the conformal factor. So the area element dA would be sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) dx dy. Since g_{xy}=0 for off-diagonal terms, it's simpler.

Let me compute that. The metric tensor components are g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² is x² + y². The square root of that is 32/(4 - r²).

So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. But wait, the standard area in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. So maybe I should switch to polar coordinates for easier integration. Let's set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ.

So substituting, dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. The area would then be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to what? Well, the denominator 4 - r² must not be zero, so r² <4 → r <2. So the radial integration is from 0 to 2.

So the area A is ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32
