Okay, so I've got this question here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let's see what each clue tells me.

The question gives me four possible formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one based on the given data.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's very broad, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH groups can form strong hydrogen bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but alcohols don't have as broad a peak as carboxylic acids. Oh wait, another possibility is a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. Another strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is about right for a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical ketone. Maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone? Or maybe an acid. Wait, if there's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H would be a very broad peak, which we have.

But wait, looking at the possible formulas, the ones with two oxygens are C6H12O2 and C6H10O2. So maybe the compound has two oxygenated groups. Or maybe one of them is a carbonyl and another is an O-H.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl Hs are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests the molecule has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the structure likely has an alkene group and maybe an ester
