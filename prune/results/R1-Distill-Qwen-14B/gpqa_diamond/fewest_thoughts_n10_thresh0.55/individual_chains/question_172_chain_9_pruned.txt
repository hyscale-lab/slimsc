Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k_B T) ), right? Oh wait, I remember it's (E_i - E_j) divided by (k_B T), but I need to get the signs right. Because higher energy levels have lower populations if they're not degenerate, so if E_i is higher than E_j, then n_i is less than n_j.

In this problem, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. Let me think, in star_1, the higher energy level has more population. So, if the energy levels are E and E + delta E (delta E is 1.38e-23 J), then the population ratio is n_upper / n_lower.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe in star_1, the fraction of atoms in that higher energy level is twice that of star_2. So, n1 / n2 = 2.
