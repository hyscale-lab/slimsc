Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogen and oxygen counts. The possible answers are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Alright, let's start by looking at each piece of data given and see what each tells us.

First, the FTIR spectrum: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl group (C=O), possibly a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or something with conjugation, or an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. That makes me think of something like an ester with a double bond, or maybe a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

The mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what fragment would give that. 45 is a common mass. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has m/z 91, but that's higher. Wait, maybe it's a CH3CO+ fragment (acetate ion), which is (CH3CO) with a mass of 43. Or perhaps the fragment is something else. Alternatively, (CH2O) is 30, but 45 might come from a different group.

Wait, 45: let me calculate possible fragments. 45 could be CH3COOH (but that's 60). No, wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO- (acetate ion), which is 43? Wait, CH3COO- is 43: 12+1+12+16+16=43? Wait, wait, the formula for acetate is C2H3O2^–. Let me calculate: C=12*2=24, H=3*1=3, O=16*2=32. Total 24+3+32=59? No, wait, wait. No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Acetate is CH3COO–, which is C2H3O2^–. So each carbon is 12, so 2*12=24. Hydrogen: 3, so 3. Oxygen: 2*16=32. Total 24+3+32=59? No, wait, that can't be right because 12*2 is 24, plus 3 (hydrogen) is 27, plus 32 is 59. But that's 59, not 45. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking the wrong fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O+, like an ethylene oxide ion? Let's see: C2H4O has molecular weight 44 (since 2*12=24, 4=4, O=16; 24+4+16=44). Oh, so m/z 44 would be that. But the fragment is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility
