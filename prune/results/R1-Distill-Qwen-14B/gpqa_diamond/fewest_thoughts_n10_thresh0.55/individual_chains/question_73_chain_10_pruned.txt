Okay, so I have this problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to calculate two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So for the relative speed, I think I can't just subtract the two speeds normally because we're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't add like regular numbers. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh yeah, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/cÂ²). But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the one moving slower (0.5c), the relative speed of the faster one (0.6c) would be?

Wait, I think I might have gotten that reversed. Let me think. The problem is asking for the relative speed of the two astronauts. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or from
