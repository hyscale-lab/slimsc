Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The options are A, B, C, D with different r-values.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). The given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. Wait, isn't that the maximally mixed state for a qubit?

Wait, let me recall. The density matrix for a pure state |0> is |0><0|, right? Similarly for |1>. But when you have equal parts of both, that's a mixed state. The density matrix given here averages the two projectors, so each has weight 1/2. So rho = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

I think the maximally mixed state for a qubit is the completely mixed state, which for a single qubit is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix. Oh wait, because the identity matrix for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]], so dividing by 2 gives [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. That makes sense because the trace should be 1, which it is: 0.5 + 0.5 =1.

Now, how does this relate to the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states? I remember that any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|, and the Bloch vector r is such that rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, if rho is (I)/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That would imply that r·σ = 0. Since σ is the vector of Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz), the only way their sum multiplied by r is zero is if r itself is zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the completely mixed state has zero coherence and is equally likely in |0> and |1>, so it
