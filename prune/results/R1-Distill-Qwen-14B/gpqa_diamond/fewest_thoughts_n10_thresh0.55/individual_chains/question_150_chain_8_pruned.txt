Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is 0 here. So (2*8+2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond (1), and maybe an amine or something else. But wait, the formula has an O, so maybe an aldehyde or ketone. Or maybe a nitro group? No, the O is probably part of something else.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's break this down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating for 1H. That seems really upfield for an aldehyde proton. Wait
