Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A. The setup says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, so Ay = c * S. Let me write out what S looks like. S is a 2x2 matrix:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So then, if c is h/(4π), then Ay would be:

[ 0     -(h/(4π))i ]
[ (h/(4π))i  0 ]

Wait, no, because c is multiplied by each element of S? Or is S defined as a matrix with elements scaled by something else? Wait, no, the matrix S is given as:

S = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So when you multiply by c, it's c * S, meaning each element is multiplied by c. So Ay becomes:

Ay = c * S => [ [0* c, (-i)*c], [i*c, 0] ]

So c is h/(4π), so Ay becomes:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

Eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I ) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) )) )

Calculating determinant:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. Because i
