Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because I thought qubit state space is two-dimensional, right? Oh wait, maybe it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Yeah, Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, which is a 2D sphere embedded in 3D space. So, the density matrix's position would correspond to a point on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices for mixed states can be inside the Bloch sphere too. Oh right, pure states are on the surface, mixed states are inside.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. I remember that |0> is [1; 0] and |1> is [0; 1], so:

|0><0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding these together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Wait, what does this represent? The diagonal entries are both 0.5. For a density matrix, the diagonal elements represent the probabilities of the qubit being in state |0> and |1> respectively. So this state is a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So it's a completely mixed state.

Now, how does this translate to the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the Bloch vector representation of a density matrix. The general form for a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x,y,z), and its magnitude is ≤1.

Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z.

So our ρ is (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute it. I is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I + r·σ)/2 becomes (1/2)[[1 + z, x - iy],[x + iy,1 - z]]. Comparing this to our given ρ, which is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], I can set up equations.

Looking at the diagonal elements first: (1 + z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + z = 1 → z = 0. Similarly, (1 - z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - z = 1 → z = 0. So z is zero. Now the off-diagonal elements: (x - iy)/2 = 0 → x = 0 and y = 0. Because the off-diagonal in our given ρ is zero, the real and imaginary parts must each be zero.

So the Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z) = (0,0,0). That means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Wait, but the origin is the completely mixed state. Because in the Bloch sphere, the pure states are on the surface with r having length 1, and mixed states are inside. The maximum mixed state, where the state is completely random, is the origin. So in this case, our density matrix is the completely mixed state, so its Bloch vector is (0,0,0
