Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function should satisfy certain conditions, like the normalization condition. Right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

So, the particle is found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region, I guess. Because when they measured, particles weren't found outside x<1 or x>3. So the wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that form looks a bit strange. Oh wait, maybe the i is in the denominator? Let me check the question again. Oh, no, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because the wave function should be a complex function, but perhaps the expression is written as a function that has a real part and an imaginary part. So maybe it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) plus (-0.5i).
