Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass, which is itself moving at a constant velocity. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with light moving through different media, the speed changes based on the refractive index. The basic formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum (given as 1 here), and n is the refractive index of the medium. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer.

But in this problem, the glass itself is moving. So I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Oh wait, wait. Special relativity, right. Because velocities don't just add up linearly when they get close to the speed of light. But wait, is the glass moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through it. How do these velocities combine?

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the original frame, and u' is the velocity in the new frame. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, in special relativity, when you have two frames moving relative to each other at velocity v, the velocity of an object in the new frame is given by u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, I need to add the velocities correctly.

Wait, no. Let me think about it again. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at velocity v_light = c/n in the glass's rest frame. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

So according to the velocity
