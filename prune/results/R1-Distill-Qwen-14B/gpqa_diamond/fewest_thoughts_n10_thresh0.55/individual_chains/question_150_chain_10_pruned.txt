Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, so maybe I can figure out the structure from that. The reagents are a series of reactions, and I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let's break down the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I remember that in NMR, the integration numbers tell us how many protons are present. So each peak's integration is the number of Hs.

Looking at the peaks:

1. 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

2. 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) with 2H. These could be aromatic protons. Maybe they're part of a benzene ring. The coupling as a doublet suggests they're adjacent to another set of Hs in the ring.

3. 6.51 ppm is also a doublet with 2H. Another aromatic ring maybe? Or perhaps substituents on the same ring?

4. 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals can be from exchangeable protons, like -OH groups. Or maybe it's some vinyl protons that are split in a way that looks broad. But in this context, considering the other peaks, maybe it's an -OH group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent) plus a double bond or ring elsewhere, and maybe an aldehyde group (which is a double bond).

So the structure might have a benzene ring and an aldehyde group, perhaps with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR again: the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm. The aromatic protons: 6.98 and 6.51. Maybe it's para-substituted on a benzene ring. Let's say two substituents each on two benzene rings? Or perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets. In a para-substituted benzene, the protons on either side would typically be as
