Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. The key is to figure out which can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that both these spectrographs are high-resolution, but each has different magnitude limits for observation.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter. Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I might have that backwards. Oh wait, no: in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, a star with magnitude 5 is brighter than one with 10. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17 mag (since a higher magnitude is fainter, so stars with magnitude ≤17 are bright enough to be seen).

Wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO: stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter (i.e., less than 17), then ESPRESSO can see it. So the limit is V ≤17. Similarly for HIRES: brighter than 16 mag, so V ≤16.

So each star's apparent V magnitude (after considering any extinction) must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Oh, but wait, some stars have extinction (like E(B-V) given), so their apparent magnitude is dimmed. So we have to calculate their apparent V magnitude after correcting for extinction.

Wait, the question says for Star3 and Star4, E(B-V) is given. The extinction in the V band is calculated using E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1, because Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). That's the formula I remember. So the apparent magnitude observed (m) is the intrinsic magnitude (M) plus distance modulus plus extinction.

Wait, the apparent magnitude m is given by the formula: m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5
