Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so they have the same mass-radius ratio. But I don't know if mass directly affects the luminosity here. Hmm, wait, the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. Oh right, so black body radiation depends on temperature and radius, I think. Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, those are the wavelengths corresponding to their peak emissions, which depends on their temperatures. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same because of Wien's law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant. So if λ is same for both, then T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem also gives their radial velocities. Star 1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star 2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, so if a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if moving away, redshifted (longer wavelength). But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But wait, their intrinsic (rest) wavelengths might be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest, which would be the observed wavelengths. So for Star 1, if it's at rest, its observed peak is λ1. For Star 2, moving at 700 km/s, perhaps towards us or away. Wait, what's the direction? Because velocity is given as 700 km/s, but the sign would matter. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Hmm, but which way? Oh, the problem says Star_1 is 0, Star_2 is 700. Oh, but in which direction? Because the Doppler shift depends on
