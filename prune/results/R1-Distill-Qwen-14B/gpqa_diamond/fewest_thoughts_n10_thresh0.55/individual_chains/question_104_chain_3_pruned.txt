Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the RV measurements.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves towards and away from us because of the planet's gravity, right? So the shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity.

The problem says that for Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to the orbital period. Oh, right, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( (1) / (P * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ? Hmm, wait, maybe I should recall the simplified version when M_planet is much less than M_star, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun's.

In that case, the formula simplifies to K ≈ (v) = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / (c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ), assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on, maximum effect).

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass. So M_p is the same, M_s is same for both. So K would be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Or, more precisely, K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are different. K for planet 1
