Okay, let me try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, it's about the rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate and see which one matches.

First, I remember that the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor, considering bond vibrations. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state with the least possible energy. Probably the next vibrational state or maybe a rotational state, but I'm a bit confused about which one comes first.

Wait, the problem mentions that the model is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are a combination of both. But when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule's symmetry). Wait, no, the rigid rotor has J=0 as the lowest rotational state. Oh, but for diatomic molecules, the rotational quantum number starts at J=0, and the vibrational starts at v=0.

But how does the energy transition work when a photon is absorbed? The
