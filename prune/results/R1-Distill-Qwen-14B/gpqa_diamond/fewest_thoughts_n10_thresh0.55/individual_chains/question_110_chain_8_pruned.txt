Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key point is about their apparent V magnitudes because each instrument has a different brightness limit.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than V=16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16. So to be detected by both, the star must have an apparent magnitude better than or equal to 17 (since 16 is brighter than 17, but wait no, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. Oh right, higher magnitude means dimmer. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. Wait, no. Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. Wait, wait, brightness and magnitude are inversely related. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So if a star has an apparent magnitude (V) of 16, it's brighter than 17. So for a star to be observed by both, it must have V ≤16, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, meaning it can include anything brighter (V ≤17) and HIRES can only go up to 16. So the star must have V ≤16 to be observed by both.

Wait, no. Wait, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's V ≤17. So stars with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. And for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag, so V ≤16. So for both, the star must be V ≤16. So any star that's V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think
