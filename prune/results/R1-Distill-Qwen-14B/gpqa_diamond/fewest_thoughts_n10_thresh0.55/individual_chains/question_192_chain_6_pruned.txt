Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which means it's hollow. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

The options are four different expressions, all involving 1/(4πε₀) multiplied by q over some squared distance or combination.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, any internal charges would be... wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, but then there's a charge +q placed inside the cavity. So what happens?

I think about Gauss's Law here. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surfaces. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so when a charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral, but when you put a charge inside the cavity, it's like the conductor shields the outside from the internal charge. Because the conductor is uncharged, the internal charge +q will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance it. No, wait, wait. If the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think. The conductor is neutral before the charge is placed. When you place a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's free electrons will move. The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, because the
