Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. We're given that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the metal is tightly bound.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think Ca^2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. The formula would be something like CaY^2-? Because EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form, but when it binds Ca^2+, it might lose some protons.

So, the complex is CaY^2- with a concentration of 0.02 M. Now, the question is, what's the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution?

I think this involves the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and Y^4- (or maybe HEDTA?), but since the pH is ideal, maybe we don't have to worry about the protonation states. Alternatively, perhaps the EDTA is in the form that can release Ca^2+ when the complex dissociates.

The reaction would be: CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4- (or maybe Y^3- or another form, but I think for this problem, we can model it as a simple dissociation: CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-).

The stability constant K is given as 5e10. Wait, the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But wait, the formation reaction is Ca^2+ + Y^4- → CaY^2-; so K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca
