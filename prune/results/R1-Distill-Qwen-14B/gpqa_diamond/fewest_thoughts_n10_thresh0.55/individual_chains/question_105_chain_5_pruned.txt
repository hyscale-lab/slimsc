Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun but with some spots on it. The setup is that one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface area. The star itself has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing variations in brightness that we observe. The kicker is that this scenario can mimic the presence of an exoplanet, and the question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

So, the main goal is to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. I remember that the light curve variation caused by a planet is due to the transit method, where the planet blocks some of the star's light as it passes in front. The deeper the dip in brightness, the larger the planet relative to the star.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't being transited by a planet but has spots that modulate its brightness. So the problem is about comparing the two scenarios: the brightness variation from the spots and the one from a planet transit.

Let me think about each effect separately.

First, the star with spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the brightness decreases because that area is emitting less light. The total brightness variation (delta L) depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

The star's total luminosity without any spots would be L = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But with spots, the effective temperature isn't uniform. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, it's 20%, so f = 0.2.

The star's luminosity when spots are present would be L_obs = L * (1 - f) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * L_star? Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, L is proportional to R² T^4. So each part of the star contributes based on its area and temperature. The total luminosity when spots are present would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

So, without spots, L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

With spots, L_total = L*(1 - f) * (Teff^4 / Teff^4) + f*(T_spot^4 / Teff^4)*L/ (R²? Wait, no, the area is R². Let me better compute each part.

The spotted area is f * (surface area of the star). The surface area is 4πR², so the spotted area is 4πR² * f.

Each unit area of the star emits σT^
