Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be calculated using energy conservation. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I'll have to think about how that changes things.

The problem gives me mass m, maximum amplitude A, and says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a standard harmonic oscillator setup, but relativistic effects come into play. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the energy is conserved between kinetic and potential. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0) is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistically, the energy equation changes. The total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I think the approach is to equate the total mechanical energy to the relativistic energy.

In the oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², but wait, in relativity, does the potential energy formula change? I'm not sure. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², and that should still hold because it's the restoring force. So at x = A, potential energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic.

So the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA². And in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². Therefore, E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at the equilibrium is the relativistic kinetic energy. Let me think: when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy KE = (gamma - 1)
