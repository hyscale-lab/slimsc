Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, the target molecule. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexane ring connected to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no. Let me see: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) suggests that the substituent is a methyl group where one R is cyclohexyl and the other is hydroxyl. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). And the cyclohexane also has a carbonyl group, so it's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, if I imagine the molecule, it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents on the same carbon: a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl which is also attached to another cyclohexane ring, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, no, maybe it's a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps it's a single cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group, which in turn has a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group attached. And the same carbon has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-Câ‰¡C-). So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached.

Now, the target is to introduce a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde. Hmm.

Let me think about the steps needed. So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, I probably need to
