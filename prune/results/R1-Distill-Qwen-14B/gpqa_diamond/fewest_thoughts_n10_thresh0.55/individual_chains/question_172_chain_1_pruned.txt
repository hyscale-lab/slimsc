Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the outermost layer of a star where light is emitted. So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2. And it's assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small region of the photosphere is in equilibrium with its surroundings. So I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states in a system. I remember the formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the ratio of the populations would be N_upper/N_lower = exp( -Î”E/(kT) ). But wait, in this case, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, does that mean the population of the excited state is twice as much in star_1?

Wait, actually, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star
