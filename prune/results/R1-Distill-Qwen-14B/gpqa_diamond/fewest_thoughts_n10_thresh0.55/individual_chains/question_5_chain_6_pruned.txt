Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, so the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Hmm. So the operator P itself would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector components. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction has components (nx, 0, nz), right? So the operator P along direction n would be P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, no, actually, the components are vectors, and the operator along n would be the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices (since the components are given in terms of σx, σy, σz). Because in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators can be expressed as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices when dealing with spin-1/2 particles like the muon.

Oh wait, but in this case, the operator P is given as the sum of the components. Let me think. So the full operator P along n is P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.

But wait, the components Px, Py, Pz are given as specific 2x2 matrices. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along n would be nx * Px + nz * Pz.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P.

Wait, in spin systems, the eigenstates of the spin operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. The eigenvalues are
