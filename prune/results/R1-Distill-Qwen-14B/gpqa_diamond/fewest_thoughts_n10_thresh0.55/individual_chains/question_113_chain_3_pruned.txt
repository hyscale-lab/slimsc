Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out which one matches the data.

First, I'll go through each piece of data one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum: It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Alcohols also have a broad peak, but maybe it's a bit less so. So maybe it's a carbonyl group, but that's usually around 1700 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, the question says there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 is a little lower; that might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps an amide, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, but if there's a broad peak at 3000, that's probably O-H. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak. Also, in the FTIR, sometimes if there's a carbonyl and an O-H, it might lead to hydrogen bonding, but I'm not sure how that affects the peaks.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. So, maybe there's an allylic structure or some conjugation.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, like the CH₂CO⁺
