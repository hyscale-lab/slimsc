Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when atoms are in different energy levels, the excitation relates to temperature somehow. Oh wait, this is about Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution must apply here.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is proportional to the number of atoms in that energy state. I think the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight and ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait, but the problem gives the energy difference between the levels as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the ΔE in the Boltzmann factor.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper level (say level 2) to the lower level (level 1) is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So does that mean N2/N1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or maybe N2_1 / N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2)?

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it's that the excitation (number in the specific level) is twice. So the ratio N2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2's N2. Let me clarify variables.

Let me denote for star 1: N2_1, and star 2: N2_2. The statement says N2_1 = 2 * N2_2.

But wait, the ratio N2/N1 would be different for each star. Wait, no, for each star, the ratio of the excited state (N2) to some lower state (maybe the ground state, but not necessarily) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? So ΔE is the same for both. So for each star, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to set up the ratios for each star.

For star 1: (N2_1)/(N1_1) = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star 2: (N2_2)/(N1_2) = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But wait, since for each star, the ratio N2/N1 would be (g2/g1) multiplied by that exponential. But the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But wait, are N1_1 and N1_2 the same? Or do they depend on the same ratio?

Wait, maybe it's better to assume that both stars have the same element (iron) and the same energy levels, so g2/g1 is the same for both. So the ratio N2/N1 will depend only on T.

Wait, but if the question is only about the excitation level of a specific energy level, perhaps it's the population of that level compared to another. So for each star, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But the problem states that N_2 (the population of that specific level) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So N2_1 = 2 N2_2.

But wait, what's N2_1 and N2_2? Let me think. For each star, the number in the excited state is N2, and perhaps the same for both stars. Or maybe each star's N2 is relative to their own N1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the ratio of the two stars' N2_1 and N2_2.

Wait, let's define for each star: N2_i / N1_i = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T_i ) )

So for star_1, N2_1/N1_1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, N2_2/N1_2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the excitation of the specific level is twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. So I think N2_1 = 2 N2_2.

Wait, but wait, the N2's are relative to their own N1's. So perhaps the ratio of N2_1/N1_1 is twice the ratio N2_2/N1_2.

Wait, that would make sense. Because if the excitation is higher, the ratio of the excited level to another (lower) level is higher. So N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2 )

But then, considering the Boltzmann factors, that would imply:

(g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Ah, because (g2/g1) is the same for both, we can cancel that.

So exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let's factor this differently. Let me compute the terms:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = [ T1 - T2 ] / ( T1 T2 )

So putting that back:

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But wait, the left-hand side becomes ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) = ln(2)

Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and I know that k (Boltzmann constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that number is exactly the same as the given ΔE. So let me plug that in.

ΔE = k * T => Hmm, wait, no, let's compute ΔE/(k) = T? No, wait: if ΔE = k * something.

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting into our equation:

(1 K) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (1/(1 K)):

[ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2) / 1 K

Wait, but units? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to get the right equation.

So we have (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/k )

But since ΔE = k * T, no, wait: wait, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k*(1 K), since k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/k = 1 K.

So our equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) / (1 K) * (1 K) ? Wait, no, because the units would need to work out.

Wait, let me not get tripped up. The equation after substitution is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) / (ΔE/k )^{-1}?

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed without plugging in the numbers.

Wait, from earlier, [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE

Since ΔE is given, and k is known, but in the options, the equation is without any constants.

Hmm, but the problem is asking for an equation that relates T1 and T2. So the equation we have is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so k/ΔE = 1/K * (J/K)/(J) )= 1/K * (1/(J)) * J = 1/K * K = 1.

Wait, no, perhaps let's compute k/ΔE:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K,

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J,

so k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) )= (1 J/K) / (1 J) ) * 1/K * K? Wait, no, just 1/(K) * (J/K) / J → (J/K)/(J) )= 1/K.

Wait, no, for units: (J/K) / J = 1/K. So k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) )= (1 J/K) / (1 J) )= (1/(J)) * J/K → Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, regardless, the equation we have is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

But since ΔE = k * 1 K, because ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k*(1 K), then k/ΔE = 1/(1 K) → 1/K.

So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K → ln(2)

Wait, no, because (k/ΔE) is (1.38e-23 J/K)/(1.38e-23 J) )= 1/K.

So we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K )

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because K would be in denominator. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again. The equation we derived was:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE

Since k = 1.38e-23 J/K and ΔE = 1.38e-23 J,

k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) = 1 K^{-1}

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1})

But the left side has units of (K^(-1)) because:

(T1 - T2) is in K,

T1 T2 is K^2,

so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) → (K) / (K^2) = 1/K.

But the right side is ln(2) * (1/K^{-1})? Wait, no, because k/ΔE is 1/K.

Wait, but ln(2) is dimensionless. So the equation becomes:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) → Wait, but K is in denominator, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on units here, but perhaps I can ignore units for the sake of the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the way the equation is written. Let me write the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

Since k=ΔE, because k=1.38e-23 J/K and ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, so k/ΔE = 1.38e-23 J/K / 1.38e-23 J = 1/(K), but that's 1/K.

Wait, but since ΔE = k * T, where T is some temperature. Wait, but in this case, ΔE = k * 1 K, because k*(1 K) = 1.38e-23 J.

So, (k/ΔE) = 1/(1 K) = 1/K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2) * (1/K) → But that's not possible because the left side is 1/K, and the right is ln(2) / K.

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers, the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But the options don't have any constants, so perhaps the equation is in terms of ln(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which would mean:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as our equation except for the k/ΔE factor. Wait, but from our equation, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

Wait, but since k = ΔE, then (k/ΔE) = 1, so the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, that makes sense now. Because if k = ΔE, then (k/ΔE) is 1, so ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.


The problem involves two stars where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution applies, and the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this ratio:

\[
\frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_2}{g_1} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
