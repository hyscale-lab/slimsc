Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is in H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction is doing. Let's take the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2COâ€”methylacetone. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN^-), acting as a nucleophile.

So, the reaction is between a ketone and a cyanide. I think this is a nucleophilic addition. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN^- via nucleophilic attack, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Because the mechanism would be the ketone (C=O) being attacked by CN^-, then protonation, then elimination of water, but wait, no, because adding a nucleophile to a ketone gives a secondary alcohol. So, the initial product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait,
