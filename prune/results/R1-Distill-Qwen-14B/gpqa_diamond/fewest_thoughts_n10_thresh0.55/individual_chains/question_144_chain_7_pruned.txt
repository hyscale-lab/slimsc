Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through. 

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I need to calculate the mean distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance relates to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I find tau from the given width Γ?

I think the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ (width) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The formula I recall is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, since ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me think about the units to make sure.

Wait, Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Right. So to find tau, I can compute ħ divided by Γ. But I have to make sure the units are compatible. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, right
