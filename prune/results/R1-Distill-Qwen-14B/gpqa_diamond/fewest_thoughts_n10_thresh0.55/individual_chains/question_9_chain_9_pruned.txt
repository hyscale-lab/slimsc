Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is about the different operations that leave the molecule looking the same. The notation C3h... wait, what's the C3h point group? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. It includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So the molecule should have a three-way rotation and a mirror plane that's not perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options, there are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

I'll go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I'm trying to visualize its structure. Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group has a methyl branch. The structure is symmetric because each substituent is the same. So the molecule should have a three-fold axis, right? Wait, what about mirror planes? If it's symmetric with three identical groups, maybe it has a C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If the molecule is trigonal planar around boron, then a C3 axis is present. But mirror planes... I'm not sure. Maybe it has a C3v symmetry instead, which would have a vertical mirror plane. Or perhaps it's C3h. Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so the symmetry group would be C3v, I think. Because C3v has a three-fold rotation and three vertical mirror planes, not a horizontal one. So maybe C3v, which doesn't match C3h. So perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. I remember that its structure is similar to norbornane but with a nitrogen. The molecule has a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine's structure has a three-membered bridge, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine is a tricyclic compound, right? It's a bridge with three bridges, making it have a three-fold symmetry. Or maybe not. Let me think. No, quinuclidine has two bridgeheads. Wait, no, I think it has a three-membered ring and a bridge, but the symmetry might be lower. Alternatively, I remember that quinuclidine has a C3 axis. For example, if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Now, does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm
