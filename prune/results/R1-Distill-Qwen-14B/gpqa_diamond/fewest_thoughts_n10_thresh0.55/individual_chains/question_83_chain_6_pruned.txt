Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I've studied titration curves before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think carefully.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³? That makes sense because 20 + 20 is 40.

Diluting the acetic acid will change its concentration. I remember that concentration changes when you dilute; the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L. After dilution, V2 is 0.040 L. Let's calculate the new concentration.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. I think that means we've added 25% of the required volume of NaOH to reach the equivalence point.

Wait, to find the equivalence point, I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to neutralize the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll react in a 1:1 mole ratio.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.040 L. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration
