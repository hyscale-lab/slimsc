Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which is the same as N ∝ d^5.

Wait, so number of stars is proportional to distance to the fifth power. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, that's the derivative, I think. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with respect to d would be proportional to 5d^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So maybe they're asking for the rate of change, like dN/dr. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So the change
