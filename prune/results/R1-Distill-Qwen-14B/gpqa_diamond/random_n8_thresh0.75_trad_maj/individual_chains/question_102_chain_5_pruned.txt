Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and some experiments done with it. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

First, the setup: There's a ligand-receptor pair initially found in neural crest cells. The researcher is trying to understand their developmental fate. So, they've created a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre technology.

The vector has two coding regions: one for the ligand and one for the receptor. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the vector is probably set up so that each gene is expressed separately but under the same transcriptional unit, I think. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the expression of the downstream gene. So, the setup might be that the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF.

Wait, let me visualize the construct. The vector is bicistronic, so it should have two ORFs in one transcript. So, the transcription would start with the CBA promoter, then the ligand ORF, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF. After the ligand is the stop cassette with loxP, and after the receptor is another stop cassette with lox2272.

Wait, but the ligand is at the 5' position, so perhaps the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (with stop in loxP cassette) -> IRES -> receptor ORF (with stop in lox2272) -> eGFP.

Wait, no, the question says the ligand is at the 5' and fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. Hmm, maybe the vector is ligand-ORF followed by the receptor-ORF. But with the stops in certain cassettes.

Wait, the stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So, when Cre is present, it will excise the loxP or lox2272 cassettes.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry; the stop is in a loxP cassette between ligand and mCherry. So, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only if the loxP is excised. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP, but there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So, the receptor-eGFP fusion would be expressed only if the lox2272 cassette is excised.

So, without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. The receptor
