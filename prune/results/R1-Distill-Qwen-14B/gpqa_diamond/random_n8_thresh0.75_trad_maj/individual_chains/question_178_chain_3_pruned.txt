Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric tensor and F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think.

Wait, wait. Wait, F^{μν} is the field tensor, which for electromagnetism is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. But wait, this Lagrangian looks like it's an interaction term, perhaps between a Dirac fermion (since ψ is a spinor) and a gauge field. Oh, like a Dirac equation interaction with a vector potential, maybe like in QED. But in this case, the Lagrangian seems different.

Wait, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is a second-order term in the spinor fields. Oh, because σ_{μν} involves the commutators of gamma matrices. So this might be a term that's quadratic in the spinor fields. But then it's multiplied by F^{μν}, which is a field strength tensor, so a term involving the field strength.

Wait, but in terms of renormalizability, it depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ. So I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

To find the mass dimension, I should consider the dimensions of each part in the Lagrangian. Remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ=1), and the integral d^4 x would have dimension -4 (since each x has dimension -1), so the Lagrangian density L must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4.

Let me compute the dimensions of each part. First, ψ is a spinor, which has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be dimension 3/2. The σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're matrices, not operators with dimensions). So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which has the same dimension as the derivative, because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each derivative has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1.

So let me compute the dimensions step by step.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. F^{μν} has dimension 1. So the whole term is κ multiplied by 3 + 1 = 4? Wait, no: wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the product of these terms would be (3/2) * (dimensionless) * (3/2) * (1) )? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) * (3/2) ) = 9/4? No, wait, no. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ has 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has (3/2) + (3/2) ) = 3? Because each ψ contributes 3/2, and σ is 0. So 3/2 + 3/2 is 3. Then multiplied by F^{μν} which is dimension 1. So the entire term is 3 + 1
