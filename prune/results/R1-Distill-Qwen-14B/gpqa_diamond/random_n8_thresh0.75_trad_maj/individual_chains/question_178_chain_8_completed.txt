Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question gives me the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the gamma matrices. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Oh right, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is found by looking at the dimensions of each component. The Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x (which has dimension -4) requires the Lagrangian to be dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let's break down the term: κ, ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

I remember the fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ is also 3/2. The F tensor is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or Yang-Mills, right? F^{μν} is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. Each derivative has mass dimension 1. So F has dimension 2 because it's ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each F^{μν} is dimension 2.

Now σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices and their commutators. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives or fields. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless? Or wait, no, because it's a product of gamma matrices but in a commutator. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ must be dimensionless too.

Putting it all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F. Let's sum the dimensions. ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2. So sum is 3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2 = 3/2 * 2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5. But the entire term must have dimension 4 because it's in the Lagrangian. So κ must have dimension 4 -5= -1. So κ has mass dimension -1. That would make the term dimension 4, which is correct.

Now, is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. In 4 dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension ≥ 0. If the dimension is negative, it's non-renormalizable. Because higher dimension operators have higher powers of the momentum, leading to worse UV behavior.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the dimension of the coupling in the interaction term determines renormalizability. So for the interaction term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ, the dimension of κ is [κ] = -1. So negative. So the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. Because in 4D, renormalizable theories require couplings with dimension ≤ 4 - n, where n is the sum of fields in the term, but wait, maybe I should think about it another way.

Wait, in general, the mass dimension of the coupling constant in a term is given by [g] = d - (sum of fields' dimensions). So for a term g ψ^m ψ^†^n, etc.

But here, our term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me count the fields: each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So sum of fields' dimensions is 3/2 + 3/2 (from ψ̄ and ψ) plus 2 (from F). So 3/2 *2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. The term is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

In terms of renormalizability, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥ 0. Because in a renormalizable theory, the interaction terms have coupling constants with mass dimension ≥0 so that the perturbation series doesn't require infinite terms (nonrenormalizable terms have higher dimension couplings leading to bad UV behavior).

Since κ has dimension -1, which is less than 0, the theory is nonrenormalizable. So the options are looking for whether the theory is renormalizable.

Looking back at the options: option A says [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, that can't be right because κ is negative. Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. That fits. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable. No. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. Breaking down the dimensions of each component:
- \(\bar{\psi}\) and \(\psi\) are fermion fields, each with mass dimension \(3/2\).
- \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is dimensionless.
- \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is the field strength tensor, which has mass dimension 2 (as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field \(A\), and each derivative has mass dimension 1).

Summing the dimensions of the fields in the term:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has mass dimension \(\geq 0\). Here, \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable** because the interaction term introduces higher-dimensional operators that lead to poor ultraviolet behavior.

### Step 3: Analyzing the options
- **Option A:** Incorrect. While \([\kappa]_M = -1\), the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. \([\kappa]_M = 1\) is inconsistent with the calculation.
- **Option C:** Correct. \([\kappa]_M = -1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. \([\kappa]_M = 1\) is inconsistent, and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.

Answer: C
