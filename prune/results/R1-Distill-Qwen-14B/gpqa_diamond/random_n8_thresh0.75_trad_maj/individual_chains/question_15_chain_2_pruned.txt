Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are Earth-like and already detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Hmm, the key here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit. Specifically, a smaller star makes transits more likely because the planet has a higher chance of passing in front of it. Also, a closer planet (smaller orbital distance) increases the probability because the star appears smaller in the sky, so the planet has a higher chance of blocking the light.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The transit probability (P) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is semi-major axis (orbital distance). Or wait, maybe it's different. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the orbital distance (a) relative to the star's size. Or perhaps it's more about the orbital distance in terms of the star's radius.

Wait, let's think about the transit geometry. The probability that a planet transits is roughly the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the planet's orbit. More accurately, the probability is (R_star / a)^2, but wait no, I think it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. Oh wait, the main factor is the alignment, but given that they've already been detected via RV, I think their orbital planes are likely edge-on. Or wait, RV detects planets because of their Doppler shift, which requires that their orbits are at least somewhat edge-on, but perhaps not exactly 90 degrees. Hmm, but for the purpose of this question, perhaps the RV method gives us information that affects the transit probability.

Wait no, the question says that both planets have already been detected via RV method, which allows them to know their
