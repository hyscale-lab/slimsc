Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states to temperature.

So the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me think, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for the same energy level. So maybe the energy levels are the same, but the populations are different. Let me clarify: if the energy difference between the levels is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, then the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_upper) to the lower (n_lower) depends on temperature.

Wait, the question says the atoms are twice as excited. Oh, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2, and for star_2, n_upper2 / n_lower2 = let's say x. But I'm not sure what x is. Wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited compared to star_2. So maybe star_1 has a higher excitation, so perhaps the ratio is higher. Wait, perhaps the question is that for a given energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the excitation potential is the same, but the temperature affects the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should define it properly. Let me think: for each star, the ratio of the excited to ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio would be (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star 2, it's (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron
