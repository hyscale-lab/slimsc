Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So first, I need to figure out what that nucleus is.

Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So protons are 3, neutrons 3, so A is 6. Oh right, that makes it Carbon-6? No, wait, no, Carbon has atomic number 6. Oh wait, no, lithium is Z=3, so 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so the mass number is 6. So the isotope is Li-6? Wait, no, Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but that's for the isotope Li-6. Wait, but I think I might be getting confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So that's the nucleus in question here. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the mass number A is 6. Now, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed is 0.96c. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy equation.

The equation for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I'm not sure if I'm given the rest mass energy or the kinetic energy. Oh, wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy. Because in colliders, they usually talk about the kinetic energy imparted to the particles.

Wait, no, wait. RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high energies, and when they collide, their energy contributes to the creation of quark-gluon plasma. But in terms of the problem, the question is about the total energy or the kinetic energy. Hmm, the formula for kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m0 c². So I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think the energy here refers to the total energy, which is gamma*m0*c². But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check both possibilities, but I think in this context, the energy is the total energy.

So the first step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since it's a nucleus, we can model it as a particle with mass m = M * u, where u is the atomic mass unit. But I might need the exact mass in kilograms or in terms of energy.

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately
