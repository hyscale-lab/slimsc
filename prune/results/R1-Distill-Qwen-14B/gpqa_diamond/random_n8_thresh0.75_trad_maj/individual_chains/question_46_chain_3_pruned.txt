Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for alkene metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkyl groups between alkenes. Grubbs is typically a transition metal catalyst, like ruthenium-based, and it's used in olefin metathesis. So when Grubbs is used, the alkene breaks and reform, swapping the ends.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, the structure of that. Let me draw it. Pentene has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait. No, wait. Wait, I think I messed that up. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is from C1 to C2, and the substituents are on C3. Let me write it correctly.

Numbering starts from the end with the double bond. So 1,2-diene. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, the formula is, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl on C3. So CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3) or wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the parent chain is five carbons, double bond starts at carbon 1. So it's (CH2)2CHCH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3) ? Hmm, wait no, the substituent on C3 is a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH
