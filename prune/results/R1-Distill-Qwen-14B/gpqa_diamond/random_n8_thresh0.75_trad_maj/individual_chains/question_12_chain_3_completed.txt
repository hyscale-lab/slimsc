Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options are provided, and I'll have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, conservation laws come into play. Specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the decay products must cancel each other out. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are massless or have very tiny mass compared to other particles. The muon has a rest mass of about 105.7 MeV. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So, the decay is possible because the pion's mass is larger than the muon's, so there's enough energy.

I think the total energy available for the decay products is the rest mass energy of the pion. So, the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should be equal to the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. But wait, the muon and neutrino also have their rest energies. The neutrino is massless (or practically so), so its energy is just its kinetic energy. The muon, on the other hand, has a rest mass energy of 105.7 MeV, plus its kinetic energy.

So, let me formalize this. Let me denote:
- M_pi = 139.6 MeV (rest mass of pion)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV (rest mass of muon)
- E_mu = energy of muon
- E_nu = energy of neutrino
- K_mu = kinetic energy of muon = E_mu - m_mu
- K_nu = kinetic energy of neutrino = E_nu (since its rest mass is negligible)

Conservation of energy gives:
E_mu + E_nu = M_pi

Conservation of momentum gives:
Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. Let me denote the magnitude as p.

So, for the muon, E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. But since units are in MeV and masses are in MeV/c², I think the equation simplifies. Let me write it as E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ). Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since for massless particles, E = pc.

Wait, but in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), then E = sqrt(p² + m²) for the muon, and E = p for the neutrino. So, the energies are related through p.

So, putting it all together:

E_mu + E_nu = M_pi
sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = M_pi

Let me solve this equation for p. Let me set x = p for simplicity.

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = M_pi

Subtract x from both sides:
sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = M_pi - x

Now, square both sides:
x² + m_mu² = (M_pi - x)^2
x² + m_mu² = M_pi² - 2 M_pi x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:
m_mu² = M_pi² - 2 M_pi x

Rearranging:
2 M_pi x = M_pi² - m_mu²

So,
x = (M_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 M_pi)

Let me compute that.

M_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

M_pi squared is (139.6)^2 ≈ let's calculate that. 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 140 - 0.4, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 → 19488.16.

m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49. Then, 2*100*5.7=1140. So, (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11,172.49.

So, M_pi squared minus m_mu squared is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide that by 2*M_pi: 2 *139.6 =279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 → approximately let's see. 279.2 * 29 is about 8096.8. 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So around 29.8 maybe.

Wait, 279.2 *29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 *30 = 8376. Subtract 279.2 *0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. That's very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is larger than 8315.67. So the actual x would be a bit less than 29.8.

So let's compute how much. 8320.16 -8315.67 =4.49. So 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016 units. So x ≈29.8 -0.016 ≈29.784. Approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for M_pi^2 and m_mu squared.

Wait, M_pi is 139.6, so M_pi squared is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that more accurately.

139.6 squared: 139 *139 = (140 -1)^2 =140^2 - 2*140*1 +1=19600-280+1=19321. Then, 0.6 is the decimal, so (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 =139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2. 139^2 was 19321. 2*139*0.6= 166.8. 0.6^2=0.36. So 19321 +166.8 =19487.8 +0.36=19488.16 MeV². That's correct.

m_mu is 105.7, so squared: 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute that more accurately.

105.7^2: 100^2 =10,000. 5.7^2 =32.49. 2*100*5.7=1,140. So (105.7)^2= 100^2 +2*100*5.7 +5.7^2=10000+1140+32.49=11172.49. Correct.

So M_pi^2 - m_mu^2 =19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Divide by 2*M_pi: 2*139.6=279.2.

So 8315.67 /279.2 ≈ let me compute that more precisely.

279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 279.2 * x =218.87 → x=218.87/279.2≈0.783.

So total x is 29 +0.783=29.783. So x≈29.78 MeV. So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Because when I said x is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (since E_nu = p), and the muon's momentum is also x but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So with p=29.78 MeV/c, and m_mu=105.7 MeV/c².

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2: approximately 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2≈0.6, and cross terms 2*29*0.78≈45. So 841 +45 +0.6=886.6. Alternatively, 29.78^2 =29^2 + 2*29*0.78 +0.78^2. 29^2=841, 2*29*0.78=45.24, 0.78^2≈0.6084. So 841 +45.24=886.24 +0.6084≈886.85 MeV².

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2=11172.49 MeV².

So E_mu = sqrt(886.85 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈109.81 MeV.

Then, E_nu = p =29.78 MeV.

So the energies are E_mu ≈109.81 MeV, E_nu≈29.78 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The kinetic energy of the neutrino is E_nu, which is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculations. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B)7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C)3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D)4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

Yes, D matches our result of approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. So D is the correct option.


To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \(M_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless. 

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = M_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p.
\]

For the muon, its total energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Substituting \(E_{\nu} = p\) and \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = M_{\pi}.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = M_{\pi} - p.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (M_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = M_{\pi}^2 - 2 M_{\pi} p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \(p^2\):
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = M_{\pi}^2 - 2 M_{\pi} p.
\]

Rearranging for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{M_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 M_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
- \(M_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

First, calculate \(M_{\pi}^2\) and \(m_{\mu}^2\):
\[
M_{\pi}^2 = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]

Then:
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Calculating Energies
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Compute \(p^2\) and \(m_{\mu}^2\):
\[
p^2 = (29.78)^2 \approx 886.85 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]

Thus:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options
The closest match to the calculated values is:
\[
K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
