Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a series of chemical reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

We need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular symmetry group.

Let's think about each step.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B, in an 8:1 ratio. What's a common reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in such a way? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something. Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sodium chloride (NaCl) and B is something else, but that doesn't seem to fit the product being red.

Wait, another possibility: If A is a metal, perhaps reacting with a halogen. Like iron (Fe) reacting with chlorine (Cl2) to form FeCl3. But wait, FeCl3 isn't bright red. Or maybe sulfur reacting with something else?

Wait, bright red product C. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like Fe(OH)3 isn't red. Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal complex. Oh, like CuSO4·5H2O is blue, but maybe something else. Oh wait, maybe C is a nickel compound? Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another angle: Reaction 3 says C reacts with water to give back A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So C → A + F + G when reacted with water.

So, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, but when it reacts with water, maybe it forms the metal hydroxide, and some acid. Wait, but if F is strong and G is weak, maybe C is an acid salt?

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na, and B is O2, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents... Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at reaction 4. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D + B → H. What solvents are formed from such reactions? Maybe H is water. But how? If D is hydrogen and B is oxygen, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is something else. If H is an alcohol, like ethanol, but that would require D and B to combine in a certain way. Alternatively, if H is something like H2O, but earlier I thought that might not fit.

Wait, maybe reaction 4 is about making a different solvent. Let me think about common solvents. Maybe H is ethanol. But how? Or maybe H is methanol. Wait, but what could form methanol? Like if B is oxygen and D is CH3OH, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is probably a salt. If it's a salt that when hydrolyzed gives two acids, maybe a salt from a diacidic acid.

Wait, suppose C is something like (NH4)2SO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NH4+ and SO4^2- ions. But then, what would F and G be? Maybe the ammonium ion would hydrolyze to give NH4OH (which is weak, but that's a weak acid?), and the sulfate might not hydrolyze under normal conditions. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitrate salt. For
