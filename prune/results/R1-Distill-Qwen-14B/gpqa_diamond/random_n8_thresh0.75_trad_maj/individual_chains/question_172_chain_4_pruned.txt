Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. They're in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, right, in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor. So the population of a certain energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The question says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So let me denote N1 as the number in star_1, N2 as in star_2. So N1 = 2 * N2.

But wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So the energy of the upper level minus the lower level is ΔE. So the ratio of populations would be based on the Boltzmann factor for this ΔE.

The ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies. But the question probably assumes that the degeneracies are the same for both stars, or that their ratio is 1. So I can ignore g for now.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ratio is for the same energy levels in each star. So each star's photosphere has their own temperature, T1 and T2. So N1 would be proportional to exp(-E_upper/(k T1)), and N2 to exp(-E_lower/(k T2))... Wait no, no, wait. Wait, each star has its own temperature. So for each star, the population of a certain level is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)) for that star's temperature.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the same energy difference applies. So for star_1, the population in the upper level is proportional to exp(-E_upper/(k T1)), and the lower level is exp(-E_lower/(k T1)), so the ratio for each star is (upper)/(lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in the problem, it's saying that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, perhaps the number of atoms in a specific energy level (let's say level 2) compared to another level (level 1) in each star. So for star_1, N1_2 / N1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, N2_2 / N2_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, maybe it's the ratio between two levels in each star. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations of the same energy level between the
