Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stellar abundances. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's. Using the EW method under LTE, they've determined some elemental abundances.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We also have the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances, but I remember that these abundance ratios are logarithmic and based on solar values.

First, I should recall what these abundance notations mean. The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of elements X to Y in the star compared to the Sun.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y to the Sun's X/Y.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 10^0 = 1.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the ratio of Si in the two stars. So, I need to find (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Alternatively, maybe express n_Si_1 in terms of H, and n_Si_2 in terms of H, then take the ratio.

Let me think about how to get n_Si for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun)

Given that for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

So in Star_1, n_Fe = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun). Wait no, because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0 → so n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is equal to that in the Sun.

So, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) ?

Wait, no, because n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So n_Fe_1 = (n
