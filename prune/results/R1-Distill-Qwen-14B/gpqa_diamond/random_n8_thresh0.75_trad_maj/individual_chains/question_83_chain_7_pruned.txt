Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with some pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when we add water, the volume increases, so the concentration should decrease. 

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). The initial volume is 0.020 L, and the concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.020 = 0.001 moles.

When we mix it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles / new volume = 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Because each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH (since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O).

So the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from before). So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001, but wait, when we diluted, I think the moles didn't change because we're just adding water. So yeah, same 0.001 moles. 

The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. 

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³. But when we're calculating 25% titration, maybe it's the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. 

But the problem is, when calculating the pH at 25% titration, the solution will have some unreacted acetic acid and some acetate ions. So I need to calculate the concentrations after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles. Let me approach it that way.

Total moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: 0.001 moles. 

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = 0.001. 

25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH. So in 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

So, when 25% of the NaOH is added, it reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. 

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So, initial moles: 0.001 CH3COOH, 0.00025 NaOH added.

Moles after reaction: CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Acetate (CH3COO^-) = 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.042
