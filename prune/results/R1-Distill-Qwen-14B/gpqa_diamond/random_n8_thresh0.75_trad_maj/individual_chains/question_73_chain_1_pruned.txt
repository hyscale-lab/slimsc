Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and calculating their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, let me read the question again. So, there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the energy, I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each and then sum them up.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. The two astronauts are moving in the same direction, right? So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because in relativity, velocities don't add that way. The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but the direction matters. Since they're both moving in the positive x-direction, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider whose frame we're calculating from? The question says 'relative speed'—I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So which astronaut's frame are we considering? Oh, the problem asks for the relative speed between them, so it's either A seeing B or B seeing A. But in relativity, the relative speed isn't symmetric. Wait, no, the formula I
