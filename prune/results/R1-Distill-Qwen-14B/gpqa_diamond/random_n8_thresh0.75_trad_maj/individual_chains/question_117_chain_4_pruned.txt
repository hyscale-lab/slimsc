Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm. Optical isomerism usually refers to stereoisomerism where the compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like enantiomers. These can arise due to chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism in certain cases.

The question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each choosing a combination.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have different conformations, but whether they exhibit optical isomerism depends on if there's a plane of symmetry. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 2', 6 and 6' on each benzene ring. Wait, biphenyls with substituents on each ring can have cis or trans orientations. But for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral, meaning no plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each benzene are in positions that make the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the structure. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, the numbering might be such that the substituents are in positions that create a chiral environment. If the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have enantiomers. So this compound might exhibit optical isomerism. I think dimethyl biphenyl dicarboxylate with nitro groups in certain positions would be chiral. So 1 probably has optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the structure where the propanoate is CH2-C(O)OCH3, but wait, it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO-. Or more accurately, propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO- but in the 2-hydroxy form, it's CH₂(OH)CH₂COO-. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCH2? No
