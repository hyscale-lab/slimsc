Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question involves several reactions, so I think I should break it down into parts, starting from compound A and moving through each reaction to find out what compound D is.

First, let me look at the information given about compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and the splitting can give clues about the structure. 

A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. For 6H as a triplet, maybe it's two equivalent sets of three H each? Wait, or perhaps it's a group where each H is adjacent to another group with two H. Like maybe a di-substituted group, like ethyl groups. Wait, wait—ethyl groups have splitting patterns when next to another CH2.

Let me think. If we have a triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm, that's often indicative of two ethyl groups attached to something. Each ethyl group has three H (CH2CH3), but wait, each CH2CH3 would split into a quartet when next to another CH2, right? Oh wait, no, the splitting depends on neighboring groups. So maybe the 6H triplet comes from two groups of three H each, like two isopropyl groups. Because an isopropyl group has (CH3)2CH. Wait, no, each isopropyl has 6 H? No, isopropyl has (CH3)2CH, which is 6 H in total for two isopropyl groups? Wait, no, wait—each isopropyl has 6 H? No, each isopropyl group has 2 CH3 groups, so 6 H in total per group. Wait, no, each CH3 has 3 H, so two CH3s would be 6 H. So maybe two isopropyl groups attached to a central carbon. But wait, the NMR shows a triplet for 6H, quartet for 4H.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. Diethyl ether, for example, has CH2CH3 groups. But the splitting... Wait, if there are two ethyl groups attached to an oxygen, like diethyl ether, then the CH2 groups would couple with each other. Let me think: the
