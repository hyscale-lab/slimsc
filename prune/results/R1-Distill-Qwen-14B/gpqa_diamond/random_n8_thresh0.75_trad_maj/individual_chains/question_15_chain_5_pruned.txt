Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on a few factors, right?

The question says Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Like how Mercury has a shorter period than Venus because it's closer to the Sun.

Also, the host stars are the same size (since their radii are same), but the star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Mass and radius being different... I think the star's mass affects the planet's orbit somehow. Like, more massive stars might have planets orbiting at different distances.

The main thing here is the probability of a transit. I remember the transit probability is roughly given by (R_star + R_planet)² over (a_planet)², but wait, actually, no. The formula I think is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit to the area where the planet can be aligned edge-on to our line of sight. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, or maybe (1/a) multiplied by some other factors. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, squared. So P ≈ (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (distance from star). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I think it's the ratio (R*/a), but squared because it's a geometric probability. So, P ∝ (R*/a)^2.

So, to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare (R* / a) for each planet.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. Another way to think about it: the probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability is higher when a is smaller because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

So the probability P is
