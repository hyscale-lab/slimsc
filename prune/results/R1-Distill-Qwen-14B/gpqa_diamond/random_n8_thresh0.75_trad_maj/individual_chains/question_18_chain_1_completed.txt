Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data includes their masses relative to the Sun and some elemental abundance ratios as determined by the Equivalent Width (EW) method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

First, let me jot down the given information.

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH= 10^-5.

Wait, what's [X/Y] notation again? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance ratio relative to the Sun.

But wait, in this case, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So if that's zero, their ratio is same as the Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0, so their Mg/H ratio is same as the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, let me think again. The notation can be a bit confusing. The subscript is the star, and the element is in the brackets. 

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is the star's Fe abundance relative to H. So when [Fe/H] is 0, it means nFe/nH = nFe/nH_sun. So Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun, because [Fe/H] is 0.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so their Mg/H ratio is same as the Sun.

But then, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3.

Hmm. So, what's the goal? The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi)_1 / (nSi)_2.

Wait, but how do I get that?

Let me think. I need to find nSi for each star relative to H, and then take the ratio.

But perhaps I can find nSi relative to H for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, no: [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So when [Fe/H] is 0, the log difference is 0, so log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun.

So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, nH is the number density of H. So to find nSi in Star_1, I can relate it to Fe and then H.

Given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

So what is (nSi/nFe)_sun? From the Sun's data, nFe/nH_sun is 10^(-4.5), as we found earlier.

Wait, but what is the Sun's nSi? I don't have that directly. Oh wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? Or not?

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], not [Si/Fe]. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Because I have nFe and nMg, but I don't have nSi. Hmm, maybe I can assume that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is a certain value, but I don't think that's given. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi? The problem doesn't give it. Hmm. So how can I proceed?

Wait, but perhaps I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero, meaning that the ratio of Si to Fe is the same as in the solar ratio. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], but only the relative abundances in the stars.

Wait, let me think again about the approach.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's make the ratio in terms of H.

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * nFe_1.

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

But nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So,

nSi_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Simplify: the nFe_sun cancels out.

nSi_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But nSi_sun /nH_sun is the Sun's abundance of Si relative to H, which would be [Si/H]_sun. But we don't have that value.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], I can't get nSi_1 in terms of H. Hmm.

Same goes for Star_2.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Si and Mg. Let me think.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.

And since [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So, from that, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2.

Then, from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3: log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Taking 10^ both sides: nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2/(10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH_2) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)) )

nSi_2 = (nH_2 * nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 * nH_sun )

Hmm, but again, we don't have nSi_sun.

Wait, but maybe we can relate the Sun's [Mg/Si] to get that.

In the Sun, we have nMg_sun and nH_sun, but what about nSi_sun?

Wait, maybe we can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

But what about [Mg/Si]_sun? Let's compute that.

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun.

Wait, no. [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = log(nX/nY)_sun - log(nX/nY)_sun =0.

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → log(nMg/nSi)_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = [Mg/Si]_sun + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun? Wait, no.

Wait, no, [X/Y]_star is log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = 0 → log(nX/nY)_sun = log(nX/nY)_sun. Which is always true, so that equation doesn't help.

But perhaps I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi)_sun - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun = 0.

Wait, that's not giving me anything new. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nSi_sun in terms of nMg_sun and the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, but I don't know the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio. Oh wait, perhaps I can compute it from the data given.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

And the Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

But what about nSi? I don't have nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to relate the [Si/Fe] ratio and [Mg/Si] ratio, but without the Sun's [Mg/Si], I can't proceed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 without knowing the absolute values, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe I can express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of the Sun's nSi, and then take the ratio, which might eliminate the need to know nSi_sun.

Let me see.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_1 / nFe_1) 

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

And (nSi_1 /nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) * (nSi_2 /nMg_2 )^{-1} 

Wait, no. Let's see.

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2/(10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )) )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Substituting,

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2 ] / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )) )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * (nMg_sun * nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 * nMg_sun )

Wait, wait, let me do that again:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH_2) / (nH_sun) ) ] / [ 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ]

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 * nMg_sun ) / (nH_sun) ) * (nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 )

The nMg_sun cancels:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

Now, I have expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_1, nH_2, and nSi_sun.

The ratio of their silicon atoms is (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

nSi_sun cancels.

= [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (1/10^0.3 ) ]

The nH_sun terms cancel.

= [nH_1 * 10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 * (1/10^0.3) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (nH_1 / nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 ) * (10^0.3 )

Because 1/(1/10^0.3) is 10^0.3.

So,

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 + 0.3) 

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^0.6 

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^0.6.

But wait, how do I find (nH_1/nH_2 )?

Hmm. I don't have the H abundance for each star. Or do I?

Wait, but in stars, the total hydrogen abundance is a function of their overall metallicity. But wait, the problem gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as 0 for each star. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → Fe/H same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → Mg/H same as Sun.

But wait, how does that affect the overall H abundance?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall metallicity. If [Fe/H]_1=0, that means [Fe/H]=0, which implies that the star's metallicity (Z) is the same as the Sun's for Fe. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, which implies Mg is same as Sun. But what about other elements?

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide other [X/H] information. Hmm. So perhaps the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun? Or is that an assumption I can make?

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, but what about the stars' [H]?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, which would make nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio (nH_1/nH_2 ) is 1.

In that case, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) would be 10^0.6 ≈ 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio would be ~4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close.

But wait, is that a valid assumption? The problem doesn't state anything about the overall H abundance of the stars. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stars' hydrogen is the same as the Sun's. Let's proceed under that assumption, since the problem doesn't give other info.

So, nH_1 =nH_sun, nH_2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 → ~4.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute 10^0.6 exactly. 10^0.6 is antilog(0.6).

We know that 10^0.6 ≈ 3.981, so about 3.98.

Which is approximately 3.9. That would be option A.

But wait, why is this the case? Because Star_1 has higher [Si/Fe], which implies more Si relative to Fe, and Star_2 has higher [Mg/Si], which implies more Mg relative to Si. But with the H abundance assumed same, the ratio ends up being 10^0.6.

Wait, but why did the masses of the stars come into play? The problem gave the masses as 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. But I didn't use them in the calculations. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the mass to determine the H abundance or something else. Let me think.

Wait, in stellar atmospheres, the surface gravity (g) is an important factor in LTE calculations. The surface gravity affects the ionization balance and thus the derived abundances. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass affects the overall metallicity, but in this problem, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given as 0, which would override any mass-based metallicity.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass relates to the star's luminosity or radius, which affects the surface gravity, but without more information, I can't see how to tie this into the problem. The problem statement says to assume LTE and use the EW method, but I think that's just setting the context for [X/Y] ratios.

So perhaps the masses are a red herring for this particular question, as the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, which directly give the H abundance relative to Fe and Mg, respectively, without needing to consider the star's mass.

So, proceeding with the assumption that nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun, the ratio of Si is ~3.98, which is option A.

Another way to check: perhaps I should compute the absolute [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, let's try that.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H] =0 → Fe/H same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So,

nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun )

But nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_1 * nH_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH_1.

nH_1 is same as Sun's nH_sun, because [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, [Fe/H]=0 means nFe/nH = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

But if nH_1 =nH_sun, then nFe_1 =nFe_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) * nFe_1 * 10^0.3

But nFe_1 =nFe_sun → nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1/nSi_sun =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun.

So,

nMg_2 =nMg_sun.

So,

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )) )

= (nMg_sun) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )) )

= (nMg_sun * nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 *nMg_sun )

= nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )

So, nSi_2 = nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ≈ nSi_sun /2.

Thus, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ) = (10^0.3 )^2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Which again gives the same result.

So the ratio is ~3.98, which is approximately option A (~3.9).


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance ratios and assume the hydrogen abundance is the same for both stars as it is for the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun's.
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: This implies that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times higher than in the Sun. Thus,  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}.
  \]

### Star_2:
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the Mg/H ratio is the same as the Sun's.
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: This implies that the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 10^(0.3) times higher than in the Sun. Thus,  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}.
  \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
To find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, we calculate:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2}.
\]

From Star_1:
\[
n_{\text{Si}}_1 = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}.
\]

From Star_2:
\[
n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{10^{0.3}}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{10^{0.3}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Numerical Value:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
