Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, let me think through this. I've studied some organometallic reactions, so I'll try to apply what I remember.

The question says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D.

First, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a Ru-based catalyst used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. The most common type, I think, is the ring-opening metathesis or cross metathesis. But wait, in this case, since it's a mono-alkene, maybe it’s a ring-closing or some sort of self-metathesis?

Wait, no. Grubbs catalyst is mainly used for olefin metathesis, which can be ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. But our starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3) something? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me write it.

Pent-
