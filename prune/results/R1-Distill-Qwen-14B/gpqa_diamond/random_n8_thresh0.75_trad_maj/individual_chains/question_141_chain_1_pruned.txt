Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene with a bromine and a deuterium? Or is it 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on benzene ring.

Wait, but benzene is a symmetric molecule, so numbering might be different. Let me think about the structure. So benzene has six positions. 1-bromo would be at position 1, and position 2 is adjacent to it. So bromine is at position 1 and deuterium at position 2.

Now, the reaction uses NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, in aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 in NH3 is a common base for deprotonating arenes, especially under certain conditions.
