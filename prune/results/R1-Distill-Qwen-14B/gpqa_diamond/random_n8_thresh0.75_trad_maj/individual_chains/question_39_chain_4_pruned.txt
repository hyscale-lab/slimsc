Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the value of 'a'. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the wave function given is ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's interesting. So the wave function is a complex number because of the 'i' term. But when we talk about the probability of finding a particle in a region, we usually look at the square of the absolute value of the wave function, which is the probability density.

So the first step is probably to calculate the probability that the particle is found between x=1 and x=3. Since when they measured, all particles were found in that interval, the probability should be 1 (or 100%).

The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute the absolute square of this. The absolute value squared is |ψ|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))² + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number like A + Bi, the absolute square is A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

The probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3. This integral should equal 1 because all the particles are found in that region.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that integral down:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln2 - ln2 is ln2.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Then, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7
