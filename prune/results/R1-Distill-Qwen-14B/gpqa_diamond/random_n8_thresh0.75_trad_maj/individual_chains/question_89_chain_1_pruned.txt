Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer for this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's go through each step and see what each product could be.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H), and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. I know that IR peaks around 1720 often indicate carbonyl groups, like ketones or maybe esters. Hmm, considering the reaction with KOH, which is a strong base, I think this is an elimination reaction, possibly dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. Heating with a strong base like KOH would likely cause an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's more than just elimination. Oh right, maybe it's a double elimination forming a ketone. Because when you have two adjacent bromides, like 1,3-dibromocyclohexane, elimination can form cyclohexene, but that's not a ketone. Wait, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent carbons. When treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, forming an allene or maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, but allene would have a C=C=C structure, which might not explain the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, another possibility is that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and when eliminated, the adjacent carbons (which are each losing a Br) would bond to each other, forming a double bond. But if it's a bridge structure, perhaps it forms a ketone via elimination. Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that requires a diol, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this
