Okay, I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, the question says it's the Ca-EDTA complex, so I think that means the concentration given is the total concentration of the complex, right? So [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M.

I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex dissociates to some extent. The formula for EDTA complex is probably CaY²- or something similar. But in any case, the key is the formation constant, K, which is given as 5x10^10. K here is the stability constant for the complex, right? So a high K means the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, the formation constant K is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. So K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}). 

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in different forms because of the pH. Oh wait, the question says the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its proper form needed for complexation. So I can assume that the concentration of EDTA is sufficient and that the pH doesn't affect the speciation much beyond what's given.

Wait, but since the solution is stoichiometric, I think it's a 1:1 complex. So one Ca²+ per EDTA. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But when the complex dissociates, it will release some Ca²+ and some EDTA. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA²-

Wait, no, the charge on EDTA when it's in the complex? Hmm. EDTA has a charge of -4 in solution, but when it complexes with Ca²+, the complex would have a charge of 0? Wait, no, because Ca²+ is +2 and EDTA^4- is -4. So CaEDTA^2- (since 2+ + 4- = 6-? Wait, no, 2+ +4- gives 2- overall charge. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the formula for the complex is CaY²−, where Y is EDTA.

So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−, and
