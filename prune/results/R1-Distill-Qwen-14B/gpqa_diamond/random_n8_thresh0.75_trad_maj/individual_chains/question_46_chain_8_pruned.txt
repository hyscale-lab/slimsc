Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually used for ring-closing or cross metathesis.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But in this case, since the molecule is a double bond with substituents, maybe it's about the geometry or something else. Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)H2-CH2? No, wait, let me draw it. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So pent has five carbons. So for 3-methyl, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, the numbering. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should count.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it out: Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. Carbon 3 is the third carbon from the left (since the double bond starts at carbon 1). So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but that would give four carbons after the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pentane has five carbons. The double bond is from C1 to C2. Carbon
