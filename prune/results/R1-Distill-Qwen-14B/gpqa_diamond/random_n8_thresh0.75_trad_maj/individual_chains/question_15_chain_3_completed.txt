Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about choosing which planet to observe based on the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability depends on several factors, right?

The problem states that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the key here is figuring out which one has a higher probability of transiting.

So the given data:

- Both planets have the same mass. So mass isn't a factor. But wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass, so maybe the actual mass could be higher, but since both are same, maybe that's not the issue here.

- Orbital periods: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3. Or wait, no—actually, if Planet_1 has a shorter period, then P1 is smaller. So for example, if P2 is 100 days, P1 would be around 33 days.

- Both have circular orbits. That probably simplifies things because eccentricity affects the probability. But since both are circular, maybe they can ignore that variable.

Host stars:

- Star_1 (Planet_1's host) has twice the mass of Star_2 (Planet_2's host). So M1 = 2 M2.

- Both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2.

Wait, but if two stars have same radius but different masses, that would mean that the more massive star is probably hotter, but maybe that's not relevant here. Or maybe relevant for the transit depth, but the question is about probability, not depth. So perhaps the radius doesn't affect the probability as much.

The question is about the probability of transit. I remember that the probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size. The formula for the probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / (a), but wait, no—that's for the depth. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the orbital distance, but wait, actually, it's more like the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Hmm, maybe the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some other factors.

Wait, I think the transit probability for a random observer is given by (R_* + R_p) / a, but wait, no—it's actually (R_* / a)^2, but that's for the area. No, wait, maybe it's more about the geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbital plane needs to be edge-on relative to us. So the probability is roughly (R*/a) * something else.

Wait, let me think again. The probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit, but that's when the planet's orbit is randomly oriented. So the probability P is (pi R_*^2) / (pi a^2) ), which simplifies to (R_* / a)^2. But wait, that's the area ratio, but probability is actually the same as that because it's the chance that the orbital plane is aligned so that we see a transit. Hmm, maybe it's (R_* + R_p) / a, but the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, so R_p is negligible. So P ≈ (R_*) / a.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by another term involving the inclination. Wait, no, the probability is (R_*/a) * (something), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's more like (R_*) / a multiplied by some factor, perhaps the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, let me recall the formula. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is given by (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)), but since e=0 here, it's (R_*/a), because R_p is much smaller than R_*, so we can ignore it. So P ≈ (R_*/a).

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) to the planet's orbital path. So for  a circular orbit, the probability is (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance. So the probability is (R_*/a).

Wait, but according to some sources, the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*)), but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. So I think that's the main factor here.

But wait, in our problem, R_* is same for both stars. So R1 = R2. So the probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with a smaller a (closer to the star) has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the semi-major axis. Since orbital period is given, we can use Kepler's third law to find a.

Kepler's third law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3)

We can write it as a proportional to (M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

Because G and 4π² are constants.

So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_* * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1, a1 = [ (M1 * (P1)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (M2 * (P2)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Given M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3.

So substituting:

a1 = [ ( 2 M2 * ( (P2/3 )^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 M2 * P2² / 9 ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

a2 is [ M2 * P2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 )

Because a1 = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3 ), a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Let me calculate that. (2/9) is approximately 0.2222. Cube root of that would be around 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

So since probability is R_* / a, and R_* is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 = (R_* / a1 ), P2 = (R_* / a2 )

So the ratio P1/P2 = ( R_* / a1 ) / ( R_* / a2 ) ) = a2 / a1

From earlier, a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3 )

So a2 / a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ cube root of 4.5. What's that? Cube of 1.6 is 4.096, so 1.6^3=4.096. 1.65^3 is about 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.72, times 1.65 ≈ 4.49. So cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65.

So a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1) ≈ 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. Wait the probability is R*/a. So since R* is same, P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

The ratio P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Which is (9/2)^(1/3 ) as I found earlier, which is approximately 1.65.

So planet 1 has a higher probability of transiting, so if the researchers want to choose the one with higher probability, they should pick Planet_1.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than what I got. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the derivation.

We have:

a ∝ (M_* * P² )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: M1=2, P1= P2/3.

So a1 = (2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 )

= (2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

M2 is M2, M1 is 2 M2, so:

a1 = [ (2/9) * (M2 P2²) ]^(1/3 )

a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * ( M2 P2² )^(1/3 )^(1/3 )

Wait, maybe I should write it as a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Because a2 is ( M2 P2² )^(1/3 ), so a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.6, as before.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

So P1 is R*/a1, P2 is R*/a2.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1/(0.6) ≈ 1.666..., which is approximately 1.67.

So option C says 1.65, which is close enough.

Alternatively, maybe using more precise calculations.

Let me compute (9/2)^(1/3) precisely. 9/2 is 4.5.

The cube root of 4.5.

I can compute it more accurately.

We know that 1.6^3=4.096.

1.65^3: Let's compute 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225.

2.7225 * 1.65 = ?

2.7225 * 1.6 = 4.356, 2.7225 * 0.05 = 0.136125. So total is 4.356 + 0.136125 = 4.492125. So 1.65^3≈4.492.

4.5 is slightly larger, so the cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65 + (4.5 - 4.492)/(3*(1.65)^2 * (0.001) )) ?

Wait, maybe an approximate way: let x=1.65, x^3=4.492125. The difference to 4.5 is 0.007875.

We can use linear approximation to find a better x.

The derivative of x^3 is 3x². So, delta_x ≈ (4.5 -4.492125)/(3*(1.65)^2) )

4.5 -4.492125=0.007875

Denominator: 3*(2.7225) = 8.1675

delta_x= 0.007875 /8.1675 ≈ 0.000963.

So x ≈1.65 + 0.000963 ≈1.650963.

So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.650963, which is about 1.651. So P1/P2≈1.651, so 1.65 times.

So the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

So according to the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A: Planet_2 is preferred, ~2.25 times higher.

Option B: Planet_2, 1.5 times.

Option C: Planet_1, 1.65 times.

Option D: Planet_1, ~2.7 times.

So the calculation leads to C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \). A smaller \( a \) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the semi-major axes for both planets:

- For Planet_1: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting, \( a_1 \propto (2M_2 \cdot (\frac{P_2}{3})^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3} \).
- For Planet_2: \( a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3} \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9}}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 orbits closer to its star than Planet_2. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this analysis, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option C** correctly states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
