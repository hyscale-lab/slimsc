Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different molecular formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits the data.

First, let me read the problem again carefully to make sure I get all the details right. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it has two substituents attached to the benzene. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption peaks in IR, usually around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch and around 1250-1450 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So that's a clue that the substituents might include an ester group, maybe something like an acyl group attached via an oxygen.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It shows six signals. Let me list them: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. Wait, no –CH2 groups are present. So all the CH2 groups are absent in the structure.

So, breaking it down:

1. Aromatic protons: two signals. A benzene ring with two substituents can cause different splitting patterns for the aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the ring might have some symmetry, leading to equivalent protons. If the substituents are para to each other, the protons on the adjacent carbons (ortho) would be equivalent, leading to a single peak. But wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm, that might suggest that the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two distinct sets. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a position that leads to two different environments for the remaining protons.

Wait, actually, with two substituents on a benzene ring, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. Let me think about the NMR signals. 

- For para substitution: the ring would have two equivalent protons (ortho to both substituents) and another two equivalent protons (meta positions), but no, wait, para substitution would actually result in two sets of equivalent protons. Let me draw this. Suppose substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then, the positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So each pair would give a singlet, but more likely, if the substituents are electron-withdrawing or donating, the neighboring protons would couple and split into doublets. Wait, but in di-substituted benzene, the number of signals depends on the symmetry. For para, the two substituents create a plane of symmetry, so the aromatic protons would split into two sets: the two ortho to one substituent (but they would be equivalent) and the two meta (also equivalent). So in the NMR, you'd see two signals for aromatic protons. So that matches the given data. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, then the ring would have less symmetry, leading to more signals. Similarly for meta, but I think para would give two signals. So perhaps the substituents are para to each other.

2. Next, the vinyl protons: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe part of a substituent attached to the benzene. For example, an ester group might have a double bond. Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R', but that doesn't have a double bond unless it's part of a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acrylate group, which has a double bond. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group.

Let me think. If
