Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, so distance d = 1/plx. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax interval. So like, if I pick a range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in that range change as the parallax changes.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their actual distances are uniformly distributed in some way. But wait, how exactly? Because if they're spread out in space uniformly, the number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the volume. 

But wait, the problem says they are uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh, wait, does that mean they're spread out uniformly in all directions, or in the sky as viewed from Earth? I think it's the latter. So maybe that the density of stars in the universe is uniform, so the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of the volume.

When you look at a certain parallax range, you're essentially looking at a shell in space. So each unit of parallax corresponds to a spherical shell of stars at a certain distance.

The number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of the shell. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance), and dr is the thickness. So for a small change in radius dr, the volume is proportional to r².

But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r. Then, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of parallax units instead of distance.

If I have a thin parallax interval from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance interval is from r = 1/plx to r = 1/(plx + dplx). Let me approximate that for small dplx. Using a Taylor expansion, r ≈ 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx^2). So the change in r, dr, is approximately dplx/(plx²). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, let's think about the volume in terms of parallax. The number of stars in a given parallax range depends on the number of stars in that shell. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.

So the volume of a shell is 4π r² dr. But dr = (d r) = (d (1/plx)) ) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, wait, that would make the volume proportional to 1/(plx^4) dplx. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let's see: dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So the shell's volume is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, that gives 4π (1/(plx)^2) * ( - 1/(plx^2) dplx ). So the volume is proportional to 1/(plx^4) dplx. But wait, the number of stars is density multiplied by volume. Since density is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/(plx^2)) dplx. That's n * (4π) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, so it's N ∝ 1/(plx^4) * dplx. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit plx changes. So, number per unit plx would be (N) / (dplx) = (n * 4π / plx^4) ) * dplx / dplx, so it's proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx+dplx is N = n * Volume.

Volume = 4π (r)^2 dr, where r is in parsecs. Since r = 1/plx, dr = derivative of r with respect to plx, which is dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So dr = - (dplx)/plx^2. But since dplx is positive when plx is decreasing, perhaps I should take the absolute value, so dr = (dplx)/plx^2.

So volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So N = n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

But the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So per dplx, it's N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would be option A.

But wait, I thought the number of stars in a shell increases with distance because the volume increases. Like, as you go further (lower plx), the number of stars in each shell increases. Hmm, but according to this, as plx decreases (distance increases), the number per unit plx actually decreases. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Wait, if plx is small, the distance is large. So a unit change in plx (like from plx to plx + dplx) would correspond to a very small change in distance, because dplx is a unit. So if plx is small, the shell is a large volume. So the number of stars in that shell would be higher, but inversely, 1/plx^4 would be smaller. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's imagine that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^2 dr. Since the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr.

If the distance is r, then plx = 1/r. So r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx^2) dplx.

So substituting into the volume, 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( - 1/(plx^2) dplx ). So the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx (since dr is negative, but we take the absolute value for the volume).

So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx. So when plx is small (large r), the number of stars in a thin plx interval is small. Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because as you go to larger distances (smaller plx), each plx interval (say, 1 unit) corresponds to a much larger volume, so more stars should be present.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think about the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. The volume of that shell is 4π r² dr, which in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx/(plx^2) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

But wait, if plx is small, like 0.01 parsecs, then 1/plx is 100 parsecs. So the volume would be 4π * (100)^2 * dr, where dr is the change in r. Wait, but in terms of plx, dr is (dplx) / (plx^2). So for plx=0.01, dr is dplx/(0.0001) = 10000 dplx. So for each 1 unit change in plx, the r changes by 10000 units. But wait, no, because plx is 0.01, dr = (dplx)/ (0.01)^2 = dplx / 0.0001. So for dplx=1, dr=10000. So the shell's volume is 4π (100)^2 * 10000 = 4π * 1e4 * 1e4 = 4π * 1e8. Which is a huge volume.

So the number of stars in that shell should be proportional to the volume, which is 1e8. That seems correct, but according to the earlier calculation, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would be 1e-8 for plx=0.01. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Let me re-examine the substitution.

r = 1/plx.

So dr = - (1 / plx^2) dplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But dplx is positive, so take absolute value: 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

So as plx decreases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit plx decreases. That seems incorrect because as you look further away, each unit of plx should encompass more stars. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the axes.

Wait, let's think about the number of stars in a shell for a given plx interval. Let's say we have a small change in plx, dplx. The corresponding change in distance is dr = (dplx)/(plx^2). So the volume is 4π r^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2 ) = 4π (dplx) / (plx^4).

So for a fixed dplx, as plx decreases (we look further away), the volume increases, so the number of stars increases. So for the same dplx, when plx is smaller, more stars are in that interval.

But according to N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4, when plx is small, N/dplx is small, which would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is small. But that doesn't fit with the idea that further away (smaller plx) have more stars in each plx interval.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let's think in terms of how the number of stars in a given parallax interval (say, from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx.

Wait, for a given dplx, say dplx = 1, as plx decreases, the number of stars in that interval increases. Because the shell at lower plx (higher r) has a larger volume.

But according to N = 4π n (dplx) / plx^4, when plx is small, N is larger. So N increases as plx decreases. But the question is about the number per unit parallax, which is N/dplx. So for each unit plx, the count is N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4. So as plx decreases (distance increases), the count per unit plx decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting with the intuition.

Wait, perhaps I should plot this. Suppose plx=1, then N/dplx = 1/(1)^4 = 1. Plx=0.5, N/dplx =1/(0.5)^4= 16. Plx=0.1, N/dplx=1/(0.1)^4=10,000. So the count per unit plx increases as plx decreases. Oh wait, wait no, 1/(0.1)^4 is 1e4, which is larger than 1e0, so yes, as plx decreases, the number per unit plx increases.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation, N = (4π n) * (dplx) / plx^4. So N = (4π n) * dplx * plx^-4.

So N is proportional to plx^-4. So for a fixed dplx, as plx decreases, N increases. That makes sense because more volume, more stars in that plx interval.

So the number of stars in a fixed dplx interval (like each 1 unit of plx) is higher when plx is smaller. So the number per unit plx is higher when plx is smaller.

Wait, but the question is how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So the function is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx increases as 1/plx^4 as plx decreases.

Wait, but that's a bit counterintuitive because looking at larger distances (smaller plx) would give more stars in each plx interval. So the answer would be ~ 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But let me think again. Because the volume of each shell is increasing as 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and the volume of spherical shells at different distances. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the density of stars and the volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi r^2 dr
\]

Since \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \):

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right)
\]

Taking the absolute value for simplicity:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars in the shell is proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform density of stars. Thus:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is \( \frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \). Substituting \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \):

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
