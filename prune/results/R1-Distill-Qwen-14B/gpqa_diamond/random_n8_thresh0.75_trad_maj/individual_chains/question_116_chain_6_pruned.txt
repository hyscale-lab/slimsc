Okay, I've got this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because NMR can get tricky. Let me start breaking it down step by step.

So, the question is about Compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet implies each is next to three others.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. Hmm, 6 hydrogens could be from something like two methyl groups (each with 3H). Wait, but 6H would be two sets of three? Or maybe one large set. Wait, 6H is probably two equivalent CH3 groups. Because if it's a triplet, maybe they're adjacent to something with two protons each. Like if each CH3 is next to a CH2.

Wait, so for a triplet at 0.9 ppm, that's a common region for CH3 groups, especially in an isopropyl group or something similar. But let me think. If there's a triplet, each proton in the triplet is adjacent to two others. Wait, no, the splitting is due to adjacent protons. So for a triplet, the proton is next to a CH2 group. Because a CH2 would split into a triplet when next to another CH2.

Wait, maybe I should consider the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm has 6H. So maybe two sets of CH3 groups that are each adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted group. Alternatively, maybe it's a single CH3 group that's split into a triplet for some reason.

Wait, but 6H is a lot. Let me think of possible structures. If I have a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2..., but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's two methyl groups attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is (CH3)C-CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of
