Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, that means it's not normalized yet. So first, I think I need to normalize the state. Because in quantum mechanics, states have to be normalized, right? So the probability of each state will depend on the square of the coefficients.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. Oh right, the operator given has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So what's the matrix for that operator?

Let me think. The spin states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of S_z, the z-component of spin. But the operator we're dealing with here isn't S_z. The matrix A has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it's a 2x2 matrix, right? So for a two-level system, it's:
[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Wait, that's an off-diagonal matrix. That looks familiar; that's the form of the Pauli X matrix multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A must be (hbar/2) times X. Because A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are not |up> and |down>. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are the spin states in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, because A is proportional to σ_x.

So the question is, when we measure the operator A, we're measuring in the basis of its eigenstates. But wait, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis, which are the eigenstates of S_z, not A. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, or find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, another approach: since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, any measurement in the σ_x basis. So the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(
