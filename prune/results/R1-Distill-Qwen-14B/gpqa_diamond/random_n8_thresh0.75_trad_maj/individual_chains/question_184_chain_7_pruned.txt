Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me the desired product: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think this through step by step.

First, let me draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are important. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene rings can be numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think: the structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

So, three substituents: ethoxy (-OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2), each in the meta positions relative to each other as much as possible, I suppose.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. Benzene can undergo various electrophilic substitutions. Let me think about the order of introducing substituents because the order could affect where the groups end up.

The substituents are: tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro. Let me think about their directing effects.

- tert-Butyl is a bulky substituent. It's an activating group because it's an alkyl group. But bulky groups can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. tert-Butyl is a strong activating group, but being bulky, it's a meta director because the para position might be more hindered.

Wait, no. Wait, alkyl groups are activating, ortho/para directors. But bulky groups like tert-butyl can be such that the para position is more hindered, so maybe they're more likely to direct to the meta? Or maybe they are para directors but with steric hindrance. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe in some cases, the para position is not easily accessible, so the substituents end up in the ortho or meta positions.

Wait, I think for tert-butyl, it's an activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's ortho/para directing. But due to its size, para might be difficult, so maybe the incoming electrophile tends to attack in the ortho position more than para? Or maybe it's still para favored, but with steric issues.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The tert-butyl group is an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. However, because of its size, the para position may be less accessible. So, perhaps the major product would be the ortho substitution, but sometimes para. But in some cases, the para might be the major product if possible.

The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

The challenge here is to arrange the substituents correctly. Let me consider the order of introducing the groups. Because each substitution affects where the next group goes.

I think the key is to consider the directing effects and the order of introducing the substituents.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Benzene has no substituents.

2. First substitution: Let's say we add the tert-butyl group. To do that, we can use tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). So, the first step is adding the tert-butyl.

3. Next, perhaps we add the ethoxy group. But where? If the first substituent is tert-butyl, which is an activating, ortho/para director, the ethoxy group would add either ortho or para to it. Wait, but the target molecule has the ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Let me visualize this. So, positions 1, 2, 3. So, substituents are adjacent, but that's not possible for ortho or para. Wait, maybe the positions are 1, 2, and 3 on the ring. So, let's see:

If I have benzene. First, add tert-butyl at position 2 (since the target is 2-tert-butyl). Hmm, but when you first add a substituent, you can't target a specific position; the substituent can go into any position, but with the directing effects, it's either ortho, meta, or para relative to the existing substituent.

Wait, but when you add the first substituent, it's just added somewhere on the ring. So, perhaps the order of adding substituents affects where the next will go.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is
