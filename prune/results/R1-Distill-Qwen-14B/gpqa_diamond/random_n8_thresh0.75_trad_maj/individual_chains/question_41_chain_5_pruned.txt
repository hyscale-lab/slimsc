Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different media. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed. But wait, c is given as 1 here, so the speed inside the glass when it's stationary is 1/n.

But the glass is moving, so how does that affect the speed? I think this has to do with relative motion. When the medium is moving, does it add to the speed of the light as observed?

I've heard about the concept where the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but when it's in a medium, it's slower. But when the medium itself is moving, does it change the observed speed?

Wait, another thought: the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but that's the speed relative to the medium. So if the medium (the glass) is moving at velocity v, then from the lab frame, the speed of light should be the speed of the medium plus the speed of light in the medium, but wait, not exactly. Because velocities don't just add up like that when they're in different reference frames, especially when dealing with relativity.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. So, the glass
