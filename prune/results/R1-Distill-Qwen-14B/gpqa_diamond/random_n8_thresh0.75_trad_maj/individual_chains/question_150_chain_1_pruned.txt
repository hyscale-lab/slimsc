Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on here. Alright, the question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO reacting through a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is based on the NMR data and the reaction steps.

First, let's start by looking at the NMR data because that will give me some structural clues. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me break these down.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So this suggests that the compound has an aldehyde group (-CHO).

Next, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm. Those look like aromatic protons. The splitting suggests coupling between adjacent protons on the benzene rings. The 6.98 could be para-substituted aromatic protons, maybe ortho to another substituent. The 6.51 might be a similar situation. Alternatively, they could be part of a para-substituted ring with substituents causing the doublet.

Then, the broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchangeable proton, like an -OH group, but wait, 2H? Or perhaps it's a pair of protons that are not split because they're adjacent and maybe part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an enol or something like that. Wait, another thought: if there are two protons that are deshielded but not split by much, maybe they're part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen. Like an -O-CH2-CH2-O- structure? Or maybe a conjugated diene? Hmm, not sure yet.

The doublet at 3.66 ppm for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe something like OCH2CH2... or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester, but given the other data, perhaps an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something with an aldehyde group and some aromatic substituents. Considering the molecular formula is C8H9NO, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here, and N is 1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be five rings or double bonds. Hmm, possible structures include benzene rings and double bonds.

Wait, having an aldehyde and benzene rings. Let me think. One benzene ring would account for 4 degrees (3 double bonds in the ring + one for each substituent). But wait, a benzene ring is three double bonds, so each ring adds 4 degrees of unsaturation (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds, so 6-6 + 3*2 = 3*2=6? Wait, maybe I'm mixing the formula. Wait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is: each ring or double bond is one degree, each triple bond is two, etc. So benzene has three double bonds, so three degrees of unsaturation. Each ring adds one more? No, wait: a benzene ring has three double bonds and is a cyclic structure, so the ring itself is a degree. So each benzene ring contributes 4 degrees: 3 for the double bonds, 1 for the ring. So, two benzene rings would account for 8, but that's more than our total. Wait, our total is 5.

Wait, C8H9NO has 5 degrees. Let's see, if there's a benzene ring (4 degrees), and then perhaps a double bond (another degree), that's five. So the structure could have a benzene ring and maybe an aldehyde and a double bond somewhere else.

Looking at the NMR again. The aldehyde is at 9.72. Then, the aromatic protons might come from a substituted benzene ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be two sets of protons on the benzene, perhaps para-substituted. Let me imagine a para-substituted benzene with another group attached.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2... Wait, but then where? Alternatively, it could be part of an enol structure. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The 6.27 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an enol proton. Enols typically show up around 5-7 ppm, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but no, that's already accounted for. Or maybe it's an -OH group, but 2H as OH? Un
