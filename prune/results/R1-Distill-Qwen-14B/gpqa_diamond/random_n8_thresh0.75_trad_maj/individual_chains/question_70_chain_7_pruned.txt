Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Alright, let's break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So the reaction might be something like A + 8B → C.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe the reaction is C + 2D → E.

Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

Another part: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H.

I need to figure out what these compounds might be. Let's think of possible candidates.

Looking at the first reaction, A reacting with B to make a red product C. I remember that sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water to form H2SO4 and H2SO3, but that might not fit. Wait, maybe A is something like sodium sulfate or another salt. Another thought: The bright red product C could be something like Iodine (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is something like chlorine gas.

Wait, when solid A reacts with gas B (maybe Cl2) in a 1:8 ratio, and forms a red product. I'm thinking of something like the formation of a chloro compound. Let me think: Maybe A is sodium sulfide (Na2S) and B is Cl2. But 8 Cl2 per Na2S? That seems high. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeS and B is Cl2. FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 and S? But that gives S as a product, which is yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another idea. When copper reacts with chlorine, it forms CuCl2, but that's blue. Hmm.
