Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. And since the photospheres are in LTE, I remember that this means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies, so Boltzmann distribution should hold.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution... right. The population of energy levels in a gas is given by the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). So the formula is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh, so I think that means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me get this right. Let's denote the ratio as N_upper/N_lower.

So for star_1: N1 = 2 * (N2 of star_2). Wait, no, wait. No, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1. So star_1 has a higher ratio of excited to unexcited atoms.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as r1 and star_2 as r2. So r1 = 2 * r2? Or wait, the wording is that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe r1 = 2 * r2. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me clarify: if in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited, so the ratio is higher. So, for example, if star_2 has a ratio of N_upper/N_lower = x, then star_1 would have 2x.

Wait, no, perhaps it's that the number in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So if in star_1, the excited state has N1_upper, and in star_2 it's N2_upper, then N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited level to the ground level that is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So r1 = 2 * r2.

But let's get back to the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by:

r = N_upper / N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, wait, ΔE is the energy difference from the lower to the upper level, so yes, the exponential is negative.

So for each star, we can write:

r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, r1 = 2 * r2. Or wait, no, because the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as that in star_2. So maybe r1 = 2 * r2.

Wait, no, no. Let me read the question again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number in the excited state is higher. So the ratio r1 = N1_upper / N1_lower, and r2 = N2_upper / N2_lower. So r1 = 2 * r2.

Wait, that can't be, because if r1 is higher, that implies that star_1 has a higher excitation, which would suggest higher temperature. Because higher temperature means more atoms are in higher energy states.

So, if r1 = 2 * r2, then we can set up the equations.

So let's write that down:

r1 = 2 r2.

But r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So substituting:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but let's think about what's given. The energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's interesting because 1.38 is approximately k (Boltzmann constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * T, where T is something... Oh wait, no, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k * T would imply T=1 K. But that's probably a coincidence, but perhaps the numbers are chosen that way.

But regardless, let's proceed with the equation.

So from the equation:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, no: wait, the equation is:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Wait, because:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

So ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But let's rearrange the terms:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So substituting that in:

(ΔE/k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Now, the question is about the effective temperatures T1 and T2. The options are equations involving ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2.

Let's see if we can solve for this expression.

We can write:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) ]

But wait, what's ΔE/(k)? Since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T for some T? Wait, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T => T = ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting ΔE/(k) = 1 K into the equation:

ln(2) = ( 1 K ) * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

So that's the equation we get. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D says ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes. So that's the correct equation. So the answer is D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to unexcited atoms are:

\[
r_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad r_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2, so:

\[
r_1 = 2 r_2
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(r_1\) and \(r_2\):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring the terms involving \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

The Boltzmann constant \(k\) is approximately \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), and the energy difference \(\Delta E\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
