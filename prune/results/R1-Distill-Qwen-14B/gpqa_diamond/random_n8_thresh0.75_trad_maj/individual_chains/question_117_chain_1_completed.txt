Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with chiral centers and whether a molecule can rotate plane-polarized light. Let me think through each of the options given.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are 1 to 4, and the possible answers are combinations of these.

First, let me understand what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning that the compound is not superimposable on its mirror image. This leads to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, and these can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

So, I need to check each of the four compounds to see if they have any chiral centers or other sources of asymmetry that would cause optical isomerism.

Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Wait, that's a mouthful. So, it's a biphenyl structure; two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' with nitro groups, and at positions 2 and 2' with carboxylate groups (since it's the dicarboxylate, each is esterified with a methyl group).

Now, the question is: does this molecule have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral? Biphenyls can have axial chirality, but that's more about the arrangement around the single bond connecting the two rings. Wait, axial chirality requires that the substituents on either side are different, and that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. The main chain is a biphenyl; each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. But wait, the substituents on each ring are the same. So on each ring, you have a nitro and a carboxylate. Are the substituents on the two rings in such a way that the molecule as a whole is chiral?

Wait, the biphenyl group: when each ring has two substituents in a symmetrical fashion, like 2 and 6, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry, then it could have axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center. Let me think. Do any of the ester oxygens have four different substituents? The ester groups are OMe, attached to the carbonyl. Wait, the ester groups are at positions 2 and 2', meaning each is attached to the carbon next to the biphenyl? Hmm, maybe the central carbon (the one attached to the oxygen in the ester) is a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6, and a carboxylate at 2. The ester groups are OMe attached to the carbons in position 2 of each ring. So each ester group is on a benzene ring at the 2 position.

Wait, wait, in a benzene ring, the substituents are in specific positions. The biphenyl is 1,1'-biphenyl, meaning the two benzene rings are connected at their 1 positions.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2.

But wait, the positions on a benzene ring are relative. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So for each ring, the nitro and the carboxylate are across from each other.

Wait, so each benzene ring would have a nitro group in position 6 and a carboxylate in position 2. Since benzene is symmetrical, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each ring. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So the rings themselves might be symmetric.

But then the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'. So the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are on each ring but across from each other.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. If each ring has the same substituents, and the arrangement is such that there's a plane of symmetry, then the molecule wouldn't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me think: if the substituents are arranged in a way that flipping the molecule would result in the same structure. If the substituents are mirror images, then no chiral centers.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, do the ester groups cause any chiral centers?

The ester groups are OMe attached to the carbonyl. Wait, the ester is OMe, so the structure is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so in this case, each ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl, which is connected to the benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is connected to a carbon that's attached to the benzene. So for each ester, the structure is OMe-O-CO-(C6H4-...). Wait, no. The actual structure is a biphenyl, with each benzene having a carbonyl group connected to a methyl ester.

Wait, perhaps the carbon where the ester is attached is a chiral center. Let me think: the ester group is OMe attached to a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. So the carbonyl is attached to that carbon.

Wait, in the structure, each ring has a carbonyl group: O=C-OCH3. So the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is part of the ring, so it's not a chiral center. Because the ring is sp2 hybridized, so the carbons are trigonal planar.

Wait, so the carbonyl is attached directly to the benzene. So that carbon is part of the ring, meaning it's not a chiral center. Therefore, the ester groups themselves don't introduce any chiral centers.

Hmm, then does the biphenyl have a center of asymmetry? Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents on either end are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. For axial chirality, the substituents on each ring should be different and not arranged symmetrically.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. So on each ring, the substituents are the same. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 (opposite each other), and the same on the other ring. So the arrangement of substituents on each ring is symmetric.

Wait, but the two rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents could be arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is not symmetric. For example, if the substituents on one ring are arranged in a certain way relative to the substituents on the other ring.

Wait, maybe the two substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images. So, perhaps they create a plane of symmetry through the central bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetric. If substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach. Does the molecule have any chiral centers? If not, and if it's flat, then maybe no. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, the molecule might not have any chiral centers but could have a different type of isomerism, like geometric isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which relates to chirality.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at 6 and 2, respectively. So perhaps each ring is symmetric. The two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are aligned in a symmetric fashion.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, but since each is on a different ring, maybe it's symmetric.

I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Let's see. The structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but more accurately, it's CH3CH2COOH. Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the correct formula is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the central carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, wait: the propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 group. So it would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

But wait, that would make it (CH2OH)CH2COOH, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, correct. So the ester would be methyl ester, so OMe instead of OH on the acid.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look at the carbon with the hydroxyl group. The carbon chain is: COOCH3 is on the third carbon, so the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: COOH

Wait, but 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2, which is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of propanoic acid as:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, that's not right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, yes. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-COOH.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH.

Then, the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the carbon in the middle (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

and another CH(OH) ?

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),

and another CH group? Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon (carbon 2) would have two CH2 groups attached? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH(OH), and carbon 3: COOCH3.

So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- an OH group,

and another group, which would be hydrogen perhaps. Wait, no, because in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),

- COOCH3 (carbon 3),

- OH,

and a hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be because CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 would have the structure where the central carbon is CH(OH), which is connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So, four different groups attached to the central carbon: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.

So that's a chiral center! So the molecule has a chiral center, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism. So 2 has optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone.

Benzophenone is a ketone with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. Its structure is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. So, the structure is Ph-CO-Ph.

Does this molecule have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen (C=O). So it's a carbonyl group, and the carbon is sp2 hybridized, so it's trigonal planar, not a chiral center. Also, the two phenyl groups are attached symmetrically to the carbonyl carbon. So the molecule is symmetrical, thus it's achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is an acid; the dimethyl ester would be the diester. Fumaric acid is a di-carboxylic acid with two double bonds, I think. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. No, wait: maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me recall: maleic acid is the cis isomer (two COOH groups on the same side), and fumaric acid is the trans isomer (opposite sides).

Wait, but wait: maleic acid is the cis dihydroxy form, and fumaric is the trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=O
     /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, wait. The structure of fumarate would have two double bonds in the trans configuration. So, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3? No, wait. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So when esterified, it becomes CH2CHCOOCH3 but in the trans form.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a substituted maleate. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration.

Wait, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, for optical isomerism, can this molecule have any?

Wait, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. So, if the substituents around the double bond are different, it can have geometric isomerism. But optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center or an axial chirality.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on the double bond are two ester groups (OCH3COO-) on each end. Wait, no, wait. Each ester group is OCH3 attached to a carbonyl group. So on each end of the double bond, you have a carbonyl group connected to OCH3.

Wait, so each end is the same. So the structure is (Z)- or (E)-, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait: if both ends are the same, then the double bond can't have geometric isomerism. Because geometric isomerism requires two different groups on each carbon of the double bond.

Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on each end are both the same (each is a carbonyl-OCH3 group). So, if both ends are identical, then there's no geometric isomerism. But wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, for a double bond to have geometric isomerism, each carbon in the double bond must be connected to two different groups. So, in this case, each carbon in the double bond has a carbonyl group (which is connected to OCH3) and another substituent.

Wait, actually, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, fumarate is an acid, so the structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The ester would be OCH3 in place of the OH groups.

So, the structure would be OCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, fumarate is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So as the dimethyl ester, it would be OMeO2C-CH=CH-CO2OMe.

Wait, that makes the structure OMe-O-C-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-C-O-Me. No, wait. Each COOH group becomes a COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)-CO2Me. Wait, no, wait. The actual structure is OMe-O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O-C-O-Me? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. So the structure is OCH2C=CHCO2Me, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then there's no optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same (each is a methyl ester group). So if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on each end are different. Wait, no, because both ends are COOCH3 groups. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents on each end are the same.

Wait, but wait: if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, so it can't be chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, no, wait, wait. Because the double bond could have a certain configuration that leads to axial chirality.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if both ends are same, then it's symmetrical.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the substituents on each end of the double bond are same, then the molecule can't have geometric isomerism, but could it have optical isomerism if it has a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-OMe? No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups are on the same side, leading to a certain configuration.

Wait, maybe the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each connected to two ester groups, which might make them not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule being a meso compound. If a molecule has multiple chiral centers but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has a double bond with substituents arranged in a way that leads to axial chirality, like in allene structures or certain double bonds with bulky substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is the cis dihydroxy form, and fumaric is the trans. So when esterified, would that affect the configuration?

Wait, but regardless of that, the question is whether the compound can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a lack of symmetry and a chiral element.

In dimethyl fumarate, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me imagine the structure: the two ester groups (OCH3) are on each end of a double bond. So, if the substituents on each end are the same (each is OCH3), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the middle of the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I'm pretty sure that fumarate has a certain configuration. Let me recall: in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is E-configured. Does that make it chiral?

Wait, a molecule with a double bond in the trans configuration can sometimes be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, in the case of allenes, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end has the same substituent (OCH3COO). So even if the substituents are on opposite sides, if they're the same, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end is a methyl ester group attached to a carbonyl. So, if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, the molecule would not be chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Because I remember that some diesters can be chiral. For example, tartaric acid derivatives can have optical isomerism. But in the case where both substituents are same, like in fumarate, it's a different situation.

Wait, another approach: look at the number of stereogenic elements. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality, like axial chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the only stereogenic element is the double bond's configuration. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule can't have optical isomerism because flipping the molecule would lead to the same structure. So, no.

Wait, but wait. For example, in the case of 2-pentene, if both ends have same groups, like CH3-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3, then it's symmetrical and not chiral. But in fumarate, each end has same groups (OCH3COO), so the molecule is symmetrical.

So, no optical isomerism in 4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer. In the diester form, would that configuration lead to chirality? I'm pretty sure that it doesn't, because each end is identical.

So, putting it all together.

Now, the options:

1. I'm not sure, but I thought it might be symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

2. Yes, has a chiral center, so optical isomerism.

3. No, symmetric, so no.

4. No, symmetric.

Wait, but let me re-examine number four. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, the structure is OMe-O-C-O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O-C-O-Me? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is OMe-O-C-O-C double bond.

Wait, maybe the carbons adjacent to the ester groups are chiral centers.

Wait, the structure is OCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is OCH2-C=C-OCH3. No, that's not correct either.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a cyclopropane ring? No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-OMe? No, that can't be right because fumarate is a diacid.

So, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the diester would be OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-OMe.

So, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-OMe? No, because it's a double bond between the two central carbons.

So, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-OMe? No, wait, no, it's OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-OMe.

In this structure, each CH=CH has two substituents: a COOCH3 group and a H? No, because each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group? No, wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=CH
     /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each end is a COOCH3 group, and the two CH groups in the middle form the double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C = C - O-C-OCH3
                ||
                O

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, it's:

O               O
||             ||
O-C-OCH3 - C - C - O-C-OCH3
    \         /
     C = C

No, that's not right. Let me think: fumarate is the trans dihydroxy form of maleic acid. So when esterified, the substituents would be on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would have a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but since they're identical, the molecule would still have a plane of symmetry.

Hmm, okay, maybe I should conclude that 4 does not have optical isomerism.

So, summarizing:

1. No, because symmetric.

2. Yes, has chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

But wait, let me re-examine number 1. I'm not sure about it.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, it's a biphenyl with nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at 6 and 2, respectively.

Wait, each ring's substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So, each ring has substituents opposite each other.

Now, the biphenyl is connected at the 1 and 1' positions.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are in a symmetric position for each ring.

But when connected, would the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the central bond, making it achiral.

But if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring lead to a chiral arrangement. For example, if the substituents are in such positions that the two rings are mirror images of each other, making the entire molecule a meso compound.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the point where the two rings are connected.

Wait, no, because the central bond is a single bond connecting the two rings, and the substituents are in the 1,1' positions, which are symmetric.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a case of biphenyl with substituents leading to axial chirality. For axial chirality, substituents on each ring must be different and arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

But in this case, each ring has same substituents (nitro and carboxylate at 2 and 6), so perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

So, I think 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

Wait, but if only 2 is correct, then the options don't have an option with only 2. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Hmm, the question is which of the four show optical isomerism. So, if only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2. Wait, but the options given are A to D, and I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, let me reevaluate option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, then the molecule could have geometric isomerism, but not necessarily optical isomerism. However, if the molecule has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-COO-O-Me? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-Me, but that's a single bond. No, wait, fumarate is a diacid with a double bond.

So, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-Me? No, that's not correct. It should be OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-Me.

Ah, but in that case, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral.

Wait, but what if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical? For example, if the substituents on the double bond are in a configuration that leads to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, but if the substituents are same on both ends, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral.

Therefore, I think option 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Wait, the options are:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option B:3,4

Option C:2 and3

Option D:1 and2

Wait, so if only 2 is correct, but none of the options include only 2, then perhaps I made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure of fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The diester would be (E)-MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Now, looking at this structure, each end has a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 is correct.

But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. The options are A to D, and the choices include various combinations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1.

Let me try to reevaluate option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 6' (nitro groups) and 2 and 2' (carboxylate groups).

Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. So, each ring is symmetric.

But when connected, does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents leads to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Hmm, perhaps the biphenyl group is such that the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides. For example, if one ring has substituents in the ortho positions relative to the connecting bond, and the other ring's substituents are in meta positions, but in this case, each substituent is in the para position relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, in the biphenyl group, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Since the connecting bond is at position 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting position.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are in positions that are not mirror images across the central bond, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

I'm not entirely certain, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each ring, the molecule would be achiral.

So, perhaps option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then only option 2 is correct. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism. How?

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3 groups). Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. But in this case, there are no chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I should look for more information. I remember that fumarate itself is a diacid which is the trans isomer, but when esterified, it becomes a diester. The diester would have two identical groups on each end of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure. Therefore, the diester is achiral.

So, only option 2 is correct.

But looking back at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again about option 4. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure of fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so in the diester form, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since both substituents are same (OCH3), the molecule is still symmetrical.

So, no, I think 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps the initial analysis of option 1 is incorrect. Let me think about the substituents again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring.

In each ring, nitro is at position 6 (which is opposite to position 2), and carboxylate is at position 2.

So, each ring has substituents across from each other. So, the substituents on each ring are opposite, making each ring symmetrical.

But when connected to another ring, do the substituents cause the entire molecule to lack symmetry?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric because the substituents on each ring are opposite and aligned in a way that the entire molecule has a mirror plane.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. So, it's symmetrical and not chiral.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Thus, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options provided don't include an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism because it's a trans diester with substituents that make it chiral.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end is same, so the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, to summarize:

Only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake in evaluation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester. Could the trans configuration make it chiral?

Wait, no, because the substituents on each end are same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

Hmm, perhaps option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, option 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 6 and 6' (nitro) and 2 and 2' (carboxylate).

Wait, in the biphenyl, each ring has two substituents: nitro and carboxylate. These substituents are in positions that are opposite each other on each ring.

But when connected, perhaps the substituents lead to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, another approach: the molecule's symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. If the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it is chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are opposite. So, the molecule as a whole may have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

I'm not entirely sure. But if the substituents are in positions that are not symmetrical, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult. But I think in the case of 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

So, perhaps option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is 2.

But looking at the options, it's not present. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, but each ester group is on the same side. Wait, no, because fumarate is the trans isomer, so the substituents are opposite.

Thus, each ester group is on opposite sides, but because they're the same, the molecule is symmetrical.

Therefore, no optical isomerism in 4.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine option 4 again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-OMe.

Wait, the central carbons in the double bond are each connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to two different groups. For example, each carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group or something else. If that's the case, then each carbon in the double bond would have two different substituents, making it a possible site for chirality.

Wait, no. For a double bond, each carbon is connected to two groups. For example, if each carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group, then each carbon would have two substituents: COOCH3 and CH2.

Wait, but in that case, each carbon would have two substituents, so the molecule could have axial chirality.

Hmm, perhaps in this case, the double bond has two different substituents on each end, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group? No, COOCH3 is a substituent.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to two different groups, leading to possible axial chirality.

Wait, for axial chirality, the two substituents on each end of the double bond must be different.

In this case, each end has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, if the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule could have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Each end of the double bond in fumarate would have a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to COOCH3 and CH2.

Wait, perhaps each end is the same, so the molecule is symmetrical. So, no axial chirality.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about the options given.

The correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me re-examine each compound.

1. Does it have any chiral centers or axial chirality?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But since each ring has nitro and carboxylate in positions 2 and 6, which are opposite, and the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

So, 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only 2 is correct, but there's no option for that.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides. So, it's a trans diester. If the substituents on each end are same but on opposite sides, the molecule is not chiral.

Wait, but axial chirality requires that the substituents on each end are different. So, if each end is same, then no axial chirality.

Therefore, option 4 is not chiral.

So, the only correct option is 2. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 1,2,4.

But I'm not sure about 1 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the substituents in option 1 create a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think about the ester groups.

Each ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl. The carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is part of the ring, so it's sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.

So, no chiral centers there.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group creates a chiral center. But the nitro group is a meta director and doesn't contribute to chirality.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach. Which of the options are known for optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (option 2) is known as a compound that can have a chiral center, so it's correct.

Dimethyl fumarate (option 4) is used as a plasticizer and is known for its ability to induce polymerization, but I'm not sure about its optical activity. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diastereomer.

Wait, but without knowing, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the question again.

The question asks which of the four organic moieties show optical isomerism.

So, the correct options are:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Only 2 is correct. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-OMe.

Wait, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, so each carbon is connected to two different groups: COOCH3 and CH2. Therefore, each carbon is a chiral center if it's a tetrahedral geometry.

Wait, but in a double bond, the carbons are sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. So, no.

So, no optical isomerism in 4.

Thus, the only correct option is 2.

But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4 and it does have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a chiral center.

But I don't see any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A:1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option A is correct because 1 is a biphenyl with substituents leading to axial chirality.

Wait, perhaps in option 1, the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry, making the biphenyl chiral.

In that case, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if 1,2,4 are correct, then option A is correct.

But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But given that, I'll proceed to conclude.


To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and contains a chiral center or exhibits axial chirality.

### **Analysis of Each Compound**

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring. Each ring has substituents at positions that are opposite (para) to each other, and the molecule as a whole appears to have a plane of symmetry through the central bond connecting the two rings. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the central carbon) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule therefore exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen (C=O) and is sp2 hybridized, meaning it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric due to the identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure OMe-O-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-OMe. The double bond in fumarate is in the trans configuration, but the substituents on each end of the double bond are identical (COOCH3 groups). This symmetry ensures that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: No optical isomerism (symmetric biphenyl structure).  
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center at position 2).  
- **Compound 3**: No optical isomerism (symmetric molecule).  
- **Compound 4**: No optical isomerism (symmetric diester structure).  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **Compound 2**. However, none of the provided options include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the evaluation of Compound 1 or 4.
