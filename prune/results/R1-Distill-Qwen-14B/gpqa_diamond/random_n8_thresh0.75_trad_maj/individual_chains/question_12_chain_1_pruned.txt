Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when particles decay, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the situation is a bit simpler because the initial momentum is zero.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. The pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are super light, almost massless, right? So I guess the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others. But wait, the problem says the products are mu(+) and nu, so maybe the neutrino is considered massless, or perhaps it's a neutrino with some mass. But since the problem doesn't give a mass for the neutrino, I think we'll assume it's massless.

So, the decay equation is π+ → μ+ + ν. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is almost zero, its kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), but since m≈0, that's problematic. Wait, no, neutrinos have kinetic energy based on their momentum. Hmm, perhaps I should model this using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me outline the knowns:
- Rest mass of π (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Rest mass of muon (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Neutrino mass (m_nu) ≈ 0, so we'll treat it as zero for calculation.

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi * c². Since the pion is at rest, E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have kinetic energy plus its rest energy, and the neutrino will have energy equal to its kinetic energy (since its rest energy is zero).

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2 ) 
E_nu = p_nu * c.

But since the pion is at rest, momentum must be conserved. The total momentum after decay is p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_nu = -p_mu. The magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So E_nu = p c.

Now, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So, the total energy after decay is:

E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c²

So substituting,

sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c = m_pi c²

I can divide both sides by c² to make it easier,

sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p = m_pi.

Let me write x = p. Then,

sqrt( x² + m_mu² ) + x = m_pi.

Subtracting x from both sides,

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x.

Squaring both sides,

x² + m_mu² = (m_pi - x)^2.

Expanding the right side,

x² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides,

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x.

Rearranging,

2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

x = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi )

Wait, let me compute that.

Plugging in the numbers:

m_pi = 13
