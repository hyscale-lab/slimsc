Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the usual laws of thermodynamics apply, especially the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states. Right, the formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So for star_1 and star_2, the populations are in different energy levels. Let me denote the excited state as E2 and the lower state as E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. 

The excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. For star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the ratio of the excited to lower state is twice? So if for star_1, the population ratio is n1 = (number in E2)/(number in E1), and for star_2 it's n2 = (number in E2)/(number in E1), then the question says n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh, perhaps it means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 than in star_2. So if n1 is the ratio for star_1, and n2 for star_2, then n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, I think the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star:

n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
n2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Assuming that the statistical weights g2/g1 are the same for both stars because it's the same element and energy levels, so they cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio n1/n2 = exp
