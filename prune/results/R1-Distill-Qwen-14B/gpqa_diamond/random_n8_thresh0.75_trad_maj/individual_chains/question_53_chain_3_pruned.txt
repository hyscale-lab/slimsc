Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says that we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So the molecule has two substituents attached to a benzene ring. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a characteristic carbonyl stretch around 1740 cm^-1. So, the compound must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two signals are for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be either para, meta, or ortho. But the splitting of the aromatic protons can give clues about the substitution pattern.

Wait, but the substituents themselves might influence the splitting. For example, if the substituents are two strong activating groups, the aromatic protons might split into certain patterns. But without more information, maybe it's better to consider the substituents.

The NMR shows two signals for vinyl protons. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds. So maybe the substituent has a double bond. Let me think: an ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', or wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe one of the substituents is an ester, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the di-substituted aromatic ring: maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is an alkenyl or something that would have vinyl protons. Let me think: perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-). Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a substituent with a vinyl group, like CH2CH2... Hmm, no, maybe it's a substituent that brings in a double bond, like a propenyl group or something.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Let me think about that splitting. A doublet would suggest coupling with one adjacent proton, while a quartet of doublets (or doublet of quartets) could be more complex. Maybe they're part of a vinyl group next to another group.

Another thought: the presence of an ester group might be part of a substituent. For example, the substituent could be an ethyl group attached via an ester. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OCOOR), and the other substituent is an allyl group (CH2CH2CH2), but that might have more protons. Or maybe one substituent is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3, but that might not explain the vinyl-H.

Wait, let's consider that the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Let's say, for example, one substituent is -O-CO-O-R (wait, no, that would be a carbonate. Ester is -O-CO-R). So, substituent 1: -O-CO-R, substituent 2: -CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that might not explain the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a propenyl group, like CH2=CH2-CH2-O-, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Like, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)n-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait a minute, another approach. The NMR has two signals for aromatic protons. So, in a di-substituted benzene, the number of aromatic signals depends on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are para, then you have two equivalent protons, so one
