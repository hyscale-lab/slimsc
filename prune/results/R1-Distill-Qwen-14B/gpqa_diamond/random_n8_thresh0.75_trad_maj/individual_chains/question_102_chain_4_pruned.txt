Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair is identified in neural crest cells, and they want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets that form a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices, which I think usually means it's a dimer or something that can form a structure for binding.

Then, they constructed a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the order is ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, which is used for co-expressing two proteins from a single mRNA. So the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but the receptor's expression is controlled after the ligand's via an IRES.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette, allowing the genes to be expressed.

So in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by the stop cassette, then mCherry. The receptor is after the IRES, then its stop cassette, then eGFP. Wait, actually, the ligand ORF is at 5' and mCherry is fused. So the construct is ligand (CBA promoter), then loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. Then, after the receptor, which is under the IRES, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

When Cre is introduced, it would delete the stop cassette. So the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed as well.

They transfected this into primary astrocytes and used Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The actin loading shows it's working, so the blot is correct. Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells. Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, I think, so it's active in neural crest derivatives. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They expected green (eGFP) but didn't see it. Why?

The options are:
A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Hmm, paracrine means they act locally, not endocrine. But how would that affect expression? Maybe if the ligand is secreted and the receptor on the cell surface, but I'm not sure how that relates to the construct expression.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But why wouldn't it be expressed? The Western blot would detect the protein, but maybe it's not trafficked properly. But the question is why the green signal isn't seen.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand, so same promoter? Or is the receptor's expression dependent on the IRES? So maybe without the enhancer, the expression is low. But I'm not certain.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. But in the construct, the receptors are fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't excised, the ORF would be truncated. Alternatively, if the stop is not removed, no expression. But they used Cre, so maybe it's an issue with the lox sites.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic with lox-Cre. When Cre is introduced, it would delete the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing the expression of both mCherry and eGFP.

Wait, the setup is that the vector is lox-Cre. So
