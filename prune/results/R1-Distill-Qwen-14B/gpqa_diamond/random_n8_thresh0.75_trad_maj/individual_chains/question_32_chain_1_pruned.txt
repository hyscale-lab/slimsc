Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energy. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so I need to figure out the energy based on the speed given.

First, I think I need to find the mass of nucleus X. Wait, X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons. So, if it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, I need the mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass number and the individual masses of protons and neutrons. But wait, maybe I should just look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can use the standard values for protons and neutrons.

Protons have a mass of about 938 MeV/c² each. Neutrons are a bit heavier, about 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, maybe I should use more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the average, but perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the problem expects standard usage.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be (3 * m_p) + (3 * m_n). But wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but I'm not sure if that's considered here. Hmm. Wait, maybe this is a problem where I should just calculate using the sum of the rest masses, as the binding energy is negligible compared to the total mass when considering high speeds like 0.96c, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, but in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons, so maybe that should be considered.

Wait, but for the purpose of calculating the relativistic energy, perhaps I should use the actual rest mass of the nucleus, including its binding energy. So I need the exact mass of Li-
