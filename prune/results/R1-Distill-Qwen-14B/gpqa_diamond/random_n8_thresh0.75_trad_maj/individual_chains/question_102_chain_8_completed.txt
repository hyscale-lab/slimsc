Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal in the mouse model after crossing with SOX10-Cre. Let me go through the setup step by step.

So, the question is about a genetic construct used in mice. The construct is bicistronic, which means it has two genes under a single promoter. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. Wait, but I think I remember that in bicistronic vectors, the two ORFs are arranged such that the first is under a promoter, then maybe an IRES, and then the second ORF. Oh right, the promoter is before the ligand, then IRES before the receptor.

Looking at the setup: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. So the promoter would drive the ligand, and the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, allowing the receptor to be expressed as a second ORF. 

Now, the stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. The ligand has a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. So when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of both the ligand and receptor. But which Cre is used?

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they cross it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells and some other cell lineages. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in the same cells where SOX10 is active.

So the idea is that when the Cre is expressed in the SOX10-expressing cells, it would delete the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But the problem is that after the offspring are born, they don't show a green signal. The eGFP is attached to the receptor, so if the receptor is expressed and on the cell surface, we'd see green fluorescence under the microscope.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But expression of the eGFP would still occur, so why no signal? Maybe not the issue here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface. But the question says the mouse model is in the wt background, and the construct is correctly made. Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses CBA promoter, which is strong. So if the promoter isn't working, no expression. But in the setup, they tested the construct in primary astrocytes and saw signals. Wait, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, so the proteins are being expressed. So the promoter is working. So C is unlikely.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the ORF is not correctly in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed. But the vector is designed with IRES, which should allow for separate translation. Wait, maybe the IRES is between the receptor's ORF and eGFP? Or is the eGFP part of the same ORF as the receptor?

Wait, the construct is described as the receptor ORF at the 3' fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is in frame with eGFP, meaning a single ORF. The same for the ligand: it's fused to mCherry. So the ligand's ORF is followed by mCherry, but the stop is in the loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single protein.

Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the promoter drives the ligand, then after IRES, the receptor. So the two ORFs are arranged as ligand and then receptor, with IRES in between.

But how does the stop work? The ligand has a stop with loxP, meaning that without Cre, the ligand is expressed but not mCherry. Wait, no, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but the stop is between them, so in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a separate protein, but mCherry expression is blocked. When Cre is present, it deletes the stop, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single fusion protein.

Similarly, the receptor has a stop with lox2272, so without Cre, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, but the eGFP is not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP are expressed as a fusion.

In the mouse model, they're homozygous for the construct. They cross with SOX10-Cre, which would express Cre in certain cells, like neural crest derivatives. So in those cells, the stops are removed, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But in the offspring, there's no green signal. So why?

The Western blot in the in vitro experiment showed signals proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins were expressed. But wait, the Western blot is done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. If the stop cassettes are present (no Cre), then the ligand is expressed with a stop before mCherry, so mCherry is not produced. Similarly, the receptor is expressed without eGFP.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), so the stops are removed. So the eGFP should be expressed.

But maybe the issue is with the frame. If the loxP cassette is not correctly flanking the stop, then Cre might not delete it properly. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly, or the eGFP is not in frame.

Wait, the problem could be with the reading frame of the receptor-eGFP. If the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, and the eGFP is placed after that. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is in frame with the eGFP. But if the lox2272 site is not correctly placed, perhaps the frame is misaligned.

Wait, lox2272 is a different variant of the loxP site. I remember that loxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that's recognized by Dre recombinase. Oh wait, no, Cre can also recognize lox2272? Or wait, I think that lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site that is recognized by Cre but with a different recombination specificity. Because the default is loxP, but lox2272 is a site that allows for different recombination. But in this case, the Cre is the same as in the original construct.

Wait, no, the vector uses two different lox sites. The ligand has a stop between ligand and mCherry with loxP. The receptor has a stop between receptor and eGFP with lox2272.

So in the presence of Cre, the loxP site will be cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the lox2272 site would be cut by Cre, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together.

Wait, but does Cre recognize lox2272? I thought that Cre typically recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a mutant version that can also be recombined by Cre but with different pairing. So when Cre is present, both loxP and lox2272 sites would be deleted, allowing both fusions.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is expressed, so both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the Western blot, which was done on primary astrocytes, the proteins were expressed. Wait, but in the mouse, maybe the expression isn't happening in the cells where you look under the microscope.

Wait, the problem says that the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like Schwann cells and some other cells. So maybe the eGFP is only expressed in those cells. But if the experiment is looking for green fluorescence in a specific tissue, perhaps the cells expressing the eGFP are not the ones visualized. But the question says they don't see any green signal, which suggests that eGFP isn't expressed at all.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. So in that case, the construct would be transiently transfected. But in the mouse, the construct is probably integrated into the genome, so expression is more stable.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame. If the receptor is in frame with eGFP, then it should work, but if the ORF is disrupted because the stop wasn't removed correctly, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so maybe the receptor isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't allowing its translation. But then why would the ligand be expressed? Because the ligand is under the CBA promoter.

Wait, the CBA promoter is strong and should drive the ligand mRNA. Then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed from the same transcript. So perhaps without Cre, the ligand is expressed but not mCherry, and the receptor is expressed but not eGFP.

But when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse model, the eGFP is not expressed. So why?

Hmm, looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop wasn't correctly flanked by lox2272 sites, the deletion might not result in the eGFP being in frame with the receptor.

Wait, but the plasmid was tested in astrocytes, and the proteins were expressed. So the problem must be in the way the mouse model is set up.

Wait, another possibility: the vector uses IRES, which is supposed to drive the receptor's expression. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the CBA promoter is for the ligand, so the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But without Cre, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein. Wait, no, the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So the promoter is for the ligand, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed from the same mRNA. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed.

Wait, but the IRES is only for the receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, then IRES, then receptor. So the ligand is translated first, then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA.

In the mouse, the Cre is present, so both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed. But in the offspring, no green is seen, which suggests that the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

Another possibility: the lox2272 site isn't correctly flanked. Suppose that the stop is in a way that, upon Cre recombination, the eGFP is not properly inserted into the frame. So the fusion protein isn't made, and eGFP isn't expressed. So when you look under the microscope, you don't see green.

But how would that affect in vitro expression? The in vitro Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed. Wait, no, the Western blot was done on the transfected primary astrocytes. If the astrocytes don't have Cre, then the stops would remain, so ligand is expressed, but not mCherry, and receptor is expressed, but not eGFP. But the question says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So perhaps the proteins are expressed, but the eGFP isn't. Wait, but without Cre in the astrocytes, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. So why would the Western blot show expression?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify the setup again.

The construct is a bicistronic vector with ligand (5') and receptor (3') ORFs. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor is after IRES. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in a loxP cassette before mCherry. For the receptor, it's fused to eGFP, with a stop in lox2272 cassette before eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, ligand is expressed (without mCherry), and receptor is expressed (without eGFP). So in the mouse, which is homozygous for this, but then crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would delete the loxP and lox2272 sites, allowing both fusions.

But in the mouse after crossing, the offspring don't show green. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Possibility: the eGFP is not in frame. If the insertion of the stop was done incorrectly, the deletion might not correctly place eGFP into frame with the receptor. So when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP would be out of frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein or no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't being expressed.

But the in vitro Western blot showed expression. Wait, the Western blot was done on the primary astrocytes transfected with the plasmid. So in that case, the construct is present without Cre. So ligand ORF is expressed, but mCherry is not (because of the stop). Receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So in the Western, you'd only see the receptor's protein, but not eGFP. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, meaning that the proteins are expressed. Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are expressed, but not the mCherry or eGFP, why would the Western blot show a signal? Because the primary assay is looking for the overexpressed proteins using antibodies. So maybe the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor.

Wait, the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So in the Western blot, the presence of ligand and receptor proteins would show a signal. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed without the fluorescent proteins. But in the mouse, when Cre is present, the fusions should be expressed, including eGFP.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the construct is in the genome. So when Cre is present, the fusions are expressed. But perhaps in the mouse, the construct wasn't properly recombined because the loxP and lox2272 sites are not correctly placed. For example, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, if lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But Cre typically recognizes loxP and lox2272 sites, but maybe in the vector, the lox2272 site is not correctly designed. Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a different recombinase.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the in vitro Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the IRES is after the ligand, so the ligand is under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. So both ligand and receptor are expressed. But without Cre, the fusions (mCherry and eGFP) aren't expressed. But with Cre, they are.

But the mouse has the construct, and SOX10-Cre is providing Cre in specific cells. So in those cells, the fusions should be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the IRES is not functional, so the receptor isn't being translated. But why would the in vitro Western blot show the receptor? Because in the plasmid, the CBA promoter would drive both ligand and receptor, but in the absence of Cre, the receptor ORF is present.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is out of frame because the stop wasn't correctly flanked. So when Cre deletes the lox2272 stop, the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, so it's not expressed.

If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't show up, which aligns with option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct, but the eGFP isn't being properly processed, like being stuck in the ER or Golgi (option B). But why would the in vitro expression show the receptor on Western blot but not eGFP?

Wait, the Western blot was done on transfected cells without Cre, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor would. But the question says that the signal is proportional to actin, so perhaps the proteins are present.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's reevaluate each option:

A) Paracrine relationship. If ligand and receptor are paracrine, they act on other cells, but the eGFP is on the receptor, so expression should still occur. So why no green? Probably not the right answer.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's retained in the cell, but the eGFP would still fluoresce if on the surface. But in the Western blot, if the protein is made, it should show up. Maybe, but not the most likely.

C) Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is strong, so this is unlikely. Also, the in vitro expression suggests the promoter works.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly aligned, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP isn't in frame, so no expression. So no green signal.

So the most likely answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic genetic construct expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned downstream of an IRES element. The ligand-mCherry fusion is separated from the ligand ORF by a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, while the receptor-eGFP fusion is separated from the receptor ORF by a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. The construct is designed to allow Cre recombinase to delete these stop cassettes, enabling the expression of the fusion proteins.

The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and is crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green fluorescence is observed under the confocal microscope, suggesting that the receptor-eGFP fusion is not being expressed.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship refers to signaling between nearby cells. However, the absence of green fluorescence is unrelated to the paracrine nature of the ligand-receptor interaction. The issue lies in the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion, not its function. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP fusion were retained in the Golgi apparatus, it would not reach the cell surface for fluorescence visualization. However, the Western blot performed on transfected astrocytes showed that the receptor protein is expressed, indicating that the construct is functional and the protein is synthesized. This suggests that the issue is not related to trafficking but rather to expression. This option is less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the in vitro Western blot confirmed that the ligand and receptor proteins are expressed. This indicates that the promoter is functional, and the absence of an enhancer is not the issue. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   For the receptor-eGFP fusion to be expressed correctly, the receptor ORF and eGFP must be in the same reading frame. If the lox2272 stop cassette is not properly flanked or if the deletion by Cre does not align the receptor and eGFP in frame, the fusion protein will not be expressed. This would result in the absence of green fluorescence, as observed in the experiment. This is the most likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of green fluorescence is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame after Cre-mediated recombination. This prevents the proper expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein.

**Answer: D**
