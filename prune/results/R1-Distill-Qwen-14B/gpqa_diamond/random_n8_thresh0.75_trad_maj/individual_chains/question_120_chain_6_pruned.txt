Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's try to think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density in space is the same everywhere, right? So the number density of stars doesn't change with distance. 

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance—so a larger parallax means the star is closer. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs or something). So plx is inversely proportional to distance. 

So if I think in terms of distance, each unit of distance (like a parsec) would have a certain number of stars because the density is uniform. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of that shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², right? So the number of stars in a thin shell is 4πr² * n, where n is the number density (stars per volume). 

But the question is about parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx is 1/r (let's say r is in parsecs for simplicity), then r = 1/plx. So plx is p, so r = 1/p. 

Now, the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say we're looking at a small change in plx, dp. I need to find how many stars are in that range. So for each dp, what's the number of stars? 

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell (which corresponds to a range of plx) would relate to the surface area. But surface area in terms of r is 4πr² dr. But since r = 1/p, dr would be the change in radius when plx changes by dp. Let me relate dr to dp. Since r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Oh wait, because differentiating r with respect to p: dr/dp = -1/p². So dr = - (1/p²) dp. But since I'm considering a small positive change in p, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But when considering the number of stars, I think we can ignore the sign since we're talking about magnitudes. 

So the number of stars in a shell is 4π r² * n * dr, where n is the number density. Substituting r = 1/p and dr = (1/p²) dp (since I can ignore the negative for magnitude), we get:

Number of stars = 4π (1/p)^2 * n * (1/p²) dp 

Wait, let me verify that. Wait, no. The shell's thickness is dr, which is (1/p²) dp. So the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is number density (n) multiplied by the volume. So:

Number of stars in dp = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp 

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because the volume of the thin spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So, if r = 1/p, then r squared is (1/p)^2. And dr is (1/p²) dp. So the volume element is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. So that's 4π * 1/p^4 dp. 

Oh, wait. So the number of stars in a shell at distance r (which corresponds to plx p) is n * 4π r² dr. But since dr is (
