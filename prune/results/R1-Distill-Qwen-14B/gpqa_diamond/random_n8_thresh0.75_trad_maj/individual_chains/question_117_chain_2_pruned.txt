Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would exhibit optical activity, like rotating plane-polarized light.

The question asks which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. The options are four compounds, and I need to check each one.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism. The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it might have a plane of symmetry. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think: the main structure is [1,1'-biphenyl]. So the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate methyl esters.

Wait, the structure would have nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2' positions. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate. Wait no, actually, the numbering could be such that each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize this.

No, wait, no. The main compound is 6,6'-dinitro-[1
