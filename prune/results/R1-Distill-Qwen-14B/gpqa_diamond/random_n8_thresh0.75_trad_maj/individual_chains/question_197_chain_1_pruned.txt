Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is, right? Because without knowing the starting material, I can't determine the product. So the given data includes IR and NMR spectra. Let's look at the IR first.

The IR data shows strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That usually indicates the presence of OH or NH groups because those tend to absorb in that region. The peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's a broad peak in the IR around 3400, maybe it's an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have strong, broad O-H stretches. But wait, if the carbonyl is at 1720, that could align with a carboxylic acid (typically around 1700, but 1720 is possible). Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone.

But looking at the NMR data, the first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs) with 1H. That's a really high chemical shift; that's indicative of an aldehyde proton, right? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or, wait, carboxylic acids can have O-H protons around 10-12 ppm, but those are broad. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet integrating for 1H, which doesn't match a carboxylic acid because that would have more than one proton unless it's a substituted benzoic acid with only one -OH. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak in the 3400-2500 region, which would fit the O-H of a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is more likely an aldehyde proton. Because the O-H of a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak, but in the NMR, if it's a free -OH, like in a carboxylic acid, you'd expect a broad signal.
