Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should involve the neutralization of the acid.

The problem states that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the initial concentration will change because the volume is doubled. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Got it. So after dilution, the acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

But wait, when titrating, we're adding NaOH to this solution. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of what? The equivalence point volume, I think. Because the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (20+20). Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So when we titrate, the NaOH will react with this acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid, so 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence can be found. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the first part is 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So we're adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let's find out how much of the reaction has occurred.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so remaining is 0.00075 mol. Also, this produces 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So now, the solution after 25% titration is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. Because we're at a point before the equivalence point, the buffer equation should apply here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). So I'll need to calculate pKa. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 4.733 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 5 - 0.267 is 4.733? Wait, no, wait. Wait, log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, which rounds to about 4.73.

Now, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is moles of acetate divided by moles of acetic acid. Both are in the same volume, so it's (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 4.25, but looking at options, I see option A is 4.26. Hmm, so that's close. Maybe due to more precise calculation.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the pKa calculation. The exact value is Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute it accurately. Since log(1.85) is about 0.2672, so pKa is 4.7328, indeed about 4.73.

The ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is -0.4771. So 4.7328 - 0.4771 is 4.2557, which rounds to 4.26. So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, no: Wait, the acetate ion's Kb is Kw / Ka. So 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, actually, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 ÷ 1.85e-5. That's equal to (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration of acetate ion at equivalence. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (same as initial acetic acid). The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence (10 cm³). So total volume is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, for the hydrolysis reaction. Kb is 5.405e-10, which is very small, so the hydrolysis is minimal. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]
Assuming x is small, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So:

5.405e-10 = x^2 / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait a minute, that's higher than the options given. Let me check my calculations again.
