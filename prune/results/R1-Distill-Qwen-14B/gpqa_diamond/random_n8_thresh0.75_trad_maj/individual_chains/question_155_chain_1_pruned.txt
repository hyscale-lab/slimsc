Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in Pz given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle involves the standard deviation of an operator, so I guess I need to calculate the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared, then take the square root of the difference.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. The vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, since the operator Pz is diagonal in this basis, the matrix is diagonal with elements hbar, 0, and -hbar.

Right, so the state is a vector in this basis. To find the expectation value of Pz, I think I multiply the state vector by the Pz matrix and then take the inner product. Or wait, maybe I can compute it more directly since Pz is diagonal. Oh right, because if the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, each component of the state corresponds to the eigenvalue of Pz.

So each component |c_i|^2 gives the probability that the system is in the eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue p_i. So let's see. The state vector has components (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's compute their squares: (1/4) for the first and third components, and (1/2) for the second.

The eigenvalues of Pz are hbar (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -hbar (third). So the expectation value of Pz, <Pz>, would be sum over |c_i|^2 * p_i.

Calculating that: (1/4)*hbar + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-hbar) = (1/4 - 1/4) hbar = 0. So <Pz> is zero.

Wait, but then the expectation value of Pz squared, <Pz^2>, would be sum |c_i|^2 * (p_i)^2. So that's (1/4)*(hbar^2) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(hbar^2) = (1/4 + 1/4) hbar^2 = (1/2) hbar^2.

So the variance is <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2 = (1/2 hbar^2) - 0 = 1/2 hbar^2. Taking the square root, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 hbar^2) = hbar / sqrt(2). So that would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes the uncertainty is given as (Î”Pz)^2 = <Pz^2> - <Pz>^2. Since <Pz> is zero, it's just <Pz^2>.

So that's correct. So the uncertainty is hbar divided by sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The state vector is given as $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot p_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities and $p_i$ are the eigenvalues. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting the eigenvalues $p_1 = \hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, and $p_3 = -\hbar$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed similarly:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot p_i^2.
\]

The eigenvalues squared are $p_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $p_2^2 = 0$, and $p_3^2 = \hbar^2$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\
