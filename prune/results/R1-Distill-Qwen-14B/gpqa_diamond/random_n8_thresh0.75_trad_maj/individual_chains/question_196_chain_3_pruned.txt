Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But this is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the motion, maybe using relativistic equations of motion.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal would give v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so maybe that formula isn't directly applicable.

Relativistically, energy considerations change. The total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; you have to consider the relativistic energy, which includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in this case, the oscillator is moving, so maybe the energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the oscillation energy.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the potential is (1/2)k x². But in relativity, does the potential energy expression change? I'm not too sure. Maybe I should think about the energy conservation in the relativistic case.

In the rest frame of the oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement (x = A), all its energy would be potential. As it moves towards the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy converts into kinetic energy. So at x=0, the speed is maximum.

In the non-relativistic case, the speed is sqrt(kA²/m). But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy E at maximum displacement is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Hmm, or maybe is the potential energy just (1/2)k x² as before?

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is (1/2)k x². So when the oscillator is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². Then, when it's at x = 0, all
