Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The neutralization reaction typically releases heat, which is why it's exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, you usually get a neutralization reaction. But wait, HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So mixing them all together should result in some acid-base reaction.

Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is also a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But I need to figure out the stoichiometry here. Let me write down the concentrations and volumes first.

Data given:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait, but Ba(O
