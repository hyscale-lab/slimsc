Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's like a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. Since the starting material is a dibromide, I'm thinking elimination might happen here. Wait, but wait—if it's a vicinal dibromide (two adjacent Br atoms), heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. But I should think about what the product structure would look like.

Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so when the two Brs are removed, they might form a double bond in the bridge structure. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would dehydrohalogenate to form 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, I'm a bit confused—adamantane has a structure where each bridge is a single bond. If two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, removing them would form a double bond between those two carbons, making a bicyclic diene.

So product 1 would be 1,3-diene (but since it's adamantane, it's more like a cyclohexene fused structure, maybe). The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought of elimination to form an alkene. Because alkenes typically have C=C stretches around 1650 cm^-1. So maybe I was wrong about the reaction.

Hmm, wait, another possibility: perhaps it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, epoxides are more for when you have a good leaving group and a base, but I don't think that fits here. Wait, wait—the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but an elimination followed by a different process? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, KOH could also cause a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a
