Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking it down step by step. I remember that NMR is crucial in determining the structure of compounds, so I'll start there.

Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H makes me think of two equivalent CH3 groups. Because in a triplet, each proton in the group is coupled with two others. Wait, wait, the triplet for 6Hâ€”so maybe it's two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has three H's, so two would give 6H. That makes sense.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet usually implies coupling with a neighboring group with three protons. Wait, quartet has four peaks, which comes from being split by a group with three protons. So, each of the 4H is next to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3. Wait, 4H could be two CH2 groups. Oh, wait, but if it's a quartet, each of those H's is adjacent to a group with three H's. So perhaps that 4H is a CH2 that's next to a CH3. Let me think: if the CH2 is next to a CH3, the CH3 would have a triplet because each H in CH2 would couple with the CH3. But wait, the triplet in the NMR is from the CH3 group, right? Because CH3 would split into a quartet if next to a CH2, but wait.

Wait, the triplet is for 6H, so that's two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has three H's. So how are they arranged? Maybe they are adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2(C3H7)2? Wait, maybe it's (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, think about the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3 groups) would be next to a CH2. Because each CH3 is next to a CH2, so the CH2 would be a quartet. Because each H in the CH2 is next to a CH3 with three H's, so each H in CH2 would split into a quartet. But wait, the quartet in the NMR corresponds to the CH2 group, which has four H's. Wait, no, if it's a quartet for 4H, that would be two CH2 groups each with 2 H's. So perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2? Wait, that doesn't seem quite right.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about possible structures. The triplet (6H) suggests two CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2. The quartet (4H) suggests two CH2 groups each adjacent to a CH3. So maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2 something. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Like, the structure could be CH2CH2(C2H5)2
