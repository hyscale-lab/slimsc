Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm. Let me see. So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. I think I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms relates to their temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are. 

So the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the same as k (Boltzmann's constant) because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So maybe that's going to come into play here.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann distribution equation. The number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one is given by the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-Î”E/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much. So I think the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait. Let me read again. It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So maybe the ratio is n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps that the excitation (like the population of the higher level) is twice as high in star
