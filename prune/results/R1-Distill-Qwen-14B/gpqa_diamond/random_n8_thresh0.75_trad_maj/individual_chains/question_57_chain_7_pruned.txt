Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitudes have both real and imaginary parts, which relate to different aspects of the scattering process, maybe the cross-section or something.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Wait, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So I think that means we only consider these five. But wait, phase shifts are usually labeled as l=0,1,2,... So δ₀ is for l=0, δ₁ for l=1, and so on up to δ₄=13°, which is l=4. So we have phase shifts up to l=4.

Now, the scattering amplitude is given by something like f(θ, ϕ), and I think for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0°, because the beam is coming in along, say, the z-axis. So when θ=0, we are looking along the beam. 

I remember that the scattering amplitude f is related to the phase shifts δₗ. The general expression for f in terms of phase shifts involves a sum over l of (something with spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials). Wait, more specifically, the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ,ϕ) = ∑ [ ( (2l+1) / (2) ) * ( e^{2iδₗ} - 1 ) * Pₗ(cosθ) ) ]

But wait, that's the real part? Or the imaginary part? Alternatively, I think the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the imaginary part of this sum. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the scattering amplitude can be expressed as:

f(θ,ϕ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδₗ} - 1 ] Pₗ(cosθ) e^{i l ϕ} }

Wait, but what's k? Oh, k is the wave number. For electrons with energy E, k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but I might not need to compute that directly if the formula ends up not requiring it.

But in this problem, we're only asked about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction, which is
