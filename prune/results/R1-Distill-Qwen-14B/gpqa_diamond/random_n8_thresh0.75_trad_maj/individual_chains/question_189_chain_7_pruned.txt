Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about particles and broken symmetries. The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where the underlying laws are symmetric, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. The particles that emerge from such a broken symmetry are called Goldstone bosons. So, I need to think about each option and see which one doesn't fit into this category.

Starting with option A, the Phonon. Phonons are the quasiparticles associated with the vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise due to the quantization of the normal modes of vibration. But wait, I think phonons are related to the breaking of translational symmetry. In a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken because the structure repeats periodically. So the phonons would be related to this broken symmetry. But wait, are they Goldstone bosons? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think in the case of a crystal, the symmetry is broken, leading to Goldstone modes, which phonons might be examples of. Or maybe not, because phonons are more about the lattice vibrations and are bosons, but perhaps they don't arise from a continuous symmetry breaking. Hmm.

Option B is Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetic materials. They arise from the broken rotational symmetry in magnets. I'm pretty sure that skyrmions are associated with broken symmetries, so they would be linked to some Goldstone-like particles. But wait, maybe not exactly Goldstone because they're topological, but the concept is similar.

Option C is Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They emerge from the broken symmetry of the magnetic order. For example, in an antiferromagnet, the system has a broken rotational symmetry, and the magnons are the Goldstone bosons of that symmetry breaking. So magnons are definitely associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Option D is Pion. Pions are the lightest mesons and are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the low-energy limit of QCD, and the pions are the corresponding Goldstone bosons. So pions are clearly linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So the question is which one is NOT associated with this. So I need to find the particle that doesn't come from a spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Wait, let me think again about each option
