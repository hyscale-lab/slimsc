Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So the problem relates to the phosphate buffer system. I remember that orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which in turn is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion). 

Wait, so the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is a +1 ion and there are two of them, so the anion is HPO4^2-). 

So the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. This sounds like a buffer solution because it's a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So I can probably use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. But wait, which Ka value do I use? The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). 

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the relevant pKa would be Ka2, since Ka2 is the dissociation of H2PO4^- into H+ and HPO4^2-. Right, because:
H2PO4^- <-> H+ + HPO4^2-; Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

Wait, but the Henderson equation uses pKa, so pKa2 would be log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.209. Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that accurately. The pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that:

log(6.2) is about 0.792, and log(1e-8) is -8, so 6.2e-8 is 10^(-8 + 0.792) = 10^-7.208. So pKa2 ≈ 7.208.

Wait, but wait, I might have that backwards. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 multiplied by 10^-8. So the log is log(6.2) + log(10^-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. But since pKa is the negative log, it's 7.208. Right.

So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem isn't asking for pH; it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, that's a different thing. Oh wait, because in the solution, HPO4^2- can further deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

So I'm a bit confused. The question is about orthophosphate (PO4^3-), which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So to find [PO4^3-], I might need to consider the third dissociation step, which has Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify the phosphate species. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So the three dissociation steps are:

1) H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1=7.5e-3
2) H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2=6.2e-8
3) HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O). But the problem is asking about PO4^3- concentration. That would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, so in the solution, the HPO4^2- can lose another H+ to become PO4^3-. The amount of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation, which has a very small Ka, meaning it's a weak process. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But wait, since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the pH is around the pKa2 of 7.208. Let me compute the pH first using the Henderson equation.

First, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

The solution volume is 0.2 liters.

1.00 g of KH2PO4: Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol. So that's 0.007346 moles of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol. That's HPO4^2-.

So in 0.2 L, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02806 M.

So using the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.02806 / 0.03673).

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) is approximately log(0.76) ≈ -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.117 ≈ 7.091.

Now, what is the concentration of PO4^3-? That comes from the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12.

At pH 7.091, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The equation for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Since [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.091) ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.29e-8.

Let me compute the numerator first:

1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8:

5.0508e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ (5.0508 / 8.29) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.609 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but that's 6.09e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me recheck my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, let me re-calculate the pH step again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson equation.

The ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02806 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) ≈ -0.116 (since 10^-0.116 ≈ 0.7647).

So pH is 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.092) ≈ 7.94e-8? Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate 10^(-7.092):

10^(-7) is 1e-7=1e-7=0.0000001=1e-7.

The exponent -7.092 is -7 -0.092.

So 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.817 ≈ 8.17e-8.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 10^(-7.091) was about 8.29e-8. So my previous calculation is correct. So [H+] is approximately 8.17e-8 M.

Now, back to [PO4^3-]:

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.17e-8.

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.17e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.17e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.17) * (1e-14 / 1e-8) )= (0.618) * (1e-6) )= 6.18e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.18e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let's re-calculate the exact numbers.

First, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = let me compute that.

136.09 g is 1 mole. 1 g is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log (0.02806 / 0.03673).

Compute the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03673 = 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) = log(7.647e-1) ≈ log(7.647) -1 ≈ 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.

Then [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).

10^(-0.092) is approximately 0.817 as before. So [H+] ≈ 8.17e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So ([PO4^3-] )= (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.17e-8.

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.17e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.17e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.17) * 1e-6.

5.0508 / 8.17 ≈ 0.618. So 0.618e-6 = 6.18e-7 M. So approximately 6.18e-7.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to my calculation of 6.18e-7. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately.

Let me recompute the ratio 0.02806 / 0.03673.

0.02806 ÷ 0.03673.

Let me calculate 0.02806 / 0.03673.

Approximately, let me compute 2806 / 3673.

Let me compute 3673 × 0.7647.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the exact log value.

Wait, the ratio is (0.02806)/(0.03673) = 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) = using a calculator approach:

We know that log(0.7) ≈ -0.1549, log(0.7647) is higher than that. Let me see.

Another approach: log(0.7647) = log(7647 *1e-4) = log(7647) -4.

Wait, no, maybe it's easier to use a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations more accurately.

Wait, let me check the initial moles again.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 = 0.007346 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005612 mol.

So the concentrations are correct.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the solution assumes that the contribution of the third dissociation is negligible and thus uses the Henderson equation to find [PO4^3-]. But I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but in any case, from my calculations, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.18e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M). So I think the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, wait. The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So perhaps the pH is such that some of the HPO4^2- could dissociate further into PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH first and then use that to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, another approach: The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the Henderson equation as I did.

Then, the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, setting up the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We already have [H+] as 8.17e-8, [HPO4^2-] as 0.02806 M.

So plugging in:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.17e-8.

Which is (5.0508e-14) / 8.17e-8 ≈ 6.18e-7.

Which is around 6.18e-7 M.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.18e-7, option A is 6.24e-7. Hmm, perhaps I should re-calculate the exact numbers.

Wait, let me compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.092, so [H+] = 10^(-7.092).

Using a calculator approach:

10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).

10^(-0.092) can be computed using the Taylor series or using logarithm tables, but perhaps I can approximate it more accurately.

Alternatively, since 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 0.092 is slightly less than 0.1. So 10^(-0.092) is approximately 0.817.

Wait, more accurately, the value of log(8) is about 0.903, so 10^0.903 ≈8, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

ln(10^x) = x * ln(10).

So for x= -0.092, ln(10^-0.092) = -0.092 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2119.

So e^(-0.2119) ≈ 1 - 0.2119 + (0.2119)^2/2 - (0.2119)^3/6.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator, but perhaps 10^(-0.092) ≈ 0.817.

So [H+] ≈ 8.17e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.17e-8 = (5.0508e-14) / 8.17e-8 ≈ 6.18e-7.

Wait, perhaps the more precise calculation of the ratio would give a slightly higher or lower value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, let me double-check the moles:

KH2PO4: 1 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1 g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005612 mol.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is incorrect? Because the solution contains both, but perhaps the phosphate species can go further into PO4^3- due to the high pH?

Wait, the pH is around 7.09, which is slightly above the pKa2 of 7.208? No, wait, 7.09 is below 7.208. So the pH is lower than pKa2, meaning that the HPO4^2- is the base, and H2PO4^- is the acid. So the majority of the phosphate species would be in the H2PO4^- form. But I'm not sure if that affects the calculation of PO4^3-.

Another thought: maybe the contribution of PO4^3- from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- is needed. Wait, but H2PO4^- can't directly form PO4^3- without going through HPO4^2-.

Thus, the only source of PO4^3- is the HPO4^2- dissociation.

So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but another thing: when I calculated [PO4^3-], I assumed that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M. But in reality, some of it dissociates into PO4^3- and H+. So the actual [HPO4^2-] would be slightly less than 0.02806 M. But since Ka3 is so small, the change is negligible. So the initial approximation should be valid.

Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.18e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M). So I think the correct answer is A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate into H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, respectively. The relevant dissociation for PO₄³⁻ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L.  
- \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = \frac{0.007346 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}\).  
- \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = \frac{0.005612 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\). The relevant \(pK_a2\) is:  
\[
pK_a2 = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02806}{0.03673}\right).
\]
The ratio is:  
\[
\frac{0.02806}{0.03673} \approx 0.7647, \quad \log(0.7647) \approx -0.116.
\]
Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\)
Using the dissociation equation for HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]
At \(\text{pH} = 7.092\), \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.17 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.17 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
Calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806) \approx 5.0508 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Divide by \([\text{H⁺}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.17 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.18 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated concentration of \(\text{PO₄³⁻}\) is approximately \(6.18 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

**Answer: A**
