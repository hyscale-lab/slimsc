Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see... The question is about finding the uncertainty of the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Wait, the setup. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, and their matrix forms are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I guess I need to compute the uncertainty ∆P_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ∆A = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So here, A is P_z. 

First, I'll need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. Then find ⟨P_z²⟩, subtract the square of ⟨P_z⟩, and take the square root of that.

But wait, how do I compute these expectations? The state is given as a vector, so I can represent it as a column vector, let's call it |ψ⟩. Then ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ, and ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Wait, but what's P_z? Looking back at the question, the matrix for P_z is:

First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So that would be (ħ², 0, ħ²), since (-ħ)^2 is ħ².

So let me write out the state vector ψ as given. Its components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me confirm that this is a normalized vector. Calculate the sum of the squares:

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = (1/2) + 1/2 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. The columns of P_z are the eigenstates, which the basis vectors are. So each component of ψ will multiply the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, ψ is a column vector. Let me think, ψ = [a; b; c], where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is a* (P_z)_11 * a + b* (P_z)_22 * b + c* (P_z)_33 * c. Wait, no, wait: Actually, when you have a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is the sum of |component_i|^2 multiplied by the diagonal element. Because ψ is in the basis of P_z, each component is already an eigenstate. So yeah, that makes sense.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ)
a is -1/2, |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4
b is 1/√2, |b|^2 is 1/2
c is -1/2, |c|^2 is 1/4

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)* ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (ħ/4 - ħ/4) + 0 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. The expectation value of P_z is zero.

Next, calculate ⟨P_z²⟩. That's a^2 * (P_z)_11² + b^2 * (P_z)_22² + c^2 * (P_z)_33².

Wait, P_z² is a diagonal matrix with (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²)
= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ²
= (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2.

So now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty would be the square root of the variance, so √(ħ²/2) = ħ /√2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
