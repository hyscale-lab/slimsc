Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Alright, the question says both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter periodâ€”only a third that of Planet_2. Oh wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right?

The host stars have the same radii, but the one hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive. So, even though they're the same size, the more massive star might be hotter or have different characteristics, but for transit probability, I think it's more about the size ratio.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The transit probability formula, I think it's something like (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait no, no, that's the depth of the transit. For the probability, the formula is (R_star / a) * something. Oh right, I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to be in the right orbital plane for us to see the transit. So the formula is something like (R_star / a) multiplied by (something about the orbital inclination), but more accurately, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(something else?), or maybe it's just (R_star / a) * (1 / (something else?)). Wait, no, the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * ( (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2) ) ) )? Or wait, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, but multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. Oh wait, no. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_*/a) * [some function], but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is roughly (R_*/a) * (1/(something else?)).

Wait, I think the
