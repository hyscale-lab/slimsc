Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The pH changes as the reaction proceeds.

Let me break it down into parts. The first part is the initial dilution. Then, the titration process, and calculating pH at certain points.

First, initial dilution:

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So, the concentration of acetic acid after dilution will change.

Calculating the moles of acetic acid before dilution. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Let me think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M, and the volume is 40 cm³. So moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So, NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, 25% of what? I think it refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Alternatively, maybe 25% of the way to equivalence. Hmm, same thing.

So, first, let's tackle the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. So, after reaction, moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by 0.00025.

So, moles remaining of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

Total volume of the solution at this point is original 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is given from Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85 ×10^-5.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73. Because log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.73.

So, pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Let's round that to 4.25.

Now, looking at the options, let's see. Option A is pH 4.26 at 25%, which is close. So that's a candidate.

Next, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So, after equivalence, the solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate ions, which will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

Wait, but wait, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base), which will hydrolyze.

So, the concentration of acetate ions is crucial. Let me calculate that.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles are 0.001, same as the initial moles of acetic acid.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion will undergo hydrolysis: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. We can set up the equilibrium expression.

Let me denote [OH^-] as x. Then:

Kb = ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x^2) / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small (~5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6. Then, pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ ?

Log(3.288) is about 0.5165, so pOH ≈ 5.4835.

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 5.4835 = 8.5165.

Approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, is Kb correct? Let me compute it again.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Yes, that's correct.

Then, Kb = 5.405e-10.

So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Square root is about 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is approximately 0.517. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483.

So pOH is 5.483. pH is 14-5.483=8.517, which is approximately 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that matches.

Wait a second, but let's make sure that in the first part, I correctly calculated the concentrations.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³. Moles of HA: 0.00075, moles of A-:0.00025.

Concentration HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration A-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio A-/HA: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is log(0.333) = -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close.

So, at 25% titration, pH ≈4.26, and at equivalence, pH≈8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Option D is 4.57; 6.92.

Hmm, but I think I must have made a mistake because I recall that the pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is higher than 7, but wait, I calculated 8.52, which is correct. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: Wait, is the 25% titration based on the volume of the solution after dilution? Or is it 25% of the equivalence volume?

Wait, the problem says "25% titration", which I think refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point. So, equivalence is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% refers to the amount of acid neutralized. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted.

Wait, because moles of acid is 0.001. So 25% is 0.00025 moles. Which is the same as adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, because 0.00025 moles = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L. So same result.

So, the initial approach is correct.

Hmm. So, the calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, let me check the options again:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52.

Option D says 4.57; 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should use the approximation for the buffer solution with a 1:3 ratio.

Wait, when HA and A- are in a ratio of 3:1 (0.00075/0.00025=3), the pH is pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 -0.477= 4.253.

Which rounds to 4.25. So 4.26 is correct.

At equivalence, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of acetate ions. So, Kb is 5.405e-10. So, [OH] = sqrt( (5.405e-10)*0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.483, so pH is 8.517.

So, 8.52 is correct.

So, the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution?

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles is 20e-3 L * 0.05 = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake when adding the volumes for the buffer solution. Let me check the total volume at 25% titration.

At 2.5 cm³ added, total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use exact calculations without approximating.

Wait, for the buffer:

n_HA = 0.00075 mol.

n_A- = 0.00025 mol.

Volume is 0.0425 L.

So, exactly, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.0176470588 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.00588235294 M.

Ratio is (0.00588235294)/(0.0176470588) = 0.333333333.

Log(0.333333333) is exactly -0.4771.

So pH =4.73 -0.4771=4.2529, which is 4.253. So, 4.26 is correct.

Hmm, so the calculations seem correct. Therefore, option A is correct.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is about the pH at 25% of the volume added, but perhaps I should have considered the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, but initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, as I calculated. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.00025 moles) to neutralize 25% of that.

Wait, no, because 0.001 moles is the total, so 25% is 0.00025.

So, I think my approach is correct.

Thus, the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution and titration process.

### Step 1: Initial Dilution
We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid remain the same, but the concentration changes:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The new concentration after dilution is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Titration and Equivalence Point
When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) in a total volume of \(40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3\). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.288 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Step 3: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) has been added, which is \(2.5 \, \text{cm}^3\) of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)},
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log{\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right)}.
\]

The ratio is:

\[
\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333,
\]

and:

\[
\log{(0.3333)} \approx -0.477.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
