Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. 

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. I think I should first normalize this state. Because when you're given a state like this, you often have to find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). Let's compute their magnitudes squared. For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For (2 -i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because when you square it, you get 1/7, which would make the total sum 1.

So, the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator whose matrix representation is A with elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because Pauli X has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal, but here A has ħ/2 off-diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, let me make sure. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it becomes [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That's correct.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x. But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as σ_x because A is just a scaled version. So the eigenstates are the same, just their eigenvalues are scaled by ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities without considering the eigenstates. Hmm. Alternatively, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are
