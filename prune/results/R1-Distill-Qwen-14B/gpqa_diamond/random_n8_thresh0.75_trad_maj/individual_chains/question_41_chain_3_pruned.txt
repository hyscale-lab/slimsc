Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's see what the question says. A light beam is moving through glass with a certain index of refraction, n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, it's about how the speed of light is perceived in different frames. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Oh right, because when light enters a medium, its speed decreases proportionally to the refractive index.

But then, the medium itself is moving. So I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Oh wait, but wait, the velocities in relativity add a bit differently than in classical mechanics. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, wait, that's when you have two objects moving relative to each other. But in this case, the medium is moving, and the light is within that medium.

Wait, let me think again. The light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n. But the medium itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the lab frame sees the medium moving towards them, same direction as the light. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium, but adjusted for relativity. Or maybe it's not that simple.

Wait, no. Because in the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, how do we compute the light's speed?

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). Here, what's u? In the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab would see the light moving at u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² ). Let me compute that.

Simplify the denominator: 1 + ( (c v) )/(n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c). Wait, c is 1 in units where c
