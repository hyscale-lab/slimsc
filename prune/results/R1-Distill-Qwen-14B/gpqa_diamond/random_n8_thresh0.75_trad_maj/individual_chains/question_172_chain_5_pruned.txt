Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium. 

Wait, what's LTE? Oh right, in LTE, the gas is in thermal equilibrium, so the distribution of particles across energy levels follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. 

The excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, ΔE is the energy difference, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars, so g_upper and g_lower should be the same for both star_1 and star_2. So the ratio of the populations depends only on the exponential term. 

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, actually, wait: the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, I think that means the ratio of excited atoms to unexcited is higher in star_1. So, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is the same for both stars. So for each star, the ratio is:

R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But since g_upper/g_lower is the same for both, I can ignore it for the ratio of R1 to R2.

So the ratio R1/R2 would be exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) 

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly
