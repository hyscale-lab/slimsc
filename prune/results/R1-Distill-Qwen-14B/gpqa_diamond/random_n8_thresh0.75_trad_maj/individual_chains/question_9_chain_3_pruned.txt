Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry means the molecule has a threefold axis of rotation and some kind of mirror planes. Wait, or is it a combination of rotation and reflection? Let me think.

First, I should probably recall what each of these molecules looks like. The options are all organic compounds, so I'll have to visualize their structures based on the names.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think that's a borane compound with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Boron typically has three substituents, so that makes sense. The structure would be something like B with three isopropyl groups. So each isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. Each substituent is the same, so maybe the molecule has some symmetry. But wait, three identical groups around a central atomâ€”like trigonal planar arrangement. So for symmetry, a C3 axis would be possible. But what about the mirror planes? I'm not so sure. Because each isopropyl is symmetric itself, maybe the whole molecule has C3 symmetry. But wait, does it have a plane of symmetry as well? Because C3h would imply that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the central atom and some substituents, then it might have that. Alternatively, maybe it's just C3 without the mirror, so maybe that's not the case. I'm a bit confused here.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, right? It's like a norbornane structure but with an amine group. The structure is a bridge bicy
