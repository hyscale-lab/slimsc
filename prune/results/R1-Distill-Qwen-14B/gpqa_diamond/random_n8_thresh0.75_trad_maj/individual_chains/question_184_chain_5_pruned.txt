Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents will direct the incoming groups to specific positions. So, the order in which I add the substituents matters because each group will influence where the next one attaches.

Looking at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw its structure mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, actually, wait. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me visualize this. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, in a benzene ring, that would mean the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions, all meta to each other? Or wait, no, 1,2,3 are adjacent, so they're ortho and meta.

Wait, maybe I should number them differently. Let's think about it. The benzene ring has six positions. Let's imagine substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So that would be adjacent (ortho) to each other. But I'm not sure; maybe the numbering is different.

Wait, no, the IUPAC numbering would place the substituents in the order of priority. Let me think about functional groups. The substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The order of priority for substituents in IUPAC is: nitro (highest), then ethoxy, then alkyl groups. So the nitro group would get the lowest possible number. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the question isn't about numbering but about directing effects. Let's think about how each substituent affects the next substitution.

So, benzene is the starting material. The first reaction probably introduces one substituent. Then the next, and so on. Each substituent will activate or deactivate the ring and determine the position where the next group adds.

So, the substituents in the target are: nitro (which is a meta director), ethoxy (ortho/para director), and tert-butyl (which is an activating group, ortho/para director because it's an alkyl group). Wait, but tert-butyl is a bulky group; maybe it's more likely to add para, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors. So when adding the first substituent, if it's a nitro group, that would deactivating and meta-directing. Ethoxy is activating and ortho/para. Tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para.

But the target has three substituents, so I need to add three groups. Let's think about the order of addition. The order will determine where each substituent goes.

So, the target has three substituents: nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. Let's think about how each addition affects the next.

I think the key is to plan the order of adding substituents considering their directing effects.

Let me think: Let's say I add nitro first. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, after nitration, the ring is deactivating. Then, adding the next group would go to the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but the target has substituents at 1, 2, and 3
