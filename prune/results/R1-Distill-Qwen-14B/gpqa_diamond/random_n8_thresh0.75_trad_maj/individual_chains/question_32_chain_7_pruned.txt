Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A to D, with various GeV values.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons=6 nucleons. So the atomic number is 3, mass number 6. So X is Li-6.

Next, I need to find the energy. Since it's a relativistic particle, I should probably use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but waitâ€”the question is about the energy of the collider. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) as the energy of the particle. So I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So I'm guessing that they're referring to the kinetic energy that the nucleus has. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm.

Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy
