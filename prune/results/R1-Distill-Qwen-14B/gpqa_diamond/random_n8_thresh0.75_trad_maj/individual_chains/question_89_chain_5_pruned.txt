Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The first part of the question involves a reaction with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives a product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let me break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1. When dibrominated compounds react with a strong base like KOH, especially in such a high temperature, elimination reactions are common. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3 in adamantane are adjacent?), perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's on opposite sides, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, but in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three CH2 groups. Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is part of a bridge. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons. When KOH is used, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene.

So, if we have two adjacent Br atoms, eliminating them would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane? I think the product would be a diene. Wait, but the NMR data shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet? Or maybe a triplet? Or perhaps a doublet. Wait, 4.79 is usually around the range of an -OH proton, but wait, product 1 is a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because an epoxide would have a triplet for the adjacent protons, but the IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe an alcohol wasn't formed. Wait, maybe it's
