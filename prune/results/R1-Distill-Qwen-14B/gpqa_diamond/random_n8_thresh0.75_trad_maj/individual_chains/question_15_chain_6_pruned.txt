Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me see. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both orbits are circular.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers would prefer to observe the one with higher probability.

I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment of the orbit. Since both are Earth-like, assuming similar radii, but the star's radius matters too.

The probability formula I remember is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor, but wait, wait. Oh wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / a)² * (something else), or maybe it's (R_*/(a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_*/a). But wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing this up.
