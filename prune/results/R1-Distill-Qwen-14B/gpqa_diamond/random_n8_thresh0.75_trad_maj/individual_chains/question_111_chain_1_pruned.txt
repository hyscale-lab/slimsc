Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then, I'll match them to the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking this is an enolate formation reaction. Enolate chemistry usually involves deprotonation at a position alpha to the carbonyl group, leading to nucleophilic attack.

The starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to imagine its structure. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1, so the numbering would have the carbonyl at C1. Then, the substituents are at C2 (ethyl) and C6 (methyl?), wait wait, wait. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl—so that would be at C2 (ethyl and a methyl?) or perhaps C2 has an ethyl and C6 has another methyl. Wait, 2-ethyl would mean an ethyl group is attached to C2. And 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at both C2 and C6? Or wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So at C2, there's both an ethyl and a methyl group attached? Because the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh wait, no—each substituent is a separate group. Let me think again. The parent is cyclohexanone. The substituents are: at position 2, an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Also, position 2 has a methyl as well? Wait, no, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. No, wait—maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? No, wait, the numbering would mean that. So the substituents at C2 are ethyl and methyl? Or perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, let me clarify. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group at position 1. Then, at position 2, there are two substituents: ethyl and methyl. Because the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. Position 6 has a methyl group. So 2 has ethyl and methyl, 6 has methyl. So the structure is a cyclohexanone with substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). Hmm, that's a bit crowded around C2.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. So t-BuOK is a
