Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffers and phosphate ions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says: We have a solution of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO₄³−. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that orthophosphate is HPO₄³−, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (from H3PO4 losing a proton) and the conjugate acid of PO4^3− (which would gain a proton). So this is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, actually, in this case, the components are a weak acid and its conjugate base, so it's a buffer. 

Wait, KH₂PO4 is K+ H2PO4^-. Its formula is K H2PO4. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So Na2HPO4 is Na+ HPO4^2−? Wait, no: Na2HPO4 is actually Na+ HPO4^2−, but wait, wait. Let me think. H3PO4 has three protons. So, H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2− (Ka2), and HPO4^2− → H+ + PO4^3− (Ka3). 

So, H2PO4^- is the first dissociation, HPO4^2− is the second, and PO4^3− is the third. But in this problem, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, in solution, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2−. 

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−. Wait, but wait: HPO4^2− is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, and H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2−. So, this is a buffer system between H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2− (its conjugate base). So the buffer equation would be H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2−. 

So, the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2−, would be influenced by this buffer. But how do I find it?

I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2−, which is the base in this buffer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the ratio and then find the concentration.

Wait, but perhaps I should first calculate the moles of each component. Because the problem gives grams of each salt, so I can compute moles.

So, for KH2PO4: Mw is 136
