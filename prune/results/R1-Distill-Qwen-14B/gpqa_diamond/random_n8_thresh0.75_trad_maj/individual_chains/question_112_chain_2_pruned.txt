Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that |alpha> is the state of an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the coefficients probably don't add up to 1. Because, you know, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized so that the sum of the probabilities is 1.

Wait, right, normalization means that the inner product of the state with itself should be 1. So I need to calculate the inner product. Let's denote |alpha> as a = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product <a|a> would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2-i)(1+i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, no, wait: the coefficients are a = (1+i, 2-i), so the inner product is a1* a1 + a2* a2. Because it's like (a1*, a2*) multiplied by (a1, a2).

So let's compute each part. a1 is (1+i), so a1* is (1-i). a2 is (2-i), so a2* is (2+i). So the inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). 

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Because each coefficient is a_i, so the modulus squared is |a_i|^2. So for a1, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So 1^2 + 1^2 is 2. Similarly, a2 is (2 - i), so |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), wait no, wait, the norm is sqrt(2+5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says the state is proportional to that. So the actual state is 1/sqrt(7) times (1
