Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to remember the units for enthalpy.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But when dealing with different acids and a base, maybe I should find the moles of H+ and OH- ions involved and see which is the limiting reagent.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Starting with HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. It's also a strong acid and it's diprotic, meaning each mole gives two H+ ions. So first, find moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives two H+, total H+ is 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-. So each mole gives two OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, let me recap. HCl gives 0.1 mol H+. H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+. So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The base gives 0.2 mol OH-.

In neutralization, H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-.

So the limiting reagent here is OH- because there's 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-. So OH- will run out first, meaning all 0.2 moles will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but if it's a strong acid, it'll donate both H+ ions. So in this case, all of it is providing both H+.

So the total H+ is HCl's 0.1 plus H2SO4's 0.18, so 0.28. OH- is 0.2. So the reaction would consume 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

Now, the enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ that reacted. Since each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases about 57 kJ (or -57 kJ, since it's exothermic). So the total enthalpy change would be moles reacted * 57 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes the enthalpy is given per mole of H2O formed. Each mole of H2O is from one H+ and one OH-, so each mole releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles of H2O would be 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's negative, so -11.4 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization' when these are mixed. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the total H+ and OH- as the limiting reagent is OH-.

So the neutralization involves 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-. So n = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the enthalpy per mole is usually for one mole of reaction. So the question is, how much heat is released when all the OH- is neutralized.

So, if the limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles), then the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in this case, only part of it might react. Oh wait, no. Because the OH- is the limiting reagent, all of it reacts, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but let me think again. H+ total is 0.28. OH- is 0.2. So the reaction will consume 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So 0.2 moles of H2O formed.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57 kJ =11.4 kJ, so -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, wait, the units are mixed here. The answer options are in kcal and kJ. Option B is in kcal, D is in kJ.

Wait, so let's make sure about the units. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often expressed as about -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H2O formed). But sometimes it's given as -13.6 kcal/mol (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal).

Wait, let me compute this: 57 kJ is equal to 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. So each mole of H2O releases about 13.6 kcal.

So if 0.2 moles are formed, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. But wait, that would be option A. But wait, that seems conflicting
