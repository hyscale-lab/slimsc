Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me the desired compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents. Let's see: positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe it's positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are adjacent or meta to each other. Let me think.

The substituents are tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, wait, no, the numbering might be different. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So that would make them in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

But wait, in benzene, numbering starts to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are on adjacent positions, that's a 1,2,3 pattern, but I need to make sure that's the case.

So the target is a benzene ring with ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are in
