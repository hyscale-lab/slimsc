Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given, so I need to figure out what product 1 is.

First, thinking about the reaction of dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. When you heat it with KOH, which is a strong base, I think an elimination reaction happens. But wait, dibromides usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So heating with KOH (probably in ethanol or another suitable solvent) would lead to the formation of an alkene through an E2 mechanism.

But wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure. If the bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So product 1 is likely to be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, maybe it's a different structure. Actually, I'm not sure about the exact structure, but the key is that product 1 is an alkene.

Looking at the IR data: a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh wait, but elimination would form a double bond, which would show up around 1640 cm^-1, but that's not what's given here. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, another possibility: if two equivalents of KOH react with the dibromide, it could lead to a substitution reaction. But substitution in such a rigid structure might form something else. Wait, but dibromides with strong bases can also undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation or some kind of cyclization? No, that's usually for esters. Wait, but looking again, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. So how would that happen?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. Another thought: Maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, and when treated with a strong base like KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility is that KOH could cause the formation of a gem-diol, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR data. Product 1 has 1H NMR signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Let's think about what each signal might represent.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OH group, but wait, that's a high shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, because if it's a ketone, the hydrogen wouldn't be on the carbonyl. Maybe it's an alcohol. But the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is strong. That's consistent with a ketone (around 1715-1740 cm^-1) or maybe an ester (which is higher, around 1735-1765). But if it's a ketone, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) loses water to form a carbonyl. But wait, how does that fit here? I don't see diol formation. Maybe I need to think about this differently.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to an allene? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But with two bromines and excess KOH, maybe it's a double substitution. But substitution would give a diol, but that wouldn't produce a carbonyl.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Let me think again. Maybe the base induces a hydride shift? Or maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait a second, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on adjacent carbons, but in a rigid structure,
