Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read it again: We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what's happening in each step. Let's start by understanding the initial solution.

When we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with another 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). The concentration will change because of dilution. I remember the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me calculate that.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction equation is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present initially. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid before titration. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = M * V (in liters).

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait, no, wait. No: Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, after diluting with 20 cm³, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So, yes, that part was correct.

When titrated, the NaOH will react with this CH3COOH. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

Now, the problem asks about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

First, let's tackle the equivalence point, because that might be simpler.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution will consist of the sodium acetate (since Na+ is a spectator ion) dissolved in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic. Therefore, we'll need to calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be found by figuring out the total volume of solution.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at equivalence point? Let's calculate that. The moles of NaOH needed is equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the total volume of solution at equivalence is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The concentration of acetate ions is moles / volume in liters. Moles of acetate is 0.001, volume is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = 1e-14 = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that exactly. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, so the hydrolysis reaction doesn't produce a lot of OH^- ions. We can use the approximation.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x).
