Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here; maybe it's more about their compositions.

The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, assuming LTE. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si/Star_2]/[Si/Star_1] or maybe it's [Si_1/Si_2]... Wait, no, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in each, so perhaps [Si_1]/[Si_2] or [Si_2]/[Si_1]? Wait, no, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si_1]/[Si_2].

Wait, wait, actually, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be [Si in Star_1] divided by [Si in Star_2], right? Or maybe (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2), that's the ratio.

But how do I find that?

I remember that the abundance ratios are logarithmic, so each [X/Y] is log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y in the Sun), or wait, no. The definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) = log( (n_X/n_Y) * (n
