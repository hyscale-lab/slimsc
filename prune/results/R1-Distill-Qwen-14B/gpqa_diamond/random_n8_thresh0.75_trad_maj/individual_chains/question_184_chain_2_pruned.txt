Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize where each substituent is. The molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering the positions: position 1 is where the ethoxy is, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That means they are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement. Wait, no, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, the substituents are in ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

The challenge is to figure out the order of reactions to introduce these groups. Since benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, the order matters because each substituent directs incoming groups to specific positions.

Let me recall the directing effects of substituents. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. Ethoxy is also activating and ortho/para. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to meta positions. But the target molecule has nitro in position 3,
