Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and the splitting can give clues about the structure.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. Triplet usually means each proton is next to two neighboring protons, right? Like in a CH2CH3 group. And 6H suggests maybe two CH3 groups. Wait, if it's a triplet, maybe each of those CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. So perhaps it's two CH2CH3 groups. But wait, each CH3 would be a triplet if each is next to a CH2. But wait, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, maybe it's part of a longer chain. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Like, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, or maybe it's a cyclopropane ring or something. But no, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means four neighbors? Or maybe each of those protons is adjacent to two others, but that's more like a triplet. Wait, no, quartet (n+1 where n=3) implies each proton is next to three equivalent protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH2 structure. No, that would be a single bond. Let me think about common structures. The triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm is typical of two CH3 groups next to a CH2. Like maybe two ethyl groups. Or maybe it's part of a larger structure, like a cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, another approach: if the triplet is 6H, that's two sets of three H each. So probably two CH3 groups. Each CH3 is a triplet, meaning each is adjacent to a CH2 group. So the structure might be something like CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but how do the quartets come into play?

The quartet is 4H at 1.3 ppm. Quartet suggests that each of these protons is next to three equivalent
