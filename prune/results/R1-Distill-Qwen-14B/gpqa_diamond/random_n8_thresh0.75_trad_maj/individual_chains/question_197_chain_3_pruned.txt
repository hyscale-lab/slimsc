Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the final product is based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I should probably analyze the spectroscopic data to determine the structure of compound X. Then, I can think about what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI. 

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, so that might be O-H stretching. But wait, another possibility is an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3300. Or maybe it's an amine, but I don't see any peaks that suggest that. Wait, another thought: the 3400–2500 could be due to an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Also, maybe an alkyne, but the 2500 could be the C-H stretch for an alkyne.

Looking at the other IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. That makes me think of either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now, the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they can vary. Alternatively, it might be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe an acidic proton like in a phenol? But phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Hmm, wait, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the 10.5 seems a bit high for that. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid? But I'm not sure yet.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H),
