Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. Let me start by recalling what I know about Grubbs catalyst and the reactions it's involved in.

Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene complex, right? It's used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of substituents on either side of a double bond are exchanged. It can be ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. Oh wait, and since Grubbs is a first-generation catalyst, it's typically used for ring-closing metathesis and some cross metathesis but might not work well in all cases, especially with very substituted alkenes, but I'm not sure.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃? Wait, no. Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, let me count the carbons. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. No, wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, pent means five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene's structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be more than five carbons. Let me think again. Let's number from the double bond. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, where
