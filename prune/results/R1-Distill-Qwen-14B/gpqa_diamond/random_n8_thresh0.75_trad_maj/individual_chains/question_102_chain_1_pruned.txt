Alright, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Okay, the setup: They're studying a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular (so probably the part that binds ligand is extracellular). The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta actin, I think. It's a strong promoter used for transgenic expression. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites, which allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA, usually in a polycistronic construct. So the mRNA would have ligand and receptor ORFs, with the IRES between them. 

But wait, the question mentions loxP and lox2272 cassettes. The ligand ORF has a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So that means the ligand is flanked by loxP sites and a stop. Similarly, the receptor is flanked by lox2272. 

Oh right, the loxP sites are for Cre recombinase. Cre is an enzyme that recognizes loxP sites and excises the DNA between them. So when Cre is present, it will delete the stop cassette, allowing the ORF to be expressed.

So the construct is a bicistronic vector with ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, which is strong. The receptor is after IRES, which allows for its expression from the same mRNA. But both are flanked by stop cassettes with different lox sites. 

They then transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So presumably, they wanted to see expression of the ligand and receptor. But in the mouse model, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal (eGFP). 

Wait, why are they using SOX10-Cre? SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in the development of various cell lineages, including neural crest. Cre is a recombinase used to delete specific genes in a tissue-specific manner. So the construct must have a loxP site around the gene(s) of interest so that Cre can delete them or allow their expression.

In the mouse model, they're homozygous for the construct. When they cross with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, including probably the cells expressing the receptor and ligand.

So in the mouse, the construct would be under the control of the CBA promoter, but I'm a bit confused about how the SOX10-Cre
