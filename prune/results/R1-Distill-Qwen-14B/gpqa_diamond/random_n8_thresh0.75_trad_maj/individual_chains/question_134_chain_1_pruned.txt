Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from chemistry. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I think the typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, in this problem, it's not just one acid and one base; there are three different solutions involved. So I'll have to figure out all the reactions here.

The solutions given are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic, right? And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh, but wait, when you mix acids and bases, the neutralization reaction occurs between them. So I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions available in the mixture.

Wait, first, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Let me break it down.

First, HCl is a strong acid, so each molecule dissociates into one H+ and one Cl- ion. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters, and the concentration is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. So that gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Each molecule can donate two H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 liters, and concentration 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL or 0.2 liters, concentration 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, so the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. And OH- is 0.2 moles. Oh wait, but H+ is more than OH-? So the H+ will have some left over, and the OH- will all be neutralized.

Wait no, no, because in neutralization, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio.
