Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly. And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1/plx^something.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant star.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density in space is the same everywhere. That is, the same number of stars per cubic parsec, regardless of distance.

So imagine a sphere of radius d. The number of stars in that sphere would be proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)πd³. But wait, if the distribution is uniform, the number of stars N in a volume V is N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So a unit change in plx (like from plx to plx + dplx) would correspond to a certain range of distances.

Wait, maybe I should think about the range of distances that a particular change in parallax represents. Let's say we consider a small change in parallax, dplx. The corresponding change in distance would be from d to d + dd.

But wait, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So dd = (dplx)/(plx²). Because differentiating plx with respect to d gives dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - d² dplx. But since I'm considering positive ranges, maybe I should take absolute values, so dd = d
