Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and probability densities. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, wave functions usually are complex, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Oh, right, the i is the imaginary unit, so the wave function is a complex function. But for the purpose of finding the probability density, I remember that we take the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

The measurement results show that when we measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. Which means that the probability of finding a particle outside this region is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3, right? Or wait, no, because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for the region where the particle exists. But the problem states that when they measured, the particles were found only between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is non-zero within 1 to 3, I suppose? Or wait, maybe the given wave function is valid in the region where the particle can exist, so perhaps it's zero outside. But the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside, so that implies that the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. But the wave function provided is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which is complex. So perhaps this is the wave function in the region between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the problem says that the wave function is as given in a part of space where the particle can exist. So I think that in the region x<1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. But inside 1 to 3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the square of the absolute value is |ψ|^2 = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)², because the imaginary part is 0.5i. So ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, so the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5, so |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the square of a complex number ψ = A + Bi is |ψ|^2 = A^2 + B^2. So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So yes, |ψ|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized, right? Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So I need to compute the integral of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let me write that out. The integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Breaking this into two terms: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx + ∫0.25 dx.

The first integral is a² ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5. And this must equal 1 because the wave function is normalized.

So setting up the equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I can compute ln(2) approximately as 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. Option A is 1.1, which is larger. Option D is 0.6, which is smaller. Option C is 0.35, way too small.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), correct. So from x=1 to x=3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the first term is a² ln(2).

The second term is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5, as I had before.

So equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a = sqrt( (0.5)/(ln 2) )

Let me compute this more accurately. ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 divided by 0.69314718056 is approximately 0.72134752044.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.72134752) ≈ 0.8493.

Which is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \).

The wave function is normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. Therefore, we compute the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2), \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5. \)

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.8493.
\]

This value is closest to option **B) 0.85**. The other options are inconsistent with the calculated value.

Answer: B
