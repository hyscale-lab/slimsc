Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a typo? Because benzene rings are numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So 1-bromo and 2-d something? Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene with another substituent? Wait, I think I need to clarify the structure.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps the 'd' refers to a deuterium? Like, maybe it's a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Oh, but deuterium is similar to hydrogen. Wait, but the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? That's possible. So the structure is bromine at position 1, and a deuterium (a hydrogen isotope) at position 2.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' refers to a double bond, but that doesn't make much sense here. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene with a deuterium. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is bromobenzene with a methyl group at position 2. Wait, but the question says 2-d, which would be 2-deutero. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative where the bromine is at position 1, and there's a deuterium (so a hydrogen with a different isotope) at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, typically used in deprotonation reactions. Also, in aromatic substitution, especially under deprotonation conditions, it can lead to elimination or dehydrohalogenation, but more importantly, considering that the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent but also can act as a base.

Wait, bromobenzene is generally not very reactive towards elimination because it's a meta director, but maybe with a strong base like NaNH2, it could lead to an elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in aromatic compounds, that would form a triple bond or a diene? Not sure. Wait, but benzene is already aromatic, so perhaps we're talking about forming a ring with more unsaturation, but that's not possible since benzene is fully unsaturated.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination where H and Br are removed, and a double bond is formed. So, the H and Br are on adjacent positions, so when they're removed, a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So, for example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, then when we eliminate HBr (but wait, in this case, it's a D and Br?), then we would form a double bond between C1 and C2, creating a 1,2-didehydrobenzene structure. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is a hydrogen, and the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in benzene, if we remove H and Br from adjacent positions, we could form a double bond. So for example, in 1-bromo-2-hydrogen benzene, the base would abstract the H from position 2, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between 1 and 2, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it a 1,2-didehydrobenzene or similar structure.

Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds. Adding another double bond in a position adjacent would perhaps lead to a diene structure, but in a ring, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming a styrenelike structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. But wait, that's not possible with a single eliminationâ€”more likely a double bond.

Wait, wait, but let me think about the structure again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, then when treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), the base would abstract a proton (deutero is just a regular H in terms of acidity, so maybe it's abstracted). So, the D at position 2 is abstracted, leading to a carbanion at position 2, and the Br leaves as Br-.

Wait, but wait, in aromatic compounds, the mechanism for elimination is perhaps different. So if NaNH2 is a strong base, it can abstract an acidic proton. In this case, the deuterium (D) at position 2 is probably less acidic than regular H, but for the sake of reaction, let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (D) from position 2, and then the bromide leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, making it a 1,2-didehydro derivative.

Wait, but benzene has all single bonds, but with conjugated double bonds. If I form a double bond between C1 and C2, that might disrupt the aromaticity, but perhaps it's a conjugated diene. Or maybe it's a case of forming a triple bond, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type alkylation, but I don't think so because NaNH2 isn't a Lewis acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about forming a benzene ring with a dehydrohalogenation product, creating a triple bond. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a case of elimination where the Br and D (from position 2) are removed, forming a double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it a 1,2-didehydrobenzene, which is also known as a cyclohexadienyl cation? Wait, not sure.

Wait, but benzene is aromatic, so any elimination would have to maintain aromaticity. So maybe the product is a ring with a triple bond or an aromatic system with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. The structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, the base could abstract the D from position 2, leading to a deprotonation. Then, the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds. If we form a double bond between C1 and C2, that would disrupt the conjugation. So perhaps this isn't possible, and instead, the product would be a ring with a triple bond, but that's even less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But in that case, what's the nucleophile? In a substitution reaction with NaNH2, perhaps the NH2^- is the nucleophile. But aromatic substitution typically requires activation, like a nitration or similar. Bromobenzene is deactivated, so SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) usually requires strong activating groups, which aren't present here.

Wait, but if the ring is activated, maybe in some way, but in 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the D at position 2 is just a methyl group? No, wait, the question says 2-d, so perhaps it's a deuterium, not a methyl. So, no, it's just a hydrogen isotope.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a benzidine-type elimination, where H and Br are eliminated to form a triple bond, but I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but NaNH2 is more commonly used in dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, maybe I should think about what NaNH2 does. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation, especially in aliphatic compounds. For example, in the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides via E2 mechanisms.

But in aromatic systems, elimination might be a bit different. So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, perhaps the base removes the D (as a proton), and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, in benzene, all carbons are sp2 hybridized, so a double bond between two adjacent carbons would require a different structure.

Wait, but benzene has a delocalized pi system, so adding another double bond would require some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cycloheptatriene or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products. If the reaction is elimination, the major product would be the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be 1,2-didehydrobenzene, but I'm not sure what that structure would look like.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but that seems very unlikely with such reagents.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but in this case, the ring is only substituted with Br and a D (which is an electron-donating group, similar to H). So, perhaps the ring isn't activated enough for SNAr to occur. Plus, NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile in this context.

Wait, but in some cases, under strong basic conditions, elimination is favored. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it a 1,2-didehydrobenzene. But I'm not sure if that's a stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking, and the product is something else. Maybe the base abstracts a proton from a different position, leading to different products.

Wait, but the starting material has bromine at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (since in benzene, position 1 has neighbors 2 and 6). So, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, that's adjacent to Br. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2.

But wait, benzene already has double bonds. So, perhaps the product is a ring with three double bonds, but that's not possible because benzene already has three. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a cyclohexadienyl anion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a triple bond. If the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, then perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But how would that work? Triple bonds in aromatic compounds are rare, but maybe in this case, it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a CH group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products and their structures. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and the reaction is with NaNH2, then perhaps the main product is the elimination product, which would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it 1,2-didehydrobenzene.

But wait, can benzene rings form such structures? I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring expansion or other structural changes, but I don't have enough knowledge about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as a substitution. For substitution, perhaps the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile, but SNAr requires a good leaving group and an electron-deficient ring. The ring here has Br, which is a leaving group, but without activating groups, it might not proceed easily.

Wait, but in some cases, especially with strong bases, elimination is favored over substitution. So, perhaps the main product is the elimination product, which forms a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding 1,2-didehydrobenzene.

But I'm not certain about the structure or the number of possible products. Let's think about the possible products in terms of their positions. If the elimination occurs between C1 and C2, that's one product. Alternatively, could elimination occur in another position if the starting material has more than one possibility?

Wait, wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the Br is at position 1, D at position 2. So, if the base abstracts the D, which is at position 2, adjacent to Br, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. But maybe there's another possibility if the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, but in this structure, the only other Hs are at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base and would abstract the most acidic protons available. In this case, the D is a proton in the molecule. Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than protium? Or is it the other way around? Wait, actually, deuterium is slightly less acidic than protium because the bond strength is higher. So, in this case, the D at position 2 is less acidic than regular Hs. So, perhaps the base would abstract a proton from another position, say position 3 or 4.

Wait, but if the base can't abstract the D (due to lower acidity), then it would abstract a proton from a more acidic position. Where would that be? In aromatic rings, the acidity of protons can be influenced by substituents. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the acidity of adjacent protons.

Wait, but in bromobenzene, the protons ortho to bromine are more acidic because the adjacent Br withdraws electron density via the inductive effect, making the proton more polarized and thus more acidic.

So, in our starting material, the Br is at position 1. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to Br, and thus more acidic. But in this case, position 2 has a D, which is a deuterium. So, the H at position 6 would be more acidic, perhaps.

Wait, but position 2 has D, which is less acidic than H. So, maybe the base would abstract a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br, making it more acidic. So, the base abstracts H from position 6, and the Br at position 1 leaves, forming a double bond between position 1 and 6.

Wait, but how? Let me visualize the benzene ring. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and position 6 is H. So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br at position 1 and the H at position 6 are on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 6 are adjacent on the benzene ring). So, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, leading to a 1,6-didehydrobenzene structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts H from position 3 or 4, but those are meta or para to Br. The meta position (position 3) is less acidic than the ortho positions. So, more likely the base would abstract H from position 6.

So, in that case, the elimination would lead to a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but that's the same as between C1 and C2, because the ring is symmetrical. Wait no, because the ring is symmetric, but the substituents are in different positions.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's number the benzene ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and positions 3,4,5,6 have H. So, the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1) because in the benzene ring, position 1 is connected to position 2 and 6.

So, eliminating Br and H from position 6 would form a double bond between 1 and 6, which is the same as forming a double bond between 1 and 2 because of the ring's symmetry. Wait, no, because position 2 is deuterium and position 6 is H.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the numbering. Maybe the positions are arranged such that position 2 is adjacent to position 1, and position 6 is also adjacent to position 1. So, if the base abstracts H from position 2 (D) or position 6 (H), elimination could occur from either.

But wait, the D at position 2 is less acidic than H at position 6. So, the base would preferentially abstract the H from position 6. So, elimination would occur between position 1 (Br) and position 6 (H), forming a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the ring is symmetric, perhaps that's the same as the product from elimination between C1 and C2.

Wait, no, because the starting material has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, which is different from C1 and C2.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 1 and 6 are also adjacent. So, if elimination occurs between 1 and 2, we get a double bond there, and if it occurs between 1 and 6, another double bond.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the D is at position 2. The H at position 6 is more acidic than the D, so the base (NaNH2) would abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination between C1 and C6, forming a double bond there.

So that would be one product.

Alternatively, could the base abstract the D from position 2, leading to elimination between C1 and C2, forming a double bond there? But D is less acidic than H, so the base would prefer the H from position 6.

Hmm, but in the starting material, position 2 has a D. The acidity of D compared to H: I think deuterium is slightly less acidic than protium because the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond. So the H at position 6 would be more acidic and thus more likely to be abstracted by the base.

So, the main product would be elimination between C1 and C6, forming a double bond there. But wait, what about position 3? The H at position 3 is meta to Br. Would that be acidic enough?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to multiple products depending on where the base abstracts the proton.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. The H at position 6 is ortho to Br, so it's more acidic than the H at position 3 (meta), which is less acidic. So, the base would abstract the H from position 6, leading to elimination between C1 and C6, forming a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but leads to a ring contraction or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a CH2 group. Wait, but how? I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products in terms of the number. The question is multiple-choice, with options 1,2,3,4. So, if the reaction produces only one product, the answer is B)1. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the starting material is symmetric, and regardless of where the elimination occurs, the product is the same. But wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, which is not symmetric, then elimination at position 2 (D) or position 6 (H) would give different products.

Wait, but the D is at position 2, and the H at position 6 is ortho to Br. So, elimination would occur at position 6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that's one possible product. However, since the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the ring isn't symmetric. So, the products from eliminating at C1-C6 and C1-C2 would be different, but in this case, the base would abstract the more acidic H at position 6, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract the D at position 2, but since it's less acidic, it's less likely, so the major product is elimination at C1-C6.

Wait, but maybe the reaction can abstract D as well, leading to a different product. If the base abstracts D, then elimination would occur between C1 and C2, leading to a double bond there. But since D is less acidic, this would be a minor product, but perhaps under strong base conditions, it's possible.

So, if both positions are possible, we could get two products: one with double bond between C1-C2 and another between C1-C6.

Wait, but wait, in benzene, the ring is symmetric, so the product from C1-C2 would be the same as from C1-C6 in terms of structure, but in our starting material, positions 2 and 6 are different (one has D, the other H). So, the products would be different.

Wait, no, because the starting material has Br at position 1, D at 2, and H at 6. So, eliminating between C1 and C2 (D) would give a different structure than eliminating between C1 and C6 (H). So, perhaps two different products are possible, depending on where the base abstracts the proton.

But wait, the base prefers to abstract the more acidic H. Since the H at position 6 is ortho to Br, it's more acidic than the D, so the base would abstract that. So, only elimination between C1 and C6 would occur, leading to one product.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as an E2 elimination but as a substitution. But earlier I thought substitution isn't likely here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but I'm not sure how that would form.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so with NaNH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But in that case, how many possible products are there?

Wait, considering the starting material has Br at position 1 and D at 2, and the H at 6 is ortho to Br, which is more acidic. So, elimination would occur between C1 and C6, leading to a double bond there. But then, how would that affect the structure?

Wait, perhaps the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, making a 1,6-didehydrobenzene, which is the same as a 1,2-didehydrobenzene because of the ring's symmetry. But no, the positions are different in terms of substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the product would be a dieneyl benzene or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to only one product (the starting material), but that's not one of the options. Because the options include B)1, which would mean the reaction produces one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible elimination products. Elimination at C1 and C2 (D) would lead to a double bond there, and elimination at C1 and C6 (H) would lead to another. But since the H is more acidic, only the latter is major, so one product.

Wait, but maybe elimination can occur at either position, leading to two different products. So, the number of possible products would be two.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling of two benzene rings, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but NaNH2 isn't typically used for that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the reaction produces one product. So, the answer would be B)1. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

If the base abstracts the D from position 2, perhaps the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But since D is less acidic, this might not be the main pathway.

If the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.

So, two possible products: one with double bond between C1-C2 and another between C1-C6. But because the starting material has D at C2 and H at C6, these would be different products. So, two products.

But wait, in benzene, the positions are cyclic, so perhaps the double bonds are equivalent. No, because in the starting material, the substituents are different.

Wait, for example, if the product has a double bond between C1 and C2, and another product between C1 and C6, these would be distinct products because the substituents adjacent would differ.

Wait, but considering the numbering, perhaps the products are the same due to symmetry. Let me visualize:

If the product from C1-C2 is a ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and the product from C1-C6 is a double bond between 1 and 6, but in a benzene ring, these are equivalent via rotation. So, perhaps these are the same product.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents (Br at 1, D at 2, H at 6) are arranged in a fixed way. So, forming a double bond between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6 would lead to different structures because the substituents around are different.

Wait, but in reality, in a benzene ring, the structure is symmetric, so perhaps the products are the same regardless of where the elimination occurs. So, the product would be the same whether the double bond is between 1-2 or 1-6, making it just one product.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a double bond between 1-2 and another between 1-6, but due to the ring's symmetry, these are the same structure. So, only one product.

Wait, but the substituents are different. For example, if the double bond is between 1-2, the adjacent substituents are D (position 2) and nothing else. If between 1-6, the substituent is H (position 6). So, the products would be different.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I need to make a decision.

Considering that the starting material has Br at 1, D at 2, and H at 6. The base would abstract the more acidic H at 6, leading to elimination between 1 and 6, forming a double bond there. So, one product.

Alternatively, if the base can abstract D from position 2, leading to elimination between 1 and 2, forming another product. So, two products.

But since D is less acidic than H, the major product is the one from position 6. But perhaps the reaction conditions are such that both positions are possible, leading to two products.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so it can abstract both D and H, but which is more favorable.

In any case, the possible number of products would be determined by how many unique positions can lead to elimination. If the base can abstract from positions 2 and 6, leading to two different products, then the answer would be C)2.

Alternatively, perhaps only one product is formed because the base abstracts from position 6, leading to one product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: think about the possible products of dehydrohalogenation of bromobenzene. Wait, I think I've read that benzene rings undergo elimination under strong base conditions to form rings with double bonds. But the number of possible products depends on the structure.

In this case, the starting material has substituents in positions 1 and 2. So, elimination can occur between 1 and 2 (if D is abstracted) or between 1 and 6 (if H is abstracted), leading to two different products. So, two possible products.

Therefore, the number of organic products is 2.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base, and the reaction likely proceeds via an elimination mechanism, where a proton (or deuterium) is abstracted, and the bromine atom leaves, forming a double bond. 

The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. The protons at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are also present. Among these, the protons ortho to the bromine (positions 2 and 6) are more acidic due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of bromine. However, the deuterium at position 2 is less acidic than the protium at position 6 because the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond. 

Thus, the base (NaNHâ‚‚) is more likely to abstract the proton at position 6, leading to elimination between positions 1 and 6, forming a double bond there. However, if the base abstracts the deuterium at position 2 (less likely due to its lower acidity), elimination between positions 1 and 2 would occur, forming a double bond there. 

The two possible elimination products correspond to double bonds between positions 1-6 and 1-2. These products are distinct because the substituents adjacent to the double bonds differ (deuterium at position 2 versus hydrogen at position 6). Therefore, two unique organic products are formed in this reaction.

Answer: C
