Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Hmm. Let's see. Okay, the problem says that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, no. Actually, in quantum mechanics, the wave function itself doesn't have to be zero outside a region; it's the probability density that matters. Oh, but wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But the question says that when measuring, none were found at x < 1 and x >3. So that implies that the probability of finding the particle outside 1 and 3 is zero. So, the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3. But the given wave function doesn't look like it's zero outside that range. Hmm, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's the expression for the wave function in the region where the particle can exist. Oh, so the wave function is zero outside of x between 1 and 3. So the given expression is valid only for 1 <= x <=3,
