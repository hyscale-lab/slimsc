Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, Pz. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, the state vector is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. That might make things easier because, in that basis, the expectation value of Pz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The state is given as a column vector, so it's already in the Pz eigenbasis. Each component corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates |n> of Pz, where n is for each diagonal entry.

Looking at the matrix of Pz, it's a 3x3 diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ (for first basis vector), 0 (second), and -ħ (third). So the basis vectors are |1>, |2>, |3>, with eigenvalues +ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

The given state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares should be 1.

Calculating the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) =
