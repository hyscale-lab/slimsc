Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The problem asks me to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by elements Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

So the operator matrix is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. The elements are such that A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each element is hbar/2 instead of 1. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but wait—actually, the Pauli matrices are defined with 1s, so if A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], that's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator A as well, right? Because A is a multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A should be the same as those of σ_x. So I need to find the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Wait, no. Let me think. For σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenstate for +1 is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and for -1 it's (|up> - |down>)/√2, I think. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, actually, σ_x |+x> = |+x>, and |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2, right? Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and |+x> and |-x> are the corresponding eigenstates.

So the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of σ_x, just scaled by hbar/2. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, the problem says the operator's matrix has Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j. So in matrix form, A is:

[ 0      (hbar/2) ]
[ (hbar/2)  0 ]

So that's exactly (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Wait, but wait. The question says the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because it's proportional, but not necessarily normalized.

So let's compute the state |alpha>. Let me represent |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1) in the computational basis. So |alpha> is proportional to (1+i, 2 - i). Let me write it as a vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T * normalization constant.

Wait, but since it's proportional, the normalization constant can be found by dividing by the norm. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Compute each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = 1/sqrt(7) * ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> )

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Expressed as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Alternatively, we can write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So let's substitute these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) * (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) * (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) ] * [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expanding the terms inside the brackets:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> ) + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ) ]

Combine the coefficients for |+x> and |-x>:

For |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 +2 + i -i =3.

For |-x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So:

= [ 3|+x> + (-1 +2i)|-x> ] * [ 1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) ]

So |alpha> = [3|+x> + (-1+2i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Because sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14).

Now, the expansion coefficients for |+x> and |-x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

The probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient for |+x>:

|3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |^2.

Compute the numerator's magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4 =5. So (5)/14 ≈ 0.357142...

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Wait, but wait, the options have 0.64, 0.36, etc. Let me check the sum: 9/14
