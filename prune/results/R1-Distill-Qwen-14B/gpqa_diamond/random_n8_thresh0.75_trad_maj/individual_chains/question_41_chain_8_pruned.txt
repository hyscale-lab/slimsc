Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, right, the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by the index of refraction. Oh wait, but in this case, the medium is moving. So does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light observed?

I remember something about Galilean relativity. In a frame moving relative to a medium, the speed of light might not just be straightforward. Oh wait, but wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, according to Einstein, but this is a medium, so maybe it's different.

Let me think. In the glass, the speed of light is v_glass = c / n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So how does that combine?

Wait, if the glass is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed in the glass plus the glass's movement? Or is it more complicated than that because light is an electromagnetic wave and the medium's motion might affect the propagation.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So perhaps we can model this using the velocity addition formula from classical mechanics, but I'm not sure if that applies here
