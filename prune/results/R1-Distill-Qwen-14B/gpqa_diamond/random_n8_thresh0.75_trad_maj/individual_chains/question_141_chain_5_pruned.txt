Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

First, let me draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene ring with substituents. The numbering might be a bit confusing. Oh wait, 1-bromo-2-d... Wait, that's maybe 1-bromo-benzene-2-dimethylamino? Or is the "2-d" part something else? Oh wait, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe it's 2-dimethylamino? Or perhaps it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene? Or maybe 2-d is something else. Wait, maybe the compound is 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene. Because the substituents are at positions 1 and 2.

Wait, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps the "d" stands
