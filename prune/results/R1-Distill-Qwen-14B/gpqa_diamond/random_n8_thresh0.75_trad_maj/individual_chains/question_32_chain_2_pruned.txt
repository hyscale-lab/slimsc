Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. I need to find the energy, and the options are given in GeV.

Wait, first, I should probably figure out what nucleus X is. Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium usually has an atomic number of 3. So normally, Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy as the energy in these contexts. Hmm, I need to be careful. Let's think about the formulas.

The total energy E of a particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So if speed v is 0.96c, then v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, let me compute it more precisely. Let me do the square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so
