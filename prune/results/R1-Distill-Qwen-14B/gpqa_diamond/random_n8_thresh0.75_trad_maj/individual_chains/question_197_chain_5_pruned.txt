Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Sometimes these problems can be a bit tricky, especially when you're just starting out, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I think that's a reaction to eliminate something, maybe like a Hoffman elimination or something else involving elimination. Wait, oh right! When alcohols react with HI and red phosphorus, it's typically for the elimination of water, leading to an alkene. But wait, wait—I'm getting a bit confused. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for elimination reactions. Oh wait, perhaps it's the treatment for an alcohol to form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

But first, let's figure out what compound X is. The IR and NMR data are given, so I'll need to analyze those to figure out the structure of X.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which suggests an O-H stretch. Wait, but that region is also where alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids absorb. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. Then there
