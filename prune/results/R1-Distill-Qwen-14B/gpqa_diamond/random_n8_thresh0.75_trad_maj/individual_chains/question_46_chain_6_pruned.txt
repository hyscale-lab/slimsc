Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking it down.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming of double bonds, right? So, what happens when Grubbs catalyst is applied to an alkene?

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene—the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch at C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Let me draw this out.

Pentane has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Hmm, no, that doesn't quite add up. Let's count: the main chain is five carbons long, with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. Then, position 3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the molecule is racemic, meaning it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, wait a minute—can 3-methylpent-1-ene have enantiomers? Because for a molecule to have enantiomers, it must have a chiral center. Let me check: the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The central carbon (C3) is connected to: a CH2CH3, a CH2 group (from the double bond), a methyl group, and another CH2 (from the double bond). Wait, so the central carbon (C3) is CH(CH3). So, attached to C3
