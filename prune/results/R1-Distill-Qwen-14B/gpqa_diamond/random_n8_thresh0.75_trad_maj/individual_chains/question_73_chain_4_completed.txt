Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics because the speeds add differently. Oh right, relativistic addition of velocities. So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. That would be the case in classical physics, but relativity must have a different approach.

So, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, I think I might have that reversed. Let me think—both are moving in the same direction. So if one is faster than the other, the relative speed is the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So u is the speed of the first astronaut, and v is the speed of the second. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the relative speed part is either C or D.

Now for the total energy. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each's energy is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but each has a different mass.

Wait, the first astronaut has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. The second is 3m at 0.5c. So each energy is gamma * m_total * c².

So for the first, gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/(c^2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) → sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25.

So energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, their rest mass is 2m. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c².

Gamma1 is 1.25, so E1 would be 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) → sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866, so gamma is approx 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3 m c². Let me calculate that. 1.1547 *3 is about 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = approximately 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c², and option D says E=5 m c². So that would make option C the correct one for energy.

Wait, but let me double-check the gamma calculations because sometimes I might mix up the velocities.

Gamma for 0.6c: (1 - 0.36)^-0.5 = (0.64)^-0.5 = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct.

Gamma for 0.5c: (1 -0.25)^-0.5 = (0.75)^-0.5 = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547. Correct.

So E1 is 2.5, E2 is about 3.464, sum to 5.964. So approximately 5.96 m c², which is option C.

So the relative speed is ~0.14c, and energy ~5.96 m c². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c \), \( E = mc^2 \) — Incorrect. The relative speed is not \( 1.1c \), and the total energy is much larger than \( mc^2 \).
- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c \), \( E = 4.96mc^2 \) — Incorrect. The relative speed is not \( 0.1c \), and the total energy does not match.
- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \) — Correct. The relative speed and total energy match the calculations.
- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5mc^2 \) — Incorrect. The total energy is slightly underestimated.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
