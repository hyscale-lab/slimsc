Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an -OH stretch or an N-H stretch, but since there's no amine info, maybe it's an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300, which fits the first IR region. But wait, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1. 1720 might be an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak around that region. Oh wait, but the integration is 1H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid with one proton, like a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. Let me think.

The rest of the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The coupling suggests that each proton is next to one substituent. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group on one side and something else on the other.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That seems like a chain attached to the benzene. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to something with two protons. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group. Wait, 1.4 (d,3H) suggests a CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me think: maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like a carbonyl group and a chain attached, like a propyl group or something.

Wait, putting this together. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or ketone. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR could be a carboxylic acid proton if it's a singlet, but if it's a broad peak, that fits a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde
