Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me go through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric means that the molar ratio between calcium and EDTA is 1:1? Yeah, because EDTA usually binds one metal ion, so each Ca is paired with one EDTA molecule. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its active form, so it can fully complex the calcium. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, which probably isn't too relevant here except for maybe some constants, but the K is given, so maybe it's not needed.

The dissociation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. I think K here refers to the formation constant of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- form the complex. The reaction would look something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, then under ideal conditions, the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the K is 5e10, which is a large number, so the complex is very stable. That would mean that the extent of dissociation is very low.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the complex concentration as [CaEDTA]. Let's say that it dissociates a little bit, with a dissociation constant Kd, which is 1/Kf. Wait, no. Kf is formation constant, so Kd = 1/Kf is the dissociation constant. Because for the dissociation, the reverse reaction: CaEDTA ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. The Kd would be [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA].

Since Kf is 5e10, Kd is 1/(5e10
