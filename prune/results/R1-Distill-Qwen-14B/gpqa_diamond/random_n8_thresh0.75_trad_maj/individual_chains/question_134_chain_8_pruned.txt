Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Typically, it's around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I'm not sure about the exact value here.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the concentrations and volumes.

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving one H+ per molecule, right?

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, but I think when it's in dilute solutions, it only dissociates the first H+ completely. So each mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ in the first dissociation, and the second H+ is weak, but maybe for neutralization, we can consider both as available? Or wait, in neutralization reactions, the acid donates H+ ions. So H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, so each mole gives two H+? Wait, no. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, so it donates two H+? Or just one? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, in the first step, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2−. No, wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2−? Or is it only the first H+ that dissociates completely, and the second is a weak acid? Oh wait, I think the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2−?)—no, wait, no. Wait, actually, concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but in dilute solutions, the second H+ doesn't dissociate completely. So in this case, since it's 0.3 M, which is not very concentrated, I think only the first H+ dissociates completely. Wait no, that's not right. Let me think again. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first H+; the second H+ is a weak acid. So in solution, H2SO4 dissociates completely into H+ and HSO4^- first. Then, HSO4^- can dissociate further into H+ and SO4^2- but not completely. So in a 0.3 M solution, H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2−? Or only one H+ is fully released, so 0.3 M H2SO4 gives 0.3 M H+? Wait, no, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, so each mole gives two H+ ions? Or wait, no—each mole gives two H+ in the first dissociation. So for H2SO4, moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. But since it's diprotic and the first dissociation is complete, each mole contributes two H+ ions? Or wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation releases two H+ ions. So H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would produce 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation. So it completely dissociates into H+ and HSO4^- (which is a weak acid). So each mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ in the first
