Okay, so I have this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to stars. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Wait, so they want the number density in terms of parallax. Let me think about this.

Stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, but that probably means their density in space is uniform. So the same number density of stars in every direction. But wait, when we look at the parallax, which depends on distance, how does that affect the count?

I think I need to model this. Let's say the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is what we're trying to find. Since parallax is 1/d, higher parallax means closer stars.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. So the number in a volume element depends on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Volume in 3D space is proportional to the cube of the distance. Wait, let's see. For a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. Because the surface area is 4πd², and multiplied by thickness gives volume.

Now, since parallax plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So d = 1/plx, then dd is -d(plx)/dplx. Let me compute that derivative. Since d = 1/plx, dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But I'm dealing with absolute numbers, so maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now.

So, the volume element is 4πd² dd. Substituting d=1/plx, d² = 1/(plx²), and dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The volume element is 4π d² dd. But d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx^2). And since dd is (d dplx) (but with a negative sign), but for the sake of counting stars, we take the absolute value. So dd = (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So substitution:

4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume element is proportional to the volume, since the number density is uniform. So the number of stars per dplx is proportional to 1/(plx^4) multiplied by dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). 

Wait, but the question says "per unit range of parallax". So maybe it's the number per unit plx. So if you consider a small range dplx, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/(plx^4) * dplx. So the number per unit plx (i.e., the density) is 1/(plx^4). 

Wait, but that doesn't feel quite right. Let me think again. Stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. So the number in a shell between d
