Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein, but it's not working as expected. They introduced a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the plasmid and are having trouble expressing the protein.

The problem is that the plus strand sequence they provided doesn't produce the overexpressed protein. So, I need to look for possible reasons why this might be happening.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag isn't correct, possibly preventing purification. But the question is about overexpression. Maybe if the HA tag is messed up, it doesn't interfere with translation but might affect purification. Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a stop codon is present somewhere in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein. But the construct is designed for overexpression, so perhaps a mutation introduced a premature stop.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is added without a linker, maybe the protein is being degraded. But I'm not sure how the construct's sequence would show that. Alternatively, maybe the way the tag is added creates a site for proteolysis.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon in most organisms, including mammals. If the construct has a UAA that's not a stop, but the plasmid is in mammalian cells, that could be a problem. But UAA is a stop in mammalian cells, so if the plasmid has a UAA in the middle, the ribosome would stop there, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, looking at the provided sequence. Let me check for stop codons. The sequence is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to it. The coding strand is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA is same as the coding strand (except T becomes U).

So the mRNA would be the same sequence but with U instead of T. So looking at the end of the sequence: the last part is TGA. TGA is a stop codon. Wait, let me find the exact end.

Looking at the end of the given plus strand:

...TTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon would be TGA, which is a stop. Wait, so the last three nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA.

So in the mRNA, the last codon before the polyA tail would be UAA, which is a stop. So that's normal. But wait, the construct is for overexpression. If the construct's coding sequence ends with a stop codon, that's usual. So why would the protein not be expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a stop codon before the intended end would cause early termination.

Wait, looking through the sequence, maybe there's another stop codon earlier. Let me scan the sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets.

Looking through:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding strand.

First part: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCg...

Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is start. Then TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, GTT is Val, CCA is Pro, GAT (as before) TAC is Tyr again.

Wait, at position from the start: Let's check each triplet.

Looking for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking after ATG:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...

Wait, the sequence after the initial part: ...TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...

So the triplet here is AAA, followed by TGA. So the codons are:

AAA (Lys), TGA (stop), CTC (Leu), TGG (Trp), etc.

So after the AAA comes TGA, which is a stop codon. So that would cause translation to terminate early. So the mRNA would have a stop codon after Lys (AAA), then TGA.

That would mean the protein would be much shorter than expected. So in the construct, the coding sequence introduces a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle, leading to a truncated protein. Therefore, the protein isn't overexpressed because the ribosome stops early.

So looking back at the options, Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the stop codon is in the frame, but perhaps the reading frame changes? No, because the construct is the coding sequence, so the frame is maintained.

Wait, but the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus, which is added via genetic engineering. If the HA tag is correctly added, and the rest of the coding sequence is intact, but the TGA is present, that would cause early termination.

So the mistake is that during the construct's design, a stop codon (TGA) was introduced in the middle.

So why would that happen? Because perhaps the person inserted the HA tag in a way that caused a frame shift, introducing a stop. Or perhaps the original cloning introduced an unintended stop.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the first codon should be the HA tag. Let me check the start of the sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (Met). Then TAC (Tyr), which would be the second amino acid. So the HA tag is probably correctly added, but perhaps the HA tag's sequence had an in-frame stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is part of the coding sequence, and the TGA is within the HA or the GADD45G.

Wait, in the provided sequence, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the initial part is the HA, followed by GADD45G.

But perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon. Or, perhaps the person made a mistake in inserting the HA tag, leading to a stop codon.

In the given sequence, after the start codon ATG, the next codon is TAC, which is Tyr. So HA tag's sequence is correctly being translated. But then, after some codons, there's a TGA stop codon. That would cause the protein to terminate early.

So, why is there a TGA in the middle? Let's see: the sequence from the beginning:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... 

So the first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). So the HA tag is probably the first few codons, but then the next part is part of GADD45G. But the presence of TGA in the coding sequence would cause translation to stop after Lys. So the resulting protein would be only up to that point, not the full length.

So the problem is that the construct has an in-frame stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence, causing early termination.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be correct because of the premature stop codon.

Alternatively, option C says the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA tag is not linked properly, maybe the protein is degraded. But the presence of a premature stop codon would prevent the protein from being made in the first place, whereas proteolysis would occur after synthesis.

So the issue is due to a premature stop codon, which is option B.


The question involves a failed attempt to overexpress the GADD45G protein in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a coding sequence for GADD45G with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. Despite efforts, the protein is not overexpressed, and the provided sequence of the plus strand reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence. This stop codon occurs in the middle of the sequence, leading to early termination of translation and a truncated protein.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence would affect purification but not necessarily prevent translation. Since the issue is with overexpression, this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **Option B:** The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein. This aligns with the observed failure to overexpress the full-length protein.
- **Option C:** A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, but this would occur after translation. The issue here is the absence of full-length protein synthesis, which points to a problem with translation termination rather than degradation.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is not plausible because UAA is a standard stop codon in mammalian cells, and its presence would naturally halt translation.

The most likely explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein.
