Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's see. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, O could be from an aldehyde or maybe an alcohol or something else. Let me think about the NMR data first.

The 1H-NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. A triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, why is it a triplet? Oh, maybe coupling with two adjacent protons. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and split into doublets if adjacent to a CH2. Or maybe it's a conjugated system, like in a compound with an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Hmm.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H), 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The fact that there are two doublets each integrating to 2H suggests maybe two para-substituted aromatic rings. Like two phenyl groups, each with substituents in the para position. So if each ring has two substituents, perhaps at positions 4 and 4? Or wait, maybe each ring has a substituent in the para position, and the protons are the two adjacent to that. Alternatively, maybe each ring is part of a di-substituted benzene, like two substituents in para positions.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are each a doublet of two protons. So maybe like a di-substituted phenyl group, where each substituent is in the para position. But wait, more accurately, perhaps two substituents on each benzene ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's two monosubstituted benzene rings, each with a substituent in the para position, leading to two doublets each of 2H.

Then, 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an acidic proton. Aldehyde adjacent to an -OH group? Or maybe an alpha proton to an -OH or something. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated diene or something else. Wait, but 6.27 for 2H, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen? Or perhaps two protons on a substituent that's near an electronegative atom, like an oxygen.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. This is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2CH2 group or something like that. Alternatively, it could be part of an ether or an ester, but in this molecular formula, given the O and N, maybe a nitro group or amine elsewhere.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings/bonds, like maybe two rings and some double bonds.

Hmm. So possible structures: maybe two aromatic rings (each benzene is 3 degrees, so two would be 6, but that's more than 5. Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, 1 O.

Degree of unsaturation: Each double bond or ring is one. So for C8H9NO:

Hydrogens for a fully saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) would be 2*8 +2 = 18 H. But this has 9, so 9 missing. Each degree of unsaturation accounts for 2 H. So (18 -9)/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be. Hmm, did I do that right?

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, for C8H9NO:

(2*8 +2 - 9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees. So that could be:

- one ring (1) + four double bonds (4) → but that's too high. Alternatively,

- two rings (2) and three double bonds → 5. Or maybe one ring and four double bonds. Wait, more likely, maybe a combination of rings and double bonds.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe a di-substituted benzene ring with an aldehyde group and an amino group attached? Hmm, but the NMR has an aldehyde peak.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: the triplet at 9.72 ppm (aldehyde) and a broad singlet at 6.27 (possibly an alpha proton next to an alcohol or
