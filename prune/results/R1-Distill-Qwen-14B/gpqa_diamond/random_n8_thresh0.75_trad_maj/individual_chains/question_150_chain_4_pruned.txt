Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after a series of reactions, we need to determine the final product. The options are four different aldehydes or related compounds.

First, I should interpret the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. For a formula, the general formula is CnH2n+2Ox. Wait, but here, we have N as well. Let's adjust.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. To calculate degrees of unsaturation (DoU), each double bond or ring counts as 1, each triple bond as 2, etc. The formula for DoU is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the formula is DoU = (2*C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so it's (2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in: C=8, H=9, X=0 (no halogens), N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees of unsaturation.

Five degrees: that could be five rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) and a double bond or ring elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That region is typically for aldehydic protons (RCHO, around 9-10 ppm). But wait, a triplet? Aldehydes are usually split if there's coupling, but more often they're singlets because the aldehyde proton doesn't have adjacent protons. Unless it's part of a conjugated system. Hmm. Maybe it's a phenolic proton, but phenol
