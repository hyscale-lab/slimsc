Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is (i/2) times the commutator of the gamma matrices, [γ_mu, γ_nu]. But wait, the specific form of σ might not be too important for the dimension analysis here.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. From what I recall, a renormalizable theory requires all the coupling constants to have non-negative mass dimensions. If a coupling has a negative dimension, the theory is not renormalizable because the interaction terms would have higher dimensions, leading to a lack of a cutoff scale (like in effective field theories).

So, first, let's figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions. So every term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down the terms in L_int:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_mu nu, ψ, and F^{mu nu}.

I know that the Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the equation of motion for ψ is ∂_mu ψ ~ mass terms, and since ∂_mu has dimension 1, ψ must have dimension 3/2 to make the terms in the equation of motion (like (∂γ^μ ψ) and mψ) have the same dimension. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

Now, what about σ_{mu nu}? It's (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so the commutator is dimensionless. Hence, σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

Next, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field tensor F is the derivative of the gauge field A, so F^{mu nu} = ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Since A has dimension 1 (because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to match), then each derivative ∂ brings dimension 1. So F has dimension 2. Because each derivative is dimension 1, and F is two derivatives acting on A, which is dimension 1, so overall F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together:

The term is κ * (ψ̄) * (σ) * (ψ) * (F).

Each ψ̄ and ψ has dimension 3/2, so multiplied together, that's 3. σ is dimensionless, so no contribution. F has dimension 2.

So the entire term's dimension is [κ] + 3 + 2.

The Lagrangian has dimension 4, so:

[κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That rules out options B and D, which say the dimension is 1.

Now, whether the theory is renormalizable. The rule is that couplings with positive or zero mass dimension are okay for renormalizability. Negative dimensions imply non-renormalizable because the interaction term is higher-dimensional, leading to higher-order divergences that can't be absorbed by the same renormalization constants.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the term is in the Lagrangian, and the coupling is κ. A dimensionful coupling would imply it's an effective theory with a cutoff. For renormalizable theories, the coupling constants are dimensionless. So if the coupling has [κ]=−1 (mass dimension), which is negative, the interaction term has dimension 4 (because L must be dim 4), but the coupling itself is dimensionful.

Wait, no. The Lagrangian term's dimension is 4. The term is κ ψ̄ σψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, F is 2, σ is 0. So [κ] + 3/2 +3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 4 =4 → [κ] =0? Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is dimensionless, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 *2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the product is dimension 5. So the term κ (times this) must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] =-1. So I was correct earlier.

So [κ] is -1. That's negative. So the coupling is dimensionful. So the theory is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

A) dim -1, renormalizable → no, because dim is negative.

B) dim +1, ren → no, because our calculation says dim is -1.

C) dim -1, not ren → yes, that's our conclusion.

D) dim +1, not ren → no.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is dimensionless, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor with mass dimension 2. The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $3/2$, and $\bar{\psi}$ also has dimension $3/2$.

The Lagrangian must have a total mass dimension of 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the dimensions of the terms in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$:
- $\bar{\psi}$ contributes $3/2$.
- $\psi$ contributes $3/2$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

The total dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This rules out options A and B, which claim the theory is renormalizable. Option D is incorrect because it assigns a positive dimension to $\kappa$. The correct answer is therefore:

**The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.**

Answer: C
