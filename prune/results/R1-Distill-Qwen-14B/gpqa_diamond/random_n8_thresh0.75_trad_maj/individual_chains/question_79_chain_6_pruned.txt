Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The compound X is C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, right? I think it's commonly used in the Birch reduction, but wait, Birch reduction is for aromatic rings, usually under different conditions. Oh wait, another reaction... Maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? Because I remember that epoxide ring openings can happen under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotection reaction or a cyclopropane ring opening? Not sure yet.

The product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded or in a symmetrical environment.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, possibly another methyl group. Wait, same shift as the first? Or maybe two different methyl groups with similar shifts. But same integration, 3H each.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. Could be part of a coupling in an aromatic system, maybe adjacent to another proton.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons or perhaps part of a vinyl group adjacent to substituents.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, perhaps another aromatic proton, maybe meta or ortho to something.
- δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons, another doublet. Maybe another set of aromatic protons, like adjacent to substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- δ 21.3 (1C, s): Methyl group, probably attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Wait, but 21 is low for a CH3 attached to oxygen. Maybe a CH3 in a ketone? Or perhaps a CH3 in a substituted benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3 attached to an epoxide ring, but I'm not sure.
- δ 28.4 (1C, s): Another carbon, maybe another CH3, perhaps in a more shielded environment. Wait, 28 is a bit higher than the typical methyl, but maybe it's a CH3 attached to a ring or something else.
- The rest are around 126-144, which are typical for carbons in aromatic rings or double bonds. Also, there's
