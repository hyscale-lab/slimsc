Okay, so I've got this question about SARS-CoV-2's molecular biology. It's a multiple-choice question asking which statement is incorrect. Let me try to think through each option.

The question says all statements are correct except one. So I need to find the incorrect one.

Option A: SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to nsp10, making an active exonuclease complex that prevents dsRNA breakdown.

Wait, I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 are part of the exoribonuclease complex. The SARS-CoV-2 uses this complex to correct errors in the RNA. But wait, if they form a heterodimer, that's correct. Oh, and nsp14 has an exoN domain, right. So the complex prevents dsRNA from being broken down. Hmm, but wait, I thought that the exoribonuclease activity is involved in RNA repair, but would it prevent dsRNA breakdown? Or does it actually process it? Maybe. I'm not sure about this one yet.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. So if ORF3a affects caspase-8 but not Bcl-2, the apoptosis is via extrinsic. I remember that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger apoptosis, but I'm not certain about
