Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

Wait, so the velocities here are 0.6c and 0.5c. Let me assign them correctly. Since both are in the positive x-direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So astronaut A (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B (mass 3m) at 0.5c. So the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is 0.1c / 0.7. Let's compute that: 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, so about 0.143c. So the relative speed is roughly 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy. I think the total energy of the system is the sum of their relativistic energies. Oh wait, relativistic energy is given by gamma times mc squared. So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m_i * c², where m_i is their mass and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for astronaut A (2m, velocity 0.6c): gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute that. v is 0.6c, so v² is 0.36c². 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B (3m, 0.5c): v is 0.5c, so v² is 0.25c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m * c² = approx 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option D says 5 mc², which is lower. So the correct E is about 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that must be the right answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation for relative speed. So formula (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Plugging in 0.6c and 0.5c:

v
