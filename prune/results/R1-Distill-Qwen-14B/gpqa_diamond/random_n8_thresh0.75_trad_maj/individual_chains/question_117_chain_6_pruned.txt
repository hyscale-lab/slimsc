Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. So, the presence of such centers would mean the compound can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Biphenyl structures can have different substituents on each ring. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe they don't cause the molecule to be chiral. But wait, this compound has two nitro groups on each of the 6 positions and two carboxylate groups on the 2 positions of each phenyl ring. Let me visualize the structure. So, each phenyl ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. Are these positions such that they create a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are all in such a way that the molecule has symmetry, then it might not have chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself could have some kind of stereogenic centers. Wait, but the biphenyl usually doesn't contribute to chirality because of the possibility of rotation around the central bond, unless it's a rigid structure with substituents that can't rotate into each other's positions. If the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation (like when they're in the ortho, meta, para positions), then maybe the molecule has a chiral axis or a chiral plane? Or perhaps the substituents themselves are such that each carbon is bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, maybe the two substituents on each phen
