Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then determining the final product. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, wait—wait, maybe it's more about eliminating something else. Oh wait, another reaction comes to mind. Oh right, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an alkyne. No, wait, red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, right? Or was that for something else?

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the formation of carboxylic acids from nitriles. Oh wait, no, nitriles can be hydrolyzed with HIO4 or something like that. Alternatively, another possibility is that X is a nitrile, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into a carboxylic acid.

But let me look at the data provided. So, the IR and NMR of compound X.

The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. Wait, but 1720 is lower than a typical aldehyde (which is around 2800 for the C-H stretch and about 1720 for the C=O). Alternatively, a ketone's C=O is around 1715, maybe. But wait, another thought: if there's a carbonyl, maybe an ester or a nitrile. Wait, no, nitriles have C≡N around 2200-2250. The IR here doesn't show that, so probably not a nitrile.

Wait, looking at the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1610 might be the stretching for the aromatic ring, and the 1450 perhaps a substituent causing some conjugation or substitution pattern.

Now looking at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong deshielded proton. Broad singlet. Could this be an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid? Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. Oh wait, but if X is the starting material, and it's a nitrile, then maybe after reaction it becomes a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the question is about the product, so I need to figure out what X is first.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is probably a phenolic OH or a carboxylic acid OH. Wait, but in the NMR, if it's a broad singlet and only 1H, it's probably an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton, but those are usually sharp singlets, not broad. Hmm.

Next signal: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of doublets. So, the aromatic protons are in a para arrangement. Maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents—wait, but the integration is 2H each. So perhaps a substituent in the para position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Like, for example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, but wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement? No, the doublets for 2H each usually suggest a substituent in the para position, making the protons opposite each other. So, like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with substituents at positions 2 and 6? Wait, no, that might cause different splitting. Alternatively, it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Or a substituent in the para position and another group attached elsewhere.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzene. For example, if you have a substituent at position 4 (para) and another at position 2 or 6, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons. So, for instance, if you have a substituent in the para position, the protons next to it would be ortho and meta to the substituent.

Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the protons adjacent would be downfield shifted. So, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position that's an acyl group or something similar.

Looking further in the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, probably a CH group adjacent to something, maybe near an oxygen or another electronegative atom. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The 1.7 ppm is likely a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to the aromatic ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, probably attached to a CH2-CH2- etc., like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a chain. Let me try to imagine it. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but ketones have carbonyl groups that would show up in IR around 1700. Wait, the IR has 1720, which could be a ketone or an ester or maybe a nitrile (but earlier I thought no nitrile).

Wait, another angle: the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That's characteristic of an ester (around 1740 maybe?), or a ketone (around 1715), or maybe an aldehyde (around 1720-1740). But if the IR doesn't show the C≡N stretch (which is around 2250), then it's not a nitrile.

So, putting together the NMR:

- 10.5: possibly an aldehyde, but let's consider that. Then, the aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group ending with an aldehyde. Wait, but then the substituent would be at the para position, and the aldehyde is on a side chain.

Wait, but considering the other NMR signals. Let's list all the peaks:

10.5 ppm (1H, broad): maybe an aldehyde proton.

8.0 ppm (2H, d): aromatic protons.

7.2 ppm (2H, d): another set of aromatic protons.

2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps a CH adjacent to an electronegative group.

1.7 ppm (2H, m): maybe a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (3H, d): a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH.

0.9 ppm (3H, t): an ethyl group's terminal methyl.

Wait, could this be a benzaldehyde derivative with a side chain? Let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position which is a propyl group attached to an aldehyde. So, the structure would be something like:

Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO

Wait, but that would give certain NMR signals. The aldehyde proton would be around 9.8-10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm signal. Then the aromatic protons would be deshielded due to the substituent. The CH2 groups would show up around 2.9 and 1.7 ppm? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the substituent might have a branching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone. Wait, but then the IR at 1720 would suggest a ketone. But the 10.5 ppm proton doesn't fit a ketone, since ketones don't have protons. So, back to the aldehyde idea.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to an aldehyde. So, the benzene has a propyl group at para, with the aldehyde
