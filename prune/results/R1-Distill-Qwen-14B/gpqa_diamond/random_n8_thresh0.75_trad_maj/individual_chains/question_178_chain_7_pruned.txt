Okay, so I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ in this Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh wait, and F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, which comes from the gauge field A. Right, F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ.

So the first step is to determine the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four dimensions in the action, making the action dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Breaking down the terms in L_int: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, multiplied by σ_{μν}, multiplied by ψ, and multiplied by F^{μν}.

I know the mass dimensions for some of these fields. Let me recall:

- Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, a Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄, which is the adjoint, also has 3/2.

- The field strength F^{μν} for electromagnetism is a tensor built from the gauge field A, which has mass dimension 1. The derivatives have dimension 1 each. So F^{μν} is ∂ A, which would be (mass^1) * (mass^1) = mass^2. Wait, no, F is a tensor with each index μ, ν being spacetime indices, so each derivative is dimension 1. So F^{μν} is ∂A, so each component is [∂ A] = [mass^1] * [A]. Since A has dimension 1, F has dimension 2.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices. The commutator of two gammas is another gamma structure,
