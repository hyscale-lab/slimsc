Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, phase shifts are important, and they relate to the scattering amplitude. 

The question gives me the phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so I guess that's all the phase shifts we're considering. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a formula involving the partial waves. Each partial wave has a phase shift δ_l, right? The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (something with e^{iδ} and sin terms). Oh wait, more accurately, I think it's f(θ) = sum over l of [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) / (2ik) * (2l+1) * (sin δ_l) / sin(θ) ) ] or something like that. Wait, maybe I should get the exact expression.

Wait, no, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik) * (2l+1) ) * P_l(cosθ) ], where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, along the incident direction, which is θ=0°, so cosθ=1. So the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the expression simplifies a lot.

Wait, but wait, I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f(θ). So f(θ) is a complex quantity, and I'm looking for Im(f(θ)) at θ=0.

So, let me think again. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} − 1) / (2ik) * (2l + 1) ) * P_l(cosθ) ]

At θ=0°, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) =
