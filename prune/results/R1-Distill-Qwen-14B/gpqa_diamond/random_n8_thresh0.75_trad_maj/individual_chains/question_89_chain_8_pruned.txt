Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through each step.

First, the first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. So, the product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Yellow solids often make me think of alkenes, maybe? Or perhaps something else, but elimination usually gives alkenes.

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, no, wait. Wait, elimination would give an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I messed up the reaction. Oh wait, KOH could also dehydrohalogenate, but maybe not. Or maybe it's a substitution, but wait, since it's vicinal, elimination is more likely. Wait, but wait, if it's a dihalide, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the bromines were.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but for that, maybe we're getting a diol? Wait, but that would give an alcohol, and the IR would show O-H stretches, which are broader. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides have different IR features. Wait, maybe the reaction is producing a ketone? How? Hmm. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: so it's a molecule where the adamantane framework has two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH. Could it be a dehydrohalogenation? Because if the bromines are in positions that allow for elimination, it would form a double bond. But if the resulting structure forms an alkene, then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR of product 1. The
