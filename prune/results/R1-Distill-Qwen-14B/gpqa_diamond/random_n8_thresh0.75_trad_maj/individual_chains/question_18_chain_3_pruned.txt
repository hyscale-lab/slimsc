Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that the brackets in the notation like [Si/Fe]_1 mean the logarithm of the ratio of their abundances relative to the Sun. Oh right, because the brackets are logarithmic scales using base 10.

So, the problem gives me data for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me list out the given information.

For Star_1:
- Mass is 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- Mass is 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg/Si ratio in Star_2 is 10^(0.3) times the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, so we need to find the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1] or the other way around? Or wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

But how? Let's think about the steps. We can relate the abundances using the given ratios.

First, I think I need to find the ratio of Si/H in each star. Because once I have that for both, I can take the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2.

Starting with Star_1. The [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning [Fe/H] = 0. So, Fe/H for Star_1 is 10^0 = 1. So Fe abundance is same as Sun.

The [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Which means (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_Sun. So, the Si/Fe ratio is higher than the Sun's by a factor of 10^0.3.

Wait, wait. Let me get the Sun's ratios correct. The problem gives the photospheric composition for the Sun as:
