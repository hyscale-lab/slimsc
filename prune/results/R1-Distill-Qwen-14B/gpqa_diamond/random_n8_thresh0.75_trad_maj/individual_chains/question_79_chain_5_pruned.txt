Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on NMR data after a specific reaction. Let's break it down.

The compound X is C11H12O. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. Oh wait, maybe it's used for deprotonation to form an epoxide? Or wait, no, I think more accurately, it's used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Or wait, isn't it a catalyst for certain types of reactions, like in the Sharpless epoxidation? Or maybe in other kinds of epoxide openings. Wait, no, Sharpless uses a different catalyst. Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, maybe used in the epoxide ring-opening reactions, perhaps in the formation of epoxides? Or maybe it's an acid in some reactions. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I recall that this base is used in the Baylis-Hillman reaction, but that's for forming β-keto carbonyl compounds. Wait, perhaps I should think about what reaction conditions might lead to an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alkene and the reaction forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic opening or something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them are epoxides. The options are A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, D) 2-styrylepoxide. So the product after reaction is an epoxide. Wait, but no—the product is the result of the reaction. Wait, the question says the product is from compound X reacting with the base. Hmm, so perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Wait, but I don't think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used as an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's used to open an epoxide ring. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplic
