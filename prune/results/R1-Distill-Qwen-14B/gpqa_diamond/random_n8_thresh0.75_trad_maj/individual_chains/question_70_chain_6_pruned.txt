Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are several reactions given, and we need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, with various symmetry groups.

First, I'll try to break down the reactions. Let's list them out.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure what all these substances are, but let's think about possible candidates.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B â†’ C (bright red). I know that in some reactions, metals react with gases. For example, maybe A is a metal. Bright red product... Could it be something like Cu reacting with something?

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Let's see: 8 equivalents of Cl2 with Na. Sodium has a valency of 1, so 8 Cl2 would mean 16 Cl atoms. That would form NaCl. But NaCl is a white solid, not red. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe A is copper (Cu), and B is sulfur (S8). But 8 equivalents would be 8 S molecules, each S8 giving 8 S atoms. So 8 * 8 = 64 S atoms? Wait, that might make CuS, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where copper is heated with sulfur to form CuS, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is something else. Wait, 8 equivalents. Aluminum typically has a valency of 3, so 8 equivalents would mean maybe 8 molecules of something. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a halogen, but the product is something else.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) nitrate, but that's not red. Oh wait, maybe C is a compound with a red color. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Wait, another thought: Maybe A is iron and B is oxygen. Iron and O2 react to form FeO or Fe3O4. Fe
