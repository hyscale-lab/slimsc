Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly affect the abundance calculations, since the question is about photospheric compositions. So maybe I can ignore the mass for this part.

The elements given are Si, Fe, Mg, and H. The problem provides the following data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, then compute the ratio between them.

Let me recall. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, more accurately, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉. So, it's the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The definition can be a bit tricky. The standard notation is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, for Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0. So, Star_1's Fe/H is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] would be 0 by definition. But here, Star_1's [Fe/H] is given as 0, which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg_2 /
