Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In a vacuum, it's longer because there are fewer gas molecules around, so less chance of collisions.

The scenario says Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He found some gas particles were still present, and he measured the mean free path as λ1. Then, when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The temperature stayed the same, so that shouldn't affect it much.

Wait, what affects the mean free path? Oh right, pressure. Lower pressure means longer mean free path because there are fewer gas molecules, so less frequent collisions. But wait, the pressure is already very low, so why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, it's generating a lot of electrons. Those electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Maybe the gas molecules are getting charged? Like, the electrons from the beam could collide with the gas atoms, causing them to ionize. So the gas becomes ionized, meaning the molecules have a charge.

Ionized particles would attract or repel each other. So the gas ions would have more interactions—like with each other and maybe even with the electron beam. That would increase the effective pressure in some way. But wait, the actual pressure doesn't change because the pumps are still running, right? But the mean free path is about how often they collide. If the gas becomes ionized, perhaps the mean free path decreases because the ionized particles are more likely to stick together or collide more frequently due to electrostatic interactions.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas particles have a different effective cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh, wait, ions have a larger effective area because they have electron clouds. So the mean free path should decrease because collisions happen more often. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the mean free path λ2 is shorter than λ1. That would mean λ2 is less than λ1. So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the case here.

Wait, but wait another thought. The electron beam itself might be a source of collisions. The high-energy electrons could be hitting the gas atoms, causing them to scatter more. So the electrons are providing another source of collisions for the gas molecules. That would mean the effective mean free
