Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to find out what the final product is based on the NMR data provided and the options given.

First, let me look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I remember that when dealing with NMR, the structure can tell a lot, especially about the functional groups and substituents.

The NMR data is given as:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I need to figure out what this structure looks like. Let's think about the peaks:

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So this suggests an aldehyde group (-CHO). The triplet integration of 1H probably means it's next to a CH2 group because that would give two neighboring protons, making a triplet. Wait, or maybe a coupling with two protons on adjacent carbons... Hmm, or maybe it's part of an enol structure? Not sure yet.

Next, the 6.98 ppm doublet (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm doublet (d, 2H) likely correspond to aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests substituents on the aromatic ring. The doublets indicate each set has two equivalent protons, possibly from a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups? Or perhaps two different substituents in para positions.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad signals can be from alcohols or possibly enol protons or something exchanging. If it's a singlet, maybe two equivalent protons not split by any neighboring protons. Wait, but in an enol form, the protons might be near each other. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like in a dienol or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause this? Not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet (d, 2H). That's in the range of CH2 groups, perhaps attached to an electronegative atom. The doublet suggests each of these two protons is next to another set of two protons. Wait, so maybe a CH2 connected to something else. If it's a CH2O group or something like that. For example, if it's adjacent to another CH2, maybe part of a ketone or aldehyde structure? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, like in a propenal? Wait, or maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (since there are two sets of doublets in aromatic regions), and a CH2 group attached somewhere. Let's think about the molecular formula again: C8H9NO. So maybe it's a substituted phenyl group connected to a butenone or something similar.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula has 8 carbons. If two of them are in two phenyl groups (each phenyl is 6 carbons, but since it's two, that would be 12, which is way more than 8
