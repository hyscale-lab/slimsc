Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But let's take it step by step. 

Okay, the question says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? So in this solution, what's happening? I remember that phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps. The relevant K values are given: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, I think. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, maybe? Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When dissolved, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, along with the water of crystallization, but I think that doesn't affect the ions in solution.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Hmm, I remember that when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they can form a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another to become PO4^3-. But wait, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So maybe I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the ions present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how does that lead
