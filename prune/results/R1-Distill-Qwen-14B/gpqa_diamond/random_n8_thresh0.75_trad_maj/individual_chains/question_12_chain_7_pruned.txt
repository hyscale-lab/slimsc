Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) with 139.6 MeV and mu(+) with 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. Interesting.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. The problem doesn't specify the mass of the neutrino, so I think I can assume it's massless. That should simplify things because then the neutrino's energy would be just pc, but I have to be careful with units here.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the total energy available in the decay. Since the pion is at rest, its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

2. The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy comes purely from its momentum.

3. Apply conservation of energy and momentum.

So, the total energy after decay must equal the initial energy, which is just the pion's rest energy. So,

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

And the initial momentum is zero, so the vector sum of the muon and neutrino momenta must be zero. So,

p_mu + p_nu = 0

But since neutrino's mass is zero, E_nu = |p_nu| * c. Similarly, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

But wait, let's model this with variables.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu is |p| * c.

Wait, but units here are in MeV and MeV/c, so perhaps I should handle the units carefully. Let's think in natural units where c=1. So energy is MeV, mass is MeV/cÂ², but when c=1, mass becomes MeV, and momentum is MeV/c.

Wait, maybe it's better to proceed in terms of energy-momentum four-vectors. Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant mass approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic (since its rest mass is zero).

Wait, no. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, but the muon's energy also depends on its momentum. So, the muon's energy E_mu is gamma*m_mu*c^2. The neutrino's energy E_nu is its momentum
