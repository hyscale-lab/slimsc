Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. The first thing I think I need to do is normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. 

So, to normalize, I'll calculate the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i), since the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), and their conjugates are (1-i) and (2+i) respectively. 

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. And (2 - i)(2 + i) is 4 + 2i - 2i - (i^2) = 4 - (-1) = 5. So adding those gives 2+5=7. So the norm squared is 7, which means the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the A matrix would look like this:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, the element is ħ/2, and when i = j, it's 0. Hmm, that matrix is a familiar one. Oh right! This is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling that by ħ/2 gives us the matrix A here.

So the operator in question is (ħ/2) times σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The matrix A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So when you diagonalize it, the eigenvalues would be the eigenvalues of Pauli X multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the possible measurement outcomes are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the states |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. These states can be written in terms of the |up> and |down> basis states.

I recall that the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. So, the eigenstates of operator A are these states, and we need to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>.

So, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate. Let me denote |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

First, let's write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, the inner product with |+x> is:

⟨+x | alpha⟩ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (⟨up| + ⟨down|) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So, expanding this, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|down> ) ]

But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, ⟨up|down> = 0 and ⟨down|up> = 0. So this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify the numerator: 1+i + 2 -i = 3. So it's 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The absolute value squared is (3)^2 / (2 *7) ) = 9/(14).

Similarly, the inner product with |−x> is:

⟨−x | alpha⟩ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (⟨up| - ⟨down|) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Expanding:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|up> - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|up> - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|down> ) ]

Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully. Let me compute each term:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (⟨up| + (-⟨down|)) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) ⟨up|up>  + (- (2 -i)) ⟨down|up> + (1+i) ⟨down|up> ) + (- (2 -i)) ⟨down|down> ) ]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in expanding. Let me try again. The expansion is:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ⟨up|down> 
  + (-1) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|up> + (-1) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ⟨down|down> ) ]

Again, since ⟨up|down> and ⟨down|up> are zero, the middle terms vanish. So we're left with:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (-1)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Simplify the numerator: (1 + i - 2 + i ) = (-1 + 2i)

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14.

Wait, let me calculate that. The numerator is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5. So |⟨−x | alpha⟩|^2 =5/14.

Wait, but wait a second. The probabilities from |+x> and |−x> should add up to 1. Let me check: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. That makes sense. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but looking at the options, the probabilities are given as 0.64, 0.36; 0.54, 0.46; 0.28, 0.72; 0.61, 0.29. Hmm. 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 64.3% and 35.7%. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is pretty close. So maybe the answer is A, but let me check the other parts.

The next part is to find the average value of the operator. The average value is ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A is given by (ħ/2) σ_x, the average value would be (ħ/2) ⟨alpha | σ_x | alpha⟩.

Another approach: since σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and the expectation value can be found as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. Wait, but that might not directly apply here because |alpha> isn't necessarily an eigenstate of σ_x. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it directly.

So let's compute ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩. Let's write down the matrix A and the state |alpha> in the |up>, |down> basis.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So, to compute A|alpha>, it's:

A|alpha> = [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), 
            (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), 
  ( ħ/2 (1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Then, the inner product ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So, |alpha> is a column vector, and ⟨alpha| is a row vector [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, let's compute ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩:

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( ħ/2 (1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]^T

This is the sum of (1 - i)*( ħ/2 (2 - i) ) /7 + (2 +i)*( ħ/2 (1 + i) ) /7.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Multiply by ħ/2: (1 -3i) * (ħ/2)

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Multiply by ħ/2: (1 +3i) * ħ/2.

So adding both terms:

(1 -3i + 1 +3i) * (ħ/2) /7 = (2) * (ħ/2) /7 = ( ħ ) /7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, that's neat. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A's average is hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again, because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute the terms.

First, the first term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + (i^2). i^2 is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1+3i.

So the product becomes:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2. So when multiplied by (ħ/2) and divided by 7, it's (2 * ħ/2 ) /7 = (ħ) /7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it all together: the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, and the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me check the other parts. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the inner product calculations.

Another approach: perhaps using the expectation value formula for σ_x. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_x.

The expectation of σ_x for |alpha> is given by (alpha_up * alpha_down* + alpha_down * alpha_up* ) / (|alpha_up|^2 + |alpha_down|^2 )

Wait, perhaps another way.

The expectation value of σ_x for a state |ψ> = a|up> + b|down> is (a b* + a* b) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2
