Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. I remember that NMR can give a lot of structural information, so I'll need to analyze the signals carefully.

First, the reaction conditions: compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common catalyst used in the Sharpless epoxidation. So this reaction is probably an epoxidation of a double bond. Sharpless epoxidation typically forms an epoxide from an allylic alcohol, but wait, wait, no—if the starting material is a diene, maybe it's just forming an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So the product is the epoxide of compound X. So compound X must have a double bond that can undergo epoxidation. So the product would be an epoxide, which has an oxygen in a three-membered ring.

Looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's parse the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 
6.75 (1H, d), 
7.08 (2H, d), 
7.68 (1H, d), 
7.71 (2H, d).

So there's two singlet triplets integrating to 3H each. Singlets mean no neighboring protons, so probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have adjacent Hs. Like maybe attached to an electronegative atom or a ring where symmetry makes them equivalent. Wait, but in this case, two singlets for 3H each—so maybe two methyl groups attached to different parts but each in a symmetric environment.

The aromatic region has six protons in total. Let's see: 1H as a doublet, 2H as a doublet, another 1H as a doublet, and 2H as a doublet. Hmm, that might form a substituent on a benzene ring with specific coupling.

Wait, in aromatic regions, the splitting (d, doublet) suggests that each proton is coupled with one neighboring proton. So maybe a para-substituted benzene? No, wait. For example, in a styrene group (vinylbenzene), the protons on the double bond would couple with each other. Wait, but in an epoxide, the double bond is converted into an epoxide, so the original double bond would have been part of a styryl group (CH2-CH2 with double bond).

Wait, perhaps the aromatic signals are from a benzene ring attached to a substituent. Let me think: the four doublets might be from a di-substituted benzene. Let me imagine substituents in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic region corresponds to a para-substituted benzene with substituents that lead to the observed splitting.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows four doublets in the aromatic region. Let me see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, that's a total of (1+2+1+2) = 6 H. So perhaps two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. Hmm, maybe it's a substituent on a benzene ring where the substituent has more than one proton, but that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps the substituent is a group that itself has protons, like a propenyl group or something.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzene with substituents leading to four different protons. But I'm not sure. Let's look at the 13C NMR next.

13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s), 
28.4 (1C, s), 
126.9 (2C, s), 
127.1 (1C, s), 
129.1 (2C, s), 
130.3 (1C, s), 
141.5 (1C, s), 
144.1 (1C, s), 
197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, there's a carbon at 197.7. I remember that carbonyl carbons (like ketones or epoxides) are around 170-220 ppm. Wait, but epoxide carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm? No, wait I might be getting that wrong. Wait, no, wait. For epoxide carbons, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen are deshielded and usually appear around 50-60 ppm, maybe? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think: carbonyl groups like ketones are around 200-220, and epoxides might have carbons at lower ppm. Alternatively, maybe the 197.7 is an carbonyl, perhaps a ketone, but that might not fit with an epoxide.

Wait, wait, in epoxide rings, the two carbon atoms adjacent to the oxygen are typically around 55-65 ppm. The oxygen is part of a three-membered ring, which causes some ring strain, leading to deshielding. So maybe the 197.7 is something else. Wait, perhaps it's an ester or another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic position.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide. So the epoxide would have two carbons connected to the oxygen. Let me think: the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is high. That might be an carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide but also some other carbonyl group.

Wait, let me recount the carbons. The formula of compound X is C11H12O. So, after epoxidation, which adds an oxygen, the product would be C11H10O2? Because epoxidation replaces a double bond (which is two carbons with two Hs) with an epoxide (two carbons each bonded to an O). Wait, no, wait. The original compound has a double bond, say between carbons 1 and 2. Epoxidation would add an oxygen to create an epoxide ring, so the formula would change from CnH2m to CnH2m-2O. Wait, let's see: the original compound is C11H
