Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down what I know and work through it.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the coefficients are complex, and the probabilities depend on the squares of the magnitudes.

Wait, right, the normalization is done by dividing by the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. Let me calculate each coefficient's magnitude.

For the |up> component, the coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So that squared is 2.

For the |down> component, the coefficient is (2-i). The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So squared that's 5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal, but here it's scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are usually written as sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So if the operator A is given by A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise, then it's (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

So the operator is A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the operator A, since it's just a scaled version. So to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue, I need to find the eigenstates of A and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates.

Wait, but sigma_x has eigenvalues +/-1. So for A,
