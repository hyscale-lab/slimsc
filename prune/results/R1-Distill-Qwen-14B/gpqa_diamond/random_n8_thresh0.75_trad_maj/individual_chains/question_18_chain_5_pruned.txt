Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their compositions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question is asking about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me parse the given data. Both stars have masses higher than the Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass matters here, since the question is about elemental abundances. Oh wait, maybe not. The problem says to use the LTE and EW method, so I think elemental abundances are given, and maybe the masses are just extra information.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Wait, what do these symbols mean again? Oh right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So a positive value means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Let me jot down what I know:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(Si/Fe) in Star_1 = 0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun?
Wait, no. [X/Y] is usually defined as log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the [X/Y] notation is logarithmic. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Wait, wait, the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Hmmm, [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means [Fe/H]_1 = log10(n_Fe/n_H in Star_1) - log10(n_Fe/n_H
