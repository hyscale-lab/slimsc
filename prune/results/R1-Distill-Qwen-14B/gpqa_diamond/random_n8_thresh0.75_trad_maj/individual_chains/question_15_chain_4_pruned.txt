Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose to observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like, detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits.

Hmm, wait, I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size. Oh right, the probability that a planet transits its star is roughly proportional to (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis (or orbital radius) of the planet, and R_star is the radius of the star. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our viewpoint, which is a small area relative to the star's disk.

But wait, the star's radius is the same for both planets. Both host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they share radii. So the key factors would be their orbital distances.

Oh right, Kepler's third law. The orbital period relates to the semi-major axis and the star's mass. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than their stars, we can approximate M+m ≈ M. So P² is proportional to a³/(M). Or more accurately, a³ is proportional to P² * M.

So for each planet, a₁³ = ( G (M₁ + m) / (4π²) ) * (P₁ / (2π))² )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the proportionality. Since both planets have the same mass (probably negligible compared to stars), a³ is proportional to (P²) * (M_star). Because M is the star's mass.

So for Planet_1: a₁³ ∝ P₁² * M₁
For Planet_2: a₂³ ∝ P₂² * M₂

But M₁ is twice M₂. Because the host star of Planet_1 has a mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M₁ = 2*M₂.

Also, P₁ is three times shorter than P₂. So P₁ = P₂ / 3.

Wait, no. The question says the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

So let me plug in the numbers. Let me define P₁ = P₂/3.

Now, let's compute a₁³ / a₂³.

a₁³ / a₂³ = (P₁² * M₁) / (P₂² * M₂) = ( ( (P₂/3)² * 2 M₂ ) ) / ( P₂² * M₂ )

Simplify numerator: (P₂² /9 ) * 2 M₂ = (2/9) P₂² M₂

Denominator: P₂² M₂.

So a₁³ / a₂³ = (2/9) P₂² M₂ / (P₂² M₂ ) = 2/9.

So a₁³ = (2/9) a₂³ → a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3).

Hmm, wait, let's compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a₁ is roughly 0.6 times a₂.

But wait, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since R_star is the same, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So higher a means lower probability.

So probability for each planet: P_prob ∝ 1/a.

So P1_prob / P2_prob = (1/a₁)/(1/a₂) = a₂ / a₁.

From earlier, a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a₂ * 0.608.

So a₂/a₁ ≈ 1 / 0.608 ≈ 1.645.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 1.645
