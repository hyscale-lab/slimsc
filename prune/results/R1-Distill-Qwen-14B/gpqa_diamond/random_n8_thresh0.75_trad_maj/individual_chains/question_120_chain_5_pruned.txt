Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, because parallax is the apparent shift in position when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. So a star with a high parallax is nearby, and a low parallax means it's far away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So same number per unit volume, I guess. But wait, not exactly. Because when we look at the sky, the number of stars we see depends on how far away they are. So if they are uniformly distributed, the number density is the same throughout space.

But how do we relate this to parallax? Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), because p = 1/d (in parsecs). So as p decreases, d increases.

We're asked about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say we're considering a small change in parallax, Δp. We want to find how the number of stars (N) in that range Δp depends on p.

Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. So let
