Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves two reactions with different reducing agents. The products are enantiomers of each other. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. Actually, looking again, the problem says:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ gives (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ gives (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, actually, no, the reaction 1 uses LiBH4, and reaction 2 uses BH3. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3 in some contexts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about selecting the proper starting materials A and B for each reaction. The options are combinations of (S) and (R) configurations for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the starting materials are these pentanoic acid derivatives, and the products are tetrahydropyran-2-ones. Oh, right, so I think these are examples of ketone reductions, but wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are usually used in reductions. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, the starting materials have an isobutoxy group and an oxo group. Oh, wait, the structure of the starting material is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So that's a pentanoic acid with substituents on the 5th carbon. The 5th carbon has an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2CH3)2?) and an oxo (keto) group.

So, the structure would be: O=C-OCH2CH(CH2CH3) maybe? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents on the 5th carbon (which would be the alpha carbon to the carboxylic acid, I think, but wait, in pentanoic acid, the chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, but the substituents are on the 5th carbon. Wait, maybe it's more like:

The structure is probably:

CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2? Or is the isobutoxy on the same carbon as the carbonyl?

Wait, the name is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid has the structure CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The pentanoic acid is numbered from the carboxylic acid end. So, position 1 is the COOH, position 2 is the adjacent CH2, etc. So, the substituents are at position 5. So, the structure would be
