Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Here, the problem is relativistic, so that changes things.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds approach the speed of light. So I need to use relativistic equations of motion, perhaps the relativistic harmonic oscillator model.

In the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the equations of motion involve the relativistic momentum. Let me recall the equation. The force is F = -k x, but in relativistic terms, F is the derivative of the relativistic momentum. Oh wait, relativistic momentum p is gamma m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So F = d p/dt = d/dt (gamma m v). Since F = -k x and x is a function of time, this would lead to a differential equation. Let me write that down:

F = d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But this is a second-order differential equation, and it's nonlinear because gamma depends on v, which depends on x and time.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of energy. In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2) m v² + (1/2)k x². But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)m v² anymore; it's (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy would be (gamma m c²) because gamma accounts for the total energy including rest mass.

Wait, wait. The total energy E = gamma m c². At the maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest (velocity zero), so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2) k A². But wait, is that correct in the relativistic case? Or is the potential still (1/2) k x² even when relativistic effects are considered? I think the potential form might not change if it's a harmonic oscillator because it's just a force law.

Wait, but that's maybe not the right approach. Because in the relativistic case, the expression for kinetic energy is different. So at maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is entirely potential. But at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma -1) m c².

But wait, in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², which should equal the maximum kinetic energy, (1/2) m v_max². But in relativistic case, the energy E is conserved, so E = (1/2) k A² = K_max + m c²? No, wait. Wait, the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy. So E_total = K + m c². Because
