Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. 

Alright, the given information is that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right answer.

Hmm, wait. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration given is 0.02 M. So, the Ca-EDTA is a complex that's already formed. 

I think I need to use the formation constant formula. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. The general reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

And the formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K = [Complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand.

Wait, but in this case, we know the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, is that the only species present? Probably, because the solution is made by dissolving the complex, so the other species would be the free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- ions. 

So the total concentration of EDTA and calcium would depend on the dissociation of the complex. But wait, since K is a large number (5e10), that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal. That means that very little of the complex would dissociate into free Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So I need to find [Ca²+].

Let me think. Let's denote [CaEDTA^2−] as C, which is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, each mole of Ca-EDTA that dissociates
