Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, which I remember is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

First, I need to figure out how to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write down the state vector as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The operator P_z is given as a 3x3 matrix:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, no, looking again, the P_z matrix is:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ, and the off-diagonal are zero.

Since the state |ψ⟩ is a column vector, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I can compute it by multiplying the matrix with the state vector and then taking the inner product.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in the given basis (which are the eigenvectors of P_z), the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because for diagonal matrices, each basis vector is an eigenvector, and the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the components of the state and λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait. The basis here is the eigenbasis of P_z. So each basis vector is an eigenvector of P_z, with eigenvalues hbar, 0, -hbar respectively. So the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in terms of these basis vectors. So each component of |ψ⟩ corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because each eigenstate contributes |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue.

So let's compute |c_i|^2 for each component.

The state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

The components are c₁ = -1/2, c₂ = 1/√2, c₃ = -1/2.

So |c₁|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c₂|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c₃|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

The eigenvalues of P_z are  ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective basis states.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 

Let me compute that: (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) = 0.

So
