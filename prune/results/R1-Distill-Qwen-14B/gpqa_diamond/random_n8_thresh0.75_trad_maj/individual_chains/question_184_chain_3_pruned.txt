Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which reaction sequence will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I know that substituting benzene rings typically involves electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are added matters because each substitution can activate or deactivate the ring, affecting where the next substituent goes.

The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me see their positions. The numbering would be such that the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So on a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So it's an ortho, meta arrangement.

Wait, but how? Let me visualize. Position 1: ethoxy. Then position 2: tert-butyl, and position 3: nitro. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, meaning they are meta to each other? No, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 2) and tert-butyl (position 3?). Wait, maybe I should sketch this.

But maybe it's better to think about the directing effects of
