Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the question is asking for the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding a particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the probability in that interval should be 100%, meaning the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That looks a bit strange. Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh wait, the wave function is a complex function. The given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5 times i. So that's a complex number: real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but to find the probability,
