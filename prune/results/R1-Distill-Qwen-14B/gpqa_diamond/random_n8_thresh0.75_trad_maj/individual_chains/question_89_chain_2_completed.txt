Okay, so I've been given this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about a reaction involving 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH, which probably leads to an elimination reaction. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1.

Looking at the 1H NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak at 1720 is a strong clue. That usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but wait, the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely cause elimination, forming an alkene. But if there's a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides typically don't have strong carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination that forms a ketone. Hmm, wait, KOH might not directly form a ketone. Maybe it's a ring-opening or a different elimination.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination or some kind of intramolecular elimination, but that usually applies to esters. Alternatively, maybe the bromide leaves, and the base abstracts a proton to form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, if two bromides are eliminated, perhaps as HBr, then they might form a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a ketone formed via a pinacol-like elimination. But pinacol usually involves vicinal diols, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When KOH is used, perhaps a double elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically gives alkenes. Alternatively, if there's a possibility for a ketone formation, perhaps via a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows a carbonyl, so product 1 must be a ketone. How does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Maybe it's a beta-elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't directly form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a double bond, but perhaps in a way that leads to a carbonyl upon further reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves as Br- and the adjacent H is abstracted, leading to a double bond between those two carbons. But then we'd have an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of a carbonyl via some kind of elimination. Wait, think about the structure. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But that doesn't produce a ketone. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have that strong a carbonyl peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another angle: The NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests that these protons are in a deshielded environment. Maybe they are next to an electronegative atom. But in a ketone, the adjacent protons would be more deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base—it could cause elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene. But the product isn't an alkene because of the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is more about elimination when dealing with vicinal dihalides. Wait, yes! When a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halogens) is treated with a strong base like KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe I was wrong about the IR. Let me think: another possibility is that the product is an epoxide. Wait, epoxides have a peak around 1250-1050 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. No, because the IR peak for epoxide is not at 1720. So product 1 must be a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the base induces a elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, if the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and the base abstracts a proton from a carbon next to one of the bromides, that would form a double bond. Wait, but that doesn't form a carbonyl. Unless it's a conjugated diene or some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that leads to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the KOH opens it up. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, and 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms at 1 and 3 positions. Maybe when KOH is added, the two Br atoms are eliminated, and the structure rearranges to form a ketone. Let's imagine that.

Wait, let me think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet because it's probably attached to the ketone. Wait, no, in a ketone, the adjacent protons are usually split. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether. But if it's a ketone, the H's next to it would be more deshielded.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that doesn't make much sense from a vicinal dihalide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. So perhaps it's a double elimination, as in dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't see how that would happen from a dihalide with KOH.

Wait, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would require hydrolysis, not elimination. Wait, but KOH is a base, not acidic. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where Br is replaced by OH, but that would give two hydroxyl groups, which would lead to a diol. But then, why the IR peak for carbonyl?

Wait, maybe after substitution, the diol undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if the diol is vicinal, it can lose water to form a double bond, but that would be an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the NMR data also includes a 1.94 (2H) and 2.41-2.23 (10H). Those are probably the adamantane ring protons. The 4.79 could be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like O.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, maybe the 4.79 is a neighboring group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the IR is actually indicating an ester or an aldehyde, but 1720 is more typical for a ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but that's less likely with KOH.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone. But without more NMR data, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe I should move on to the next steps, as sometimes the later reactions can give clues about the first product.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is used in some coupling reactions, like the Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group, so perhaps it's an acylation. So product 1 could be a ketone, and then product 2 would be a larger ketone after coupling.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But for Friedel-Crafts acylation, you need an acyl chloride. Hmm, but product 1 is a ketone. Maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and heating with aluminum isopropoxide does something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of alkylation. But I'm not certain.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That sounds like ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. The ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Putting it all together, let's try to outline the reactions:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (likely a conjugated diene or a ketone)
2. product 1 + aluminum isopropoxide → product 2 (maybe with a larger molecule or a substituted product)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

But wait, ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 1 must be a diene, perhaps, that can react further with aluminum isopropoxide to form a more substituted diene or another structure with a double bond.

Wait, going back to product 1. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, the product is likely a diene. Because two eliminations would occur, removing two HBr molecules and forming two double bonds? No, that's unlikely. More likely, a single elimination forming a double bond, but wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3. If each Br leaves and a proton is abstracted from adjacent carbons, that would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Or maybe a single double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4?

Wait, no, it's more likely that each Br is eliminated with a proton from adjacent carbons, but since the two Br are on 1 and 3, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene between carbons 1-2 and 3-4.

But then, product 1 would be a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction leads to an alkene (from elimination), and then another reaction forms a carbonyl. But that would require more steps, but the question says it's a single heating step with KOH. So product 1 is the result of that heating.

Wait, perhaps I should think that product 1 is an epoxide. Because KOH can cause epoxidation, but wait, no, epoxidation is typically done with peracids, not KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide-like structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck on product 1. Let me think again.

If the reaction is KOH heating of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, likely elimination occurs to form a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond. But the IR suggests a carbonyl. Unless the structure of adamantane upon elimination forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane is such that elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are not usually allowed due to Bredt's rule. So maybe the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, but then the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe product 1 is not an alkene but a ketone. How?

Wait another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double substitution, but with two Br atoms, perhaps leading to a structure where the two Br are replaced by OH groups. But that would give a diol. Then, perhaps the diol can undergo elimination to form a carbonyl. But that would require two elimination steps. But the conditions are heating with KOH, which is a base, so perhaps it's elimination.

Wait, if it's a diol, then heating with a base would cause elimination, forming a carbonyl. For example, vicinal diol (1,2-diol) under basic conditions can lose water to form a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

So, step by step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH, leading to substitution of Br with OH, forming a diol (1,3-diol). Then, under basic conditions, the 1,3-diol could eliminate two water molecules to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-diol is not adjacent, so elimination would require a different setup. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol that can undergo a Dieckmann-type elimination.

Wait, but the positions matter. If the diol is on 1 and 3, then perhaps upon elimination, it could form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diol can't form a ketone because the hydroxyl groups are not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to think of product 1's structure. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet perhaps, and 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 1.94 could be a CH2 group, and the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be multiple CH2 groups around the ring.

If product 1 is a diene, the NMR would show peaks around 5-6 ppm for the double bond protons, but that's not what's observed here. Instead, the high ppm is 4.79, which is more like an ether or a ketone adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: The NMR for product 1 has 4.79 (2H). Perhaps these are two protons next to an oxygen, like in a geminal diol. But geminal diols have two OHs on the same carbon, but that would lead to a singlet perhaps, but the integration is 2H.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, in an ether structure, such as R-O-CH2-CH2-R. Then, the protons on the CH2 next to oxygen would appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit high for that, but possible.

Wait, but then where is the carbonyl in the IR? If product 1 is an ether, then the IR peak wouldn't be at 1720 cm-1. So I'm back to square one.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the process of elimination. Let's see. Let me try to think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H).

So, product 1 has a carbonyl group, which is probably a ketone. The NMR suggests two protons as a singlet around 4.79 ppm, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. For example, a bridgehead ketone. But bridgehead ketones are possible if the structure allows.

Wait, if the structure of product 1 is a ketone, such as 1-adamantanone or something similar, then the NMR would show the ketone's adjacent protons. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the two protons adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, in adamantane, the carbons are in a diamondoid structure. If a ketone is formed, perhaps at a bridgehead, then the adjacent CH2 groups would have protons that are deshielded.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group (CH2) next to the carbonyl group.

So, product 1 is 1-adamantanone or similar. Then, moving to reaction 2: product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. What could that do?

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. In some reactions, it can facilitate the formation of enol ethers or other such structures. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is already a ketone.

Wait, but wait, perhaps product 1 is an aldehyde. No, because the IR peak is around 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a methyl ketone. If product 1 is, say, 1-adamantanone, then reaction 2 would do something else.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a more substituted ketone formed by some kind of alkylation. But I'm not sure how aluminum isopropoxide would facilitate that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, which then is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction forms a diketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the subsequent reactions. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond. So, product 1 must be something that after reaction with aluminum isopropoxide forms a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide can help in the formation of enol ethers from ketones. Enol ethers have the structure R-O-CR2=CH2, and they have a double bond adjacent to an oxygen.

So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is the corresponding enol ether.

Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond would be cleaved. Ozonolysis of an enol ether would produce two carbonyl groups.

But wait, in ozonolysis of an enol ether, what happens? Let me think. Ozonolysis of an alkene generally breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. For an enol ether, R-O-CR2=CH2, ozonolysis would break the double bond between the two carbons. But the exact products depend on the substituents.

Wait, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

Let me think about enol ether ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether: R-O-CR2-CH2-CH2-...? No, that's not right. Let me think: an enol ether is R-O-CR2=CH2.

Wait, ozonolysis of R-O-CR2=CH2 would form two carbonyl groups. Specifically, the double bond is between the carbons attached to the oxygen and the adjacent CH2. So ozonolysis would break that double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups: R-O-C(=O) and the other part would be a carbonyl as well.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. For a simple enol ether like CH2=CHO-R, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds: formaldehyde and RCHO.

Wait, but in the case of a more substituted enol ether, like R-O-CR2=CH2, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving R-O-C(=O) and another carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that ozonolysis of an enol ether would produce a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on the structure.

But, I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of an enol ether would lead to the formation of a diketone or other structures.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, and upon ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl compounds. Then product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a ketone adjacent proton, which would be around 2.1 ppm typically, but that's not the most deshielded.

Wait, no. The most deshielded would be the ones next to the carbonyl, perhaps in an aldehyde. But if product 3 has aldehyde groups, then their protons would be around 9-10 ppm and appear as singlets if there are no neighboring H's.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern, not the chemical shift. The most deshielded H would be the aldehyde proton, but those are usually singlets because there are no adjacent H's. However, if it's a ketone, the adjacent H's would couple with neighboring H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the coupling patterns in product 3.

If product 3 has a structure with a carbonyl group and adjacent CH2 groups, the H's on the CH2 would couple with each other and possibly with neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with adjacent CH groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the ozonolysis step. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like R-O-CR2=CH2. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to R-O-C(=O) and something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of product 2 as a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but the exact structure would determine the coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, but that's a stretch.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to approach this differently.

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. The NMR of product 3 is to be considered. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

Assuming that product 3 has a carbonyl group and adjacent H's, the coupling would depend on the number of neighboring H's.

For example, if the H is adjacent to a CH2 group, it would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH group, it would couple with one H, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but the question says "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent." So, perhaps the most deshielded H is not an OH or NH, but something else.

Suppose product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. That CH2 would be split by neighboring groups.

Wait, if it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and next to another CH2, that would lead to coupling with two H's on each side. For example, if it's CH2-CO-CH2-..., then the central CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups on each side, leading to more complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that is adjacent to another CH group. For example, CH2-CH-CO-..., but that's speculative.

Wait, another thought: If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, then ozonolysis would yield two aldehydes, which would have no H's adjacent to the carbonyl. Alternatively, if it's a cyclic diene, ozonolysis might give a diketone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a di-substituted alkene, so ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, each with one R group and maybe some H's.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then, the coupling would depend on the neighboring groups.

If the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, then each H on the central CH2 would couple with four H's (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (pentet).

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, the coupling would be with two H's on each side, so each H on the central CH2 would see four H's (two from each adjacent group). But that's more complex than a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group. For example, CH2-CH(CO)-something. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH and another CH2, then the coupling would be more complex.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 3 as a diketone, with a structure like (CH2)n-CO-CO-(CH2)m. Then, the CH2 groups next to the ketones would have their H's split by the adjacent groups.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a diketone with two CH2 groups next to each ketone, then the H's on those CH2 groups would couple with each other.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CO-CO-CH2, then each CH2 would be next to a CO group. The H's on each CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's H's.

So, each CH2 would have two neighboring H's (from the other CH2), leading to a triplet for each. But wait, considering coupling to both adjacent H's.

Wait, each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about vicinal coupling. Each H on CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the splitting would be due to the two H's on the adjacent group. So each CH2 group's H's would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, the H's on the CH2 next to the CO would be more deshielded than those further away.

Thus, their coupling would be with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. So perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, but another possibility: if the H is adjacent to two different groups, each with two H's, it could lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group next to two different CH2 groups, leading to coupling with two sets of H's, hence a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2, then the central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two H's. So each H on the central CH2 would couple with four H's, leading to a pentet. But that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the CH and the two H's on the next CH2, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H's are adjacent to two different sets of H's, each causing a triplet splitting, the overall pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the earlier reasoning, the most likely scenario is that the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1**  
   - Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely involves elimination reactions. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests that product 1 is a ketone, likely 1-adamantanone or a similar structure.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports this, as the 4.79 ppm peak likely corresponds to protons adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Aluminum Isopropoxide → Product 2**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. However, since product 1 is a ketone, it is more plausible that product 2 is an enol ether formed via enolization. Enol ethers typically have a double bond adjacent to an oxygen atom.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2 → Product 3**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. Since product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond adjacent to oxygen, ozonolysis would break the double bond, resulting in product 3, which likely contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring hydrogens, depending on the structure.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   - If the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This would result in a triplet coupling pattern.  
   - Other possibilities, such as coupling with hydrogens from different groups, would lead to more complex splitting patterns like doublets of triplets or triplets of triplets. However, the simplest and most likely scenario is a triplet.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

**Answer: A**
