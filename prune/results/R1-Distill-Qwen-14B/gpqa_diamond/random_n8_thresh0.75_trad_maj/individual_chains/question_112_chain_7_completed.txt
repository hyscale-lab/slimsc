Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

So, the problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. 

The first part of the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given such that Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Then, we also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. 

The state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The coefficients are 1+i and 2-i.

So, the normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

The magnitude of 1+i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, the magnitude of 2-i is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5).

So the normalization factor N is 1/sqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 ) = 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix A where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So if the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of Sz (spin-z), then the operator A in this basis has elements:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, which are (1,2) and (2,1), they're A12 and A21, both ħ/2. The diagonal elements are zero.

So this operator is actually (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, but Pauli X has ones on the off-diagonal. Oh wait, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) * X.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. So A's eigenstates are the eigenstates of X, which are the eigenstates of S_x (if A is like S_x), but wait, S_x is (ħ/2) X, so if A is (ħ/2) X, then A would have eigenvalues plus and minus ħ/2. Wait, no, because X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So we need to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, it's easier to find its eigenstates and express |alpha> in terms of them.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonals.

The matrix A can be written as:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λI) =0.

So determinant of [ -λ, ħ/2; ħ/2, -λ ] = λ² - (ħ/2)^2 =0.

So λ² = (ħ²)/(4). Thus λ= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now for the eigenvectors.

For λ= ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v =0.

[ -ħ/2 , ħ/2 ] [v1]   =0
[ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] [v2]

So equations: (-λ) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → (- (ħ/2)) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2=0 → v2= v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1]. But we can write them as normalized vectors.

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

[ ħ/2 , ħ/2 ] [v1] =0
[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] [v2]

Which gives (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvectors are proportional to [1, -1].

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ= ħ/2, and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ= -ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Because for λ= ħ/2, the eigenvector was [1,1], which in the basis |up>, |down> is |up> + |down>, so normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2, the eigenvector is [1, -1], which is |up> - |down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

So now, our state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). Let me write it as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

We can express this state in terms of the eigenstates |+> and |->.

Let me write |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So any state can be written as a combination of |+> and |->. Let's find the expansion coefficients c_+ and c_-.

So:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

Substituting the expressions for |+> and |->:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Group like terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

Compare with |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So,

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2)   ...(1)

(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2)   ...(2)

We can solve these equations for c_+ and c_-.

Let me denote equation (1):

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)  ...(1a)

Equation (2):

c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)  ...(2a)

Adding (1a) and (2a):

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting (2a) from (1a):

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_- = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] = 1+i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) ] * sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)) = (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, to find the probabilities, we take |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

(3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) )^2 = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2:

[ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ].

The magnitude squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2)/(4 *7 )

Wait, | (-1 +2i) |^2 is (1 +4 )=5.

So,

5 * (2)/(4 *7) )= (10)/(28) =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, c_- is [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

So the squared magnitude is [ (-1 +2i) ] [ (-1 -2i) ] * (2) / (4 *7 )

= (1 + 4 + 2i - 2i) ) * 2/(28)

Wait, no, that's incorrect. |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So | (-1 +2i)|² = 1 +4=5.

So |c_-|² = [5 * (2)] / (4*7 )= (10)/(28) =5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities for measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively. Let's compute these.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.35714.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36. Hmm, which seems close to 9/14 (0.642857) and 5/14 (0.35714). Option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded, but 5/14 is 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A is 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait another moment. Is there a mistake here? Because the probabilities must add up to 1. 0.64 +0.36 =1.00. 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714. 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714. So when rounded to two decimal places, 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first part of the answer would have probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, which round to 0.64 and 0.36.

Next, the average value of the operator A. The average value is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So <A> = (probability of +ħ/2) * (ħ/2) + (probability of -ħ/2) * (-ħ/2).

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9-5) ħ ]/(28 ) = (4 ħ )/(28 ) = ħ/(7).

Wait, that's ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now let's look at the options. Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait, let's calculate the expectation value another way to verify.

The expectation value can also be calculated as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and |alpha> is normalized as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> can be written as a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)) (1-i) [ top component ] and (1/sqrt(7)) (2 +i) [bottom component ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me represent |alpha> as a vector:

|alpha> = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then <A> = [a* , b* ] A [a; b ]

Compute A [a; b] = [ (0*a) + (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)a + 0*b ] = [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ]

Then [a* b* ] multiplied by that.

So <A> = a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

Compute a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7 = [ (2 -i -2i +i²) ] /7 = [2 -3i -1 ] /7 = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7 = [ (2)(1) + 2i +i +i² ] /7 = [2 +3i -1 ]/7 = (1 +3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ /7.

Yes, that matches what I found before. So the average is ħ/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14 ≈0.357, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7, which fits.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's correct.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix and has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). Its eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

We express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle,
\]

where:

\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2\cdot 7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2\cdot 7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \text{Prob}(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \text{Prob}(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right),
\]

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
