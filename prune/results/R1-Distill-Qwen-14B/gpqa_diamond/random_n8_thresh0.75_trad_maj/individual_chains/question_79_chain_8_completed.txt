Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a reaction. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, looking at the reaction conditions. Compound X is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, it's a strong, bulky base. So if compound X has an epoxide group, this base would induce an acid-base reaction. But wait, epoxide ring opening usually requires an acid or a base. Since this is a base, maybe it's a ring-opening under basic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination reaction. Because the solvent is nonpolar, which might favor elimination over substitution. Hmm. So if compound X is something like an epoxide, perhaps opening it would form a double bond, leading to a diene or something similar. Or wait, maybe it's more about the structure of the product.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR. The signals are at δ 2.28 and 2.31, both singlets, each 3H. Those are likely two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Since the shifts are around 2.2-2.3, maybe they're attached to an electronegative atom or in an environment where splitting is minimal, like being next to an oxygen or something.

Then there are aromatic protons. The signals are at 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, that seems like a pattern of a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think: a doublet at 7.71 (2H), another doublet at 7.08 (2H), and some other doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a styrene group or something with substituents on a benzene ring.

Looking at the 13C NMR: There's a carbon at 197.7, which is a high shift. That's probably a carbonyl group, but wait, 197 is more like a ketone or an aldehyde? Or maybe an ester? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 197 could be a carbonyl from an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the result of ring-opening. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the structure of compound X, not the product. So the product is formed from X via a reaction with this base. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the base opens it, perhaps forming a double bond. Let me think about that.

In epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions, the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide, making an alkoxide which attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon, leading to an elimination of the oxide ion. Wait, no, in basic conditions, the nucleophilic attack would happen, but since the base is bulky, maybe it's a more SN2-like mechanism.

Alternatively, if X is an epoxide, reacting with a base might lead to ring-opening and elimination, forming a double bond. So maybe the product is an alkene, and that's what the NMR is showing.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, but if the product had a carbonyl, that would suggest that maybe X didn't have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide ring-opening leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because epoxide opening typically forms an alcohol or an ether, not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't an epoxide ring-opening but a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe the base is deprotonating something else in the molecule.

Wait, another possibility: if X is an epoxide, and under basic conditions, it's undergoing a ring-opening to form an alcohol. But that would result in an -OH group, which should appear as a broad peak in the 1H NMR. But looking at the product's 1H NMR, there's no such broad peak. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the product. The 1H NMR has aromatic protons. The pattern suggests perhaps a para-substituted benzene, but let's count the signals. There are four signals in the aromatic region: one doublet of 1H, another of 2H, another 1H, and 2H. That could be a substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, maybe it's a trisubstituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a styrene group.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 144.1, which is a quaternary carbon, maybe a carbonyl or part of an aromatic structure. The 141.5 is another quaternary carbon. The 126.9 and 127.1 are around the range for aromatic carbons. So perhaps the product has a styryl group (a vinyl benzene).

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has two doublets each integrating to 2H. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think of a structure. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents on adjacent carbons. Or perhaps it's a meta-substituted. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,3-disubstituted benzene.

Wait, let's try to figure out the splitting. A doublet at 6.75 (1H, d), another at 7.08 (2H, d), then 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm. If we have a benzene ring with substituents that cause the protons to split into these doublets, perhaps it's a 1,2,4-trisubstituted ring? Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted group with another substituent adjacent to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a styrene derivative. Styrene is a vinyl benzene. If the product has a styryl group, that would explain the aromatic signals. Let me think about this.

Wait, but the product is after reaction with a base. So if X is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening, perhaps X is an epoxide adjacent to a carbon that can form a double bond upon ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base that can also act as a catalyst in certain eliminations. So maybe the reaction is an elimination, making a double bond. So if X has an epoxide group and adjacent hydroxyl groups or something, the base could deprotonate and cause the epoxide to open, forming a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclic ether that, upon treatment with a base, undergoes ring-opening to form an alkene. Wait, but that might not fit the NMR data.

Looking at the product's 13C NMR, the peaks: 21.3 and 28.4 are likely methyl groups. Those are low shifts, so perhaps they're attached to something like a methylene or an oxygen. The 21.3 is a singlet, so maybe it's a methyl ester or something like that. Wait, but the 197.7 is a carbonyl, which could be an ester group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that's less likely.

Wait, 197 is a high value; perhaps it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes in 13C NMR are around 190-205, so yes, that could be an aldehyde. But in the 1H NMR, I don't see a peak around 9-10 ppm which is typical for an aldehyde proton. So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Another possibility: a carbonyl from an epoxide ring-opening. Wait, but epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically leads to an alcohol or an ether, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the options given and see if I can figure out which one would lead to the given NMR data upon reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all options are oxiranes except perhaps D. So the starting compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction with the base leads to ring-opening, forming a diol or perhaps a double bond.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, then perhaps it leads to a trans-diol. But the reaction here is with a base, so maybe it's a base-induced ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, leading to a double bond. So if X has an epoxide and adjacent hydroxyl groups, the base could deprotonate and cause the epoxide to open, forming a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the product's NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7, maybe the ring-opening didn't occur, but perhaps it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't an epoxide ring-opening. Could it be something else, like a deprotonation leading to some conjugate addition? Or perhaps the compound is undergoing a elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is a diol with an epoxide group, and under basic conditions, the epoxide is ring-opened to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide that, when treated with a base, undergoes a ring-opening to form a carbonyl via some elimination. Wait, that could form a ketone.

Wait, another approach: let's analyze the NMR data of the product and try to deduce its structure, then figure out what X would be.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- Two singlets at δ 2.28 and 2.31, each 3H. So two methyl groups, probably as substituents on a benzene ring or attached to something else. Since they're singlets, they're not split by neighboring protons, so maybe they're attached to a quaternary carbon.

- Aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Let me try to imagine the structure.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted styrene.

Wait, another thought: the aromatic protons might be part of a benzene ring with substituents that create a coupling pattern. For example, if there's a substituent in the meta position, the protons could be split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the benzene ring has two substituents, each causing doublets.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the aromatic part. The 1H NMR shows 1H as a doublet (6.75), 2H as a doublet (7.08), another 1H as a doublet (7.68), and another 2H as a doublet (7.71). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions, each having a double bond attached. For example, if it's a benzene ring with two substituents at opposite positions, each substituent being an ethyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, but how does that fit with the other signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, leading to three substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, but three substituents would complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, making a styrene, and another substituent.

Wait, let me consider the product's possible structure. If the 13C NMR has signals at 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), and 197.7 (1C, s), that suggests a structure with multiple aromatic carbons, some quaternary carbons, and a carbonyl.

Wait, that carbonyl (197.7 ppm) is a key clue. So the product has a carbonyl group. How could that form from an epoxide?

Hmm. Wait, maybe the epoxide isn't the starting point, but another ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't ring-opening but some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide, causing an elimination and forming a double bond. So X would be an epoxide with adjacent hydroxyl groups, and the base induces elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but then the product would have a double bond, which would show up as a multiplet in the 1H NMR. But in the data, the aromatic signals are prominent, and no obvious alkene protons are seen. Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is part of a substituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene derivative with a carbonyl group. Let me think: if X is an epoxide with a substituent that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a conjugated enone. The presence of a carbonyl and double bonds would explain the NMR. But how would that form from an epoxide?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't ring-opening but a rearrangement. For example, a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but those typically involve 1,5-dienes or other specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound undergoes a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually involves ketones and introduces an oxygen.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A to D. All involve oxirane groups except perhaps D, which is an epoxide. So X is an epoxide, and the reaction leads to a product that's shown in the NMR.

So if X is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening, then the product would have an alcohol group. But the product's NMR doesn't show any broad peaks, which would be characteristic of an -OH group. So perhaps, instead, the reaction leads to elimination, forming an alkene.

So if X is an epoxide with adjacent substituents, the base could deprotonate and cause elimination, forming a double bond. So the product would have a double bond, which might be part of a styrene group.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl. That doesn't fit with a simple elimination. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but the conditions here are basic. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl via oxidation, but that's not indicated by the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Then the carbonyl would make sense. So how would that form from an epoxide? Perhaps via some kind of oxidation, but the reaction conditions don't suggest that. It's just a base and a nonpolar solvent.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a cyclic structure that, upon ring-opening, forms a carbonyl. For example, a five-membered ring with an epoxide that, upon opening, forms a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product's structure is something like a substituted cyclohexenone. Let me think: a six-membered ring with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a steroidal structure, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the product has a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring. Like acetophenone, but with other substituents. Looking at the 1H NMR, the two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 could be two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like para-methylbenzoyl something.

Wait, if the 13C NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7, that's more like a ketone. So perhaps the structure is a para-methylacetophenone derivative.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 4-methylacetophenone. Let me see: the 1H NMR would then have two singlets for the two methyl groups (each 3H), which matches the data. The aromatic protons would be from acetophenone, which is a para-substituted benzene with a ketone.

Wait, acetophenone has a single substituent (the ketone) on the benzene ring, so the aromatic protons would be two doublets (ortho and para to the substituent). Wait, acetophenone's 1H NMR typically shows two doublets for the aromatic protons: one at around 7.4-7.8 ppm (para to the ketone) and another at around 7.5 ppm (ortho). But the given data has four aromatic signals, so that suggests more substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzophenone, but that might complicate the structure.

Wait, another angle: the product's 13C NMR has a carbon at 126.9 (2C, s). That's probably two carbons in a conjugated system, maybe a double bond or aromatic. The 127.1 is another aromatic carbon, and the 129.1 (2C) and 130.3 (1C) suggest a more complex aromatic substitution pattern.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzaldehyde derivative, but then the 1H NMR should show an aldehyde proton. No such peak is present, so that's probably not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of the product after the reaction. Let's consider each option as X and see what the reaction would yield.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an oxirane (epoxide) with a substituent at the 2-position, which is a 4-methylstyryl group (a vinyl benzene where the substituent is at the para position). So the structure would be an epoxide connected to a styryl group.

If X is this structure, and it's treated with a base, what would happen? The base could induce epoxide ring-opening. The ring-opening of an epoxide with a bulky base would typically lead to an SN2 mechanism, where the less hindered carbon is attacked. But the substituents here are a styryl group, which is bulky.

Wait, the epoxide has two adjacent carbons: one connected to the styryl group and the other to the other oxygen. So the ring-opening would depend on the substituents. If the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, the more substituted carbon would be more likely for the nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening leads to a diol, but again, the product's NMR doesn't show peaks for -OH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes an elimination reaction, removing an oxygen and forming a double bond. Wait, but the epoxide already has a double bond. Oh wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring with two adjacent carbons connected by an oxygen. So the two carbons are each connected to the oxygen and another substituent.

Wait, the structure would be like: O connected to two carbons, each also connected to other groups. For 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, the oxirane is a three-membered ring, with one carbon connected to the styryl group and the other connected to another substituent, perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-

No, wait, oxirane is a three-membered cyclic ether with two carbons and one oxygen. So for 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, the two carbons in the epoxide ring are each connected to the oxygen and to the styryl group and another substituent. Wait, no, the substituents would be on one carbon each. Maybe the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2 (but that doesn't seem right). Wait, perhaps the two carbons in the epoxide are each connected to a substituent. For 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, the substituents would be the styryl group on the 2-position and another group on the adjacent carbon. But the molecular formula of X is C11H12O. Let me check.

The formula for option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is C8H7 (since styrene is C8H8, so styryl is C8H7). So oxirane is O plus two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So each carbon in the epoxide is connected to one substituent and the other carbon and the oxygen.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The oxirane ring has two carbons: each is connected to the oxygen and to another group. So for 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, the substituents on the two carbons of the oxirane would be the styryl group and perhaps a hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
C - (styryl group)
|
CH2-

But I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the oxirane is attached to the styryl group at the 2-position, meaning that the epoxide is on a carbon adjacent to the styryl group.

In any case, if X is option A and is treated with a base, perhaps the ring opens, leading to a double bond. For example, the epoxide could open to form a trans-diol, but without acid, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to a conjugate elimination and forming a double bond. So the product would have a double bond where the epoxide was, plus some substituents.

But how would that lead to the product's NMR data, including a carbonyl group?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product's structure. The product has a carbonyl group (197.7 ppm in 13C NMR), two methyl groups (singlets), and a benzene ring with substituents.

So perhaps the product is 4-methylacetophenone. Then, the structure would be a benzene ring with a ketone group (CO) and a methyl group in the para position. The 1H NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups (the COCH3 and another methyl group), but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, the 1H NMR has two singlets, each 3H. So perhaps there are two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like being attached to an oxygen or a quaternary carbon.

Wait, considering the 13C NMR, the 21.3 and 28.4 are probably the two methyl groups. The 21.3 is likely a methyl attached to an oxygen, perhaps part of an acetate group. Wait, but 21 ppm is more like a methyl attached to an oxygen, such as OCH3, but in that case, the 1H would be around δ 3.3 as a singlet. But in the product's 1H NMR, the methyl groups are at δ 2.28 and 2.31, which are more like CH3 attached to a carbon, not an oxygen.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the two methyl groups are adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone like (CH3)2CO, but that's acetone, which has a singlet for the three methyl groups. But in this case, the product has two separate methyl groups as singlets, so perhaps they're on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like 4-methylbenzophenone? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's think about the 13C NMR again. The carbons at 126.9 and 127.1 are two carbons, both singlets. 126.9 is a bit low for aromatic carbons, but perhaps they're part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. The 129.1 and 130.3 are also aromatic carbons.

The 141.5 and 144.1 are quaternary carbons, perhaps carbons attached to the carbonyl or part of the aromatic ring.

The 197.7 is the carbonyl carbon. So perhaps the product is a methyl group attached to a ketone, which is attached to a benzene ring. Let's model this:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH3?

No, that would be a ketone with a propyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-C(O)-CH(CH3)2? But that's probably not matching.

Wait, another idea: the product could be 4-methylacetophenone. Structure: a benzene ring with a ketone group (CO) and a methyl group in the para position. The acetophenone part would have the CO attached to the benzene. The 1H NMR would have two methyl groups: the COCH3 as a singlet around δ 2.6, and another methyl group elsewhere as a singlet. But in the product's data, the methyl groups are at δ 2.28 and 2.31, which is a bit lower than acetophenone's methyl group (which is typically around δ 2.6).

Hmm, maybe it's not acetophenone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-methyl ketone, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-methyl-4-phenylbut-2-enan-2-one. That would have a carbonyl group and a double bond conjugated to the benzene ring. The 1H NMR would show the aromatic protons as a doublet, plus the vinyl protons. But in the data, the aromatic protons are four signals, which doesn't fit.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the NMR. 1H NMR has 6 signals. 13C has 9 signals. So the product has 9 unique carbons. The molecular formula of X is C11H12O. The product's formula? Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation.

For X: C11H12O. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, it's (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: likely a ring (like the oxirane) and maybe a double bond.

The product's formula: same as X? Or different? The reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is likely a base, so it may not add or remove atoms. So the product's formula would be same as X, C11H12O. Wait, but if the reaction is an elimination, perhaps it loses water. Wait, but the product's molecular formula would then be C11H10O. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl, so maybe X had an epoxide and another functional group that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a ring-opening but a rearrangement. Maybe the epoxide undergoes some kind of acid-base induced isomerization.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl group via oxidation, but I don't think the conditions support that.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be a deprotonation leading to a conjugated base, which then rearranges. For example, if X is a bicyclic epoxide, the base could cause a ring-opening followed by a rearrangement forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a conjugated enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a vinyl ketone. So the structure would have a ketone and a double bond adjacent to it. That would explain the carbonyl and the aromatic signals.

But I'm still not making progress. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is an epoxide where one of the carbons is connected to a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the epoxide would be a three-membered ring with one carbon attached to the styryl group and the other connected to another group, perhaps a hydrogen or another substituent.

If X is 2-styrylepoxide, then reacting it with a base might cause ring-opening. If the ring opens, perhaps via SN2, the nucleophile (from the base) would attack the less hindered carbon, leading to an alcohol. But again, the product's NMR doesn't show an -OH peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces elimination, leading to a double bond. But X is already a styryl epoxide; opening it might lead to a conjugated diene or something similar.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but under basic conditions. Maybe the base induces a different pathway. Wait, in basic conditions, the ring-opening of epoxides typically leads to trans-diol formation via SN2 mechanisms. But without an acidic proton, maybe it doesn't proceed.

Wait, but the solvent is nonpolar, which usually favors elimination over substitution. So maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, causing the epoxide to open and form a double bond.

So if X is an epoxide with a styryl group, the elimination would form a longer conjugated system. The product would then have a carbonyl group, perhaps from the elimination.

Wait, but how would that result in a carbonyl? Unless the elimination leads to formation of a carbonyl group via oxidation, but that would require an oxidizing agent, which isn't present here.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the options and their possible products.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the structure is an epoxide where one carbon is attached to a styryl group and the other to a methyl group. Reaction with the base could lead to ring-opening, perhaps forming a trans-diol. But the product's NMR doesn't show OH groups, so maybe elimination occurs instead, forming a double bond.

Wait, so if X is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, and the base induces elimination, perhaps the epoxide opens to form a double bond between the two carbons that were part of the epoxide. So the product would have a double bond between the two ex-epoxide carbons, plus the substituents (styryl and methyl) on adjacent carbons.

That would lead to a conjugated diene? Or perhaps a styryl group with an adjacent double bond.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. So I'm confused again.

Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think about the NMR data again.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone or aldehyde group. Since there's no aldehyde proton in the 1H NMR, it's more likely a ketone.

So the product is a ketone with a benzene ring and two methyl groups. The two methyl groups are singlets, so perhaps they're attached to a quaternary carbon or a carbon that's not next to any other protons.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-methylacetophenone, where the ketone is on the benzene ring, and there's a methyl group in the para position.

But then the 1H NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which the data does have. Let me check:

In acetophenone, the aromatic protons are typically two doublets: one at around 7.4-7.8 (ortho and para to the ketone) and another at around 7.5 (meta). But our data has four signals in the aromatic region. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-methylbenzaldehyde, but as I thought earlier, the 1H NMR lacks an aldehyde peak.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the product's 13C NMR: 141.5 and 144.1 are quaternary carbons. Those could be carbons attached to the carbonyl or part of an aromatic ring.

The 197.7 is the carbonyl. Let's say it's a ketone. Then the structure would have a benzene ring, a ketone group, and two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the product is something like 4-methyl-4-acetophenone. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Another angle: the two methyl groups in the product's 1H NMR are at 2.28 and 2.31. These are close to each other, suggesting they're similar in environment. Maybe they're both attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

For example, in a structure like (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring. But in that case, the acetophenone would have a singlet for the methyl groups, which matches the product's data. But let me check.

Acetophenone's structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3. Its 1H NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 group around δ 2.6. But the product's data shows two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31. So perhaps it's a di-substituted ketone, like (CH3)2C(O)R.

Wait, maybe the structure is diphenylketone with two methyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzophenone with substituents, but that's probably too complex.

Wait, perhaps the product is a result of the base-induced elimination forming a conjugated carbonyl. For example, if X is an epoxide adjacent to a hydroxyl group, elimination would form a double bond and a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure how that would fit with the given NMR.

Another approach: the number of signals in the 1H NMR. The product has 6 signals: two singlets (3H each), and four in the aromatic region. So the structure is probably a para-substituted benzene with substituents that each have protons that split into doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-methylstyryl group with a ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a strong base. So maybe it's abstracting a proton alpha to the epoxide, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond. So X has an epoxide adjacent to a hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination.

Wait, but elimination usually forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless it's an oxidation step, but I don't think that's happening here.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about what each option would look like after reaction.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The structure here would be an oxirane (epoxide) where one of the carbons is connected to a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group. So the substituent is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl group, connected to the epoxide.

If X is this structure and reacts with the base, perhaps the epoxide ring opens, leading to a diol or an elimination product. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure would have the oxirane ring with a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl group on the adjacent carbon.

If the base induces elimination, perhaps the epoxide opens and forms a double bond between the two carbons, leading to a styryl group and a methyl group in conjugation. That would form something like a conjugated diene or a tri-substituted alkene.

But then the product would have a double bond, which in the NMR would show up as a multiplet. The given data doesn't show such a peak, so maybe this is not the case.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The structure is an oxirane with a styryl group attached to one carbon and perhaps a hydrogen on the other. Reacting with the base could lead to ring-opening, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide that has opened to form a carbonyl group. How? Maybe via some rearrangement. For example, the epoxide could undergo a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which moves a substituent from one carbon to an adjacent one, forming a carbonyl. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a result of the base deprotonating a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide, leading to an elimination and formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, maybe the reaction converts the epoxide into a ketone. For example, if X is an epoxide with a CH2 group next to it, the base could cause a cleavage to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves the base-induced cleavage of a 1,2-diol (pinacol) to form a carbonyl compound. But in this case, X is an epoxide, not a diol. So that might not apply.

Wait, unless X is a diol epoxide. So if X has adjacent diol groups and an epoxide, the base could induce cleavage. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a ring-opening but a different kind of elimination. Maybe the base abstracts a proton alpha to the epoxide, leading to a conjugate base which then loses the epoxide as O- and forms a double bond.

But in that case, the product would have a double bond, not a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for the answer by process of elimination.

Looking at the options, the product has a carbonyl group. So which option, when reacted with the base, would form a compound with a carbonyl?

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. If the base opens the epoxide and forms a carbonyl, perhaps via some rearrangement, that could fit. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the product's 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product must have a ketone or aldehyde group. Let me think about each option's structure and what would form upon reaction.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Upon reaction, perhaps the epoxide opens to form a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to a conjugate base that eliminates the epoxide oxygen as O- and forms a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton that's beta to the epoxide, perhaps a hydride shift occurs, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, in the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, a carbocation shifts, but that's under acidic conditions. Not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclic ether that upon ring-opening forms a carbonyl. For instance, a three-membered ring with adjacent substituents that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, here's a thought: if X is an epoxide with a structure where one of the epoxide carbons is attached to a CH2 group, and the other to a phenyl group, the base could abstract a proton from the CH2, leading to an elimination where the epoxide oxygen leaves, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group. So the product would have a carbonyl group.

Ah! So if X is, say, (PhCH2)2O (but that's not an option), the base could cause the elimination to form PhCH2COPh. But that's just an example.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is more likely. Option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, which would have the structure O-C(CH3)-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane ring has two carbons: one connected to a methyl group (C2) and the other connected to a styryl group (C3). So the structure is a three-membered ring with O connected to two CH groups: one CH with a methyl and the other with a styryl.

When treated with a strong base, the base could abstract a proton adjacent to the epoxide. Let's say the proton on the CH connected to the methyl group. Then, the epoxide oxygen would leave, and a double bond would form between the two carbons. So the product would have a double bond where the epoxide was, plus the substituents.

Wait, but that would lead to a trans double bond, and the product would have a structure like CH2=CH- with substituents. But this doesn't directly explain the carbonyl group in the product.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from a carbon adjacent to the epoxide, and the epoxide oxygen leaves, forming a carbonyl group via keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, that might be a possibility. So the product could have a carbonyl group where the epoxide was. So the product would have a ketone group, which fits the 13C NMR.

So if X is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, the reaction could lead to the formation of a ketone via elimination. The product would then have a carbonyl group and a benzene ring, along with the methyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups at 2.28 and 2.31 could be the methyl groups from the product. One from the original methyl substituent and another perhaps from the base's solvent or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is same as X? X is C11H12O. If the product loses H2O (from epoxide opening), then the product would be C11H10O. But the NMR data suggests a carbonyl, which would require an oxygen. So perhaps the product has the same formula as X.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The presence of a carbonyl in the product suggests that the starting compound must have a structure that can form a carbonyl upon reaction. Among the options, option C has a methyl group and a styryl group, which could lead to a product with a carbonyl after elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a nucleophilic attack. The base could attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and forming an alcohol. But without an -OH in the NMR, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the structure of the epoxide. If X is 2-styrylepoxide (option D), then the product after ring-opening could form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, the base could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide, leading to a conjugated base that forms a carbonyl upon elimination of the epoxide oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for another approach. The product's 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups. So perhaps those are two methyl groups attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a structure like (CH3)2CO.

So the product might be something like 4-methylacetophenone, which would have a benzene ring with a ketone and a methyl group in the para position. The 1H NMR would have the two methyl groups as singlets (from the ketone and another group), and the aromatic protons as a doublet.

Wait, but in the product's data, the aromatic region has four signals. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene with another substituent creating a meta effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted acetophenone with another substituent.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. I think I'll have to conclude based on the options and the data. The product has a carbonyl, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring. The most likely option for X is the one that, upon reaction, would form such a product.

Looking back, option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. If the base induces elimination, perhaps the epoxide opens to form a double bond and a carbonyl group. So the product would have a structure with a carbonyl group adjacent to a benzene ring and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has a carbon at 28.4, which is a singlet. That's around the range for a CH2 or CH3 group attached to something. So in the product, that could be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Because upon reaction with the base, it could form a product with a carbonyl group, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring as described.


The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K. The reaction conditions suggest a base-induced transformation, likely involving elimination or rearrangement. The product's NMR data reveals the following key features:

1. **1H NMR**: Two singlets at δ 2.28 and 2.31 (3H each), indicating two methyl groups in a symmetric or non-splitting environment. The aromatic region shows four signals: δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d), consistent with a substituted benzene ring.
2. **13C NMR**: A carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7, two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 and 28.4, and several aromatic carbons. The quaternary carbons at δ 141.5 and 144.1 suggest a complex aromatic substitution pattern.

The reaction likely involves the opening of an epoxide group in Compound X, leading to a product with a carbonyl group, aromatic protons, and two methyl groups. The analysis of the options is as follows:

- **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)**: This structure has an epoxide ring with a 4-methylstyryl substituent. Reaction with the base could lead to ring-opening, but it is unlikely to form a product with a carbonyl group as observed in the NMR data.
  
- **Option B (2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane)**: This structure involves an epoxide ring with a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl substituent. While the base could induce elimination, this structure does not readily explain the formation of a carbonyl group in the product.

- **Option C (2-methyl-3-styryloxirane)**: This structure has an epoxide ring with a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl group on the adjacent carbon. The base could induce elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. This aligns with the product's NMR data, which shows a carbonyl at δ 197.7, two methyl groups, and aromatic protons consistent with a substituted benzene ring.

- **Option D (2-styrylepoxide)**: This structure has an epoxide ring with a styryl group. While the base could induce ring-opening, this structure does not readily explain the formation of a carbonyl group in the product.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible structure for Compound X is **2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (Option C)**. The reaction with the base likely leads to elimination, forming a product with a carbonyl group, two methyl groups, and a substituted benzene ring, consistent with the given NMR data.

Answer: C
