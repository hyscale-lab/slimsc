Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question involves several reactions starting from compound A, leading all the way to compound D. I'll need to figure out the structure of each compound along the way to determine what D is.

First, the problem states that compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us the number of protons. So 6H and 4H here.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely from a methyl group (CH3) because that's a common region. The quartet at 1.3 ppm could be from a methylene group (CH2) next to another CH2. Wait, because a quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's a CH2 next to another CH2, that makes sense. Like maybe a (CH2)2 group.

Putting that together, maybe compound A has two methyl groups and a (CH2)2 group. Wait, but the integration is 6H for the triplet. So if each CH3 has 3H, then 6H would be two CH3 groups. So two methyl groups. And the quartet is 4H, which is two CH2 groups, each with 2H. So maybe something like (CH2)2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, that might not fit. Or perhaps it's a structure where two methyl groups are attached to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. Maybe compound A is 2,2-dimethylbutane? No, wait, let me sketch this. 2,2-dimethylbutane would have a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2CH2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl ether or something else, but no, because the NMR doesn't show any other signals.

Wait, another thought: the triplet (6H) and quartet (4H). Maybe it's neopentane? No, because neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would give a singlet for the central C and a triplet for the CH2 groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it
