Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific aromatic compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to get a clearer picture. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait. Let me think about the numbering. The positions are given as 2, 1, and 3, but wait, in benzene, numbering is such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Hmm, but maybe it's better to think in terms of meta, para, ortho positions.

Wait, wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1,2,3 are in a row? Because 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions of the benzene ring.

Let me list the substituents:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)
- Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
- Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)

Hmm, so substituents are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each other. Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1,2,3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So, the substitu
