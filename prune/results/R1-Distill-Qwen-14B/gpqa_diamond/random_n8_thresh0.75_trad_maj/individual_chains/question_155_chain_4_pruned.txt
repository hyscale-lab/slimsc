Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually when we talk about the basis, we use the eigenstates of an operator, often the Hamiltonian or another observable. 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² ). So I'll need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. To compute these, I first need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared. 

Since P_z is given as a matrix, I can compute these by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector (bra) multiplied by P_z (and P_z squared) acting on the state vector (ket).

Wait, but wait again. The state is given as a column vector. Let me write down the matrices to make it clear.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

But wait, the state vector is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So each basis vector corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z. That probably simplifies things because when you express the state in this basis, the components are the projections onto each eigenstate.

The state vector |ψ> is [ -1/2,
