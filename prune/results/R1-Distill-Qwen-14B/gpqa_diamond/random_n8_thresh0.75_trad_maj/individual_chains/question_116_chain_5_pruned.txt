Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question starts with compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us about the number of equivalent protons. So, 6H in a triplet and 4H in a quartet.

Wait, what structures have that kind of splitting? The triplet and quartet suggest some coupling between different sets of protons. A common scenario is when you have two adjacent groups of protons. For example, maybe a (CH3)2CH group or something similar.

Let me think about the triplet. 6H as a triplet. That could be two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would couple with the adjacent CH2, which has two protons. So each CH3 would split into a triplet. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH3 group, but the integration doesn't fit that.

Wait, wait. Let's think about possible structures for compound A. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) is usually indicative of two methyl groups next to a CH2. Because each methyl (3H) would couple with the adjacent CH2 (2H), so each CH3 gives a triplet. But wait, 6H in totalâ€”so two CH3 groups. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2-something. Or perhaps a cyclohexane derivative? Hmm, not sure yet.

Oh, wait. Another possibility: maybe the triplet is from two equivalent methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. So, for example, (CH3)2CHCH2CH2... But wait, let's think about the quartet. 4H as a quartet, which could be a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, the splitting for a quartet could be from a CH2 adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons. Or perhaps it's a CH2 that's next to a CH group that has two neighboring protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclopropane? No, that might not fit. Let's think of a simpler scenario.

Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group. Like CH2CH2CH3. Oh, wait, no, that's the ethyl group. Alternatively, maybe a diethyl ether or something else
