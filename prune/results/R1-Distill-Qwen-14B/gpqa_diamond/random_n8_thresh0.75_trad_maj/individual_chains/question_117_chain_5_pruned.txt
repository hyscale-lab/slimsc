Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds show this property. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. When a molecule has one or more chiral centers, it can have stereoisomers, which might be enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to check each for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism (cis-trans) but wait, geometric isomerism is about double bonds, not optical activity. Oh, wait, unless the question is about any kind of stereoisomerism, but the question specifically asks about optical isomerism. So, which compounds have chiral centers or some form that allows them to be optically active.

Let's go through each one:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate

Biphenyl structures can have axial chirality because the two phenyl rings are connected and can have different substituents in positions that lead to different arrangements. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions. Let me visualize. So, the biphenyl has two nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions and two carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. 

Since the substituents are symmetrical in a way, but wait, wait. Wait, 1,1'-biphenyl means the two benzene rings are connected at position 1 of each. So the substituents at 2 and 2' are both on the same side of each ring. But in this compound, are there any chiral centers? Or is it more about the possibility of the biphenyl having a plane of symmetry? Alternatively, the substituents might make the molecule chiral.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which requires the presence of a chiral center or a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe in biphenyls, if there are four different substituents around the central bond, they can exhibit axial chirality.

Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at C1. Now, the substituents at 6 and 6' are nitro groups, and 2 and 2' are the ester groups. Let me
