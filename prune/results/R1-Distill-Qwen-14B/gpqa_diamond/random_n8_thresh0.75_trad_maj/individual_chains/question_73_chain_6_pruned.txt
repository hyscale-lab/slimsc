Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh wait, right! You have to use the velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally.

Wait, but wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. Let me recall the formula. Oh yeah, the relativistic velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, which one is u and which is v? Because one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c.

Wait, wait. Oh, if astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So the relative speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame would be (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²). Let me plug in the numbers.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let's compute numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) → 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So denominator is 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Oh, so approximately 0.14c, right? Because 1/7 is about 0.1428.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c, and D has the same. So that's part one.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². But wait, the astronauts have different masses. So I need to compute each energy and sum them.

Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So their rest energies are 2m c² and 3m c². But wait, no, when you're moving at high speeds, the total energy is gamma * m_rest * c². So for each astronaut, I need to calculate gamma for their respective speeds and multiply by their rest mass energy.

So first, astronaut 1: mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. Compute gamma for 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = 0.6c
