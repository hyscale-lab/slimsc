Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The person is trying to overexpress GADD45G by introducing a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, but the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

The problem is that the construct's plus strand sequence is provided, and the issue is somewhere in that sequence. The options suggest various possible issues.

Let me look at the options first to see what each is about.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So that would mean the HA tag isn't correct, maybe leading to improper folding or recognition. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If it's a missense, perhaps the tag isn't functional, but does that prevent expression? I'm not sureâ€”maybe it's more about purification, but the question says they couldn't overexpress, which might be a transcription or translation issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would be a premature stop codon. So the mRNA might have a stop codon early in the sequence, causing the ribosome to stop before the protein is made. But looking at the sequence, the last part is a termination codon. Let me scan the provided sequence for any in-frame stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA). Let me look through the sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's see if any stop codons are present before the end. I'll go through the sequence in triplets:

Looking through the sequence, I note that towards the end, I see "TGA" near the end. Let me check. The sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So, the last part is GAG TGA. Wait, the TGA is a stop codon. But wait, the reading frame matters. Let me see the exact end.

Looking at the plus strand, the last few nucleotides are TGA. So in the mRNA, it's UGA. So that's a stop codon, UGA. But where is it? Let me count the bases.

Wait, the entire sequence is provided, so the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (which is glutamic acid) and then TGA. Hmm, but the stop codon comes after the GAG. Oh wait, wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template, but the plus strand is the same as mRNA except T for U. So the sequence is 5' to 3', which is the same as mRNA. So the stop codon is UGA, which is a termination signal.

Wait, but if the coding sequence ends with a stop codon, that's normal. But perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong place. Let me see, does the HA tag come before the GADD45G sequence? So the construct is HA-GADD45G. So the coding sequence should start with the HA tag, then GADD45G, and end with the stop codon.

Wait, the provided plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the next few nucleotides are TAC, which is Tyr. But wait, the HA tag is a peptide from the influenza virus. The HA tag is usually a small peptide, like YPYDVPDYA, but in terms of the coding sequence, it's a short DNA sequence. So perhaps the initial part of the construct should include the HA tag coding before the GADD45G starts.

But looking at the provided sequence, it starts with ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), then CCATACGATGTTCC etc. Wait, HA is a short sequence, so maybe the initial part is the HA coding, but in this case, the sequence starts with
