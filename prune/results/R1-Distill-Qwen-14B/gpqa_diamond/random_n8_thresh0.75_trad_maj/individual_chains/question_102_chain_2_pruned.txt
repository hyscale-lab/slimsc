Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques and gene expression vectors. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a bicistronic vector, which I remember means it has two genes or ORFs in one construct. The setup involves a ligand and a receptor. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

So, the vector has some regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. I know that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate transcript, maybe under a different promoter or in a different way. 

Looking at the stop cassettes: between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that these loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. 

The person made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning their loading control worked. But when they look for the fluorescent signals in mice, the green (eGFP) isn't visible. So the issue isn't with the Western blot, because the proteins were expressed enough, but maybe the GFP isn't being expressed in the right place or at the right time.

The mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre is used to excise certain DNA sequences. The offspring would have the Cre recombinase active, which probably is supposed to remove the stop cassettes.

Wait, the vector has two different lox sitesâ€”loxP and lox2272. Cre from the SOX10-Cre would recognize loxP sites but not lox2272, I think. Because the lox2272 is a variant that isn't cut by wild-type Cre. So, if the Cre is only able to cut loxP, then the ligand's stop cassette (loxP) would be removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) would remain, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed. So the eGFP would not be expressed either. 

Alternatively, the setup could be that the Cre is supposed to delete both stop cassettes, but if the Cre only recognizes one, only one gene would be expressed. 

Wait, what's the standard setup for bicistronic vectors with loxP cassettes? Usually, the vector would have a front loxP-stop for the first gene, and a back loxP or another site for the second. But in this case, the ligand has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. 

If the Cre used only targets loxP, then the ligand would be expressed (since its stop is removed), but the receptor's stop would remain because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain why the green signal isn't observed. 

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean a frameshift, so not expressed correctly. But I think the stop cassettes are about expression, not frame. If the stop was in frame, it would terminate translation early. So the stop is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. If the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in frame, meaning they can be translated together. If the stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed alone, and eGFP isn't. 

Wait, the problem says the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it
