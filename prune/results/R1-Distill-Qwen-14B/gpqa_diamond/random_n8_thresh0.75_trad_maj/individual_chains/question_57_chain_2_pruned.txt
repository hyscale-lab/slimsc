Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are all in femtometers, which makes sense because scattering amplitudes are usually measured in those units.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum from l=0 to infinity of ( (2l+1) * Pl(cosθ) * e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) ). But since we're to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, only the given ones (l=0 to 4) are considered.

Oh, wait, the problem says to ignore the rest, so l goes from 0 to 4. Each term has a phase shift δ_l. The imaginary part of f(θ) along the beam direction would be when θ=0 degrees because that's the direction of the incident beam.

So when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomial Pl(1) is 1 for all l. So each term simplifies a lot. The sum becomes sum from l=0 to 4 of ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} - 1 ), all multiplied by 1/(2ik).

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of f(θ=0). So I need to compute the imaginary part of this sum. Let's break it down.

First, I think the formula for the imaginary part would be just the imaginary part of each term in the sum. So, for each l, compute the imaginary part of ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} - 1 ). Sum those up, then multiply by 1/(2ik).

Wait, but what's k? The wave number. Oh right, k is related to the energy. The electrons are 50 MeV. But wait, what's the relation between energy and k? For electrons, the energy E is relativistic. The formula for k is (sqrt( (E)^2 - m_e^2 c^4 )) / (ħ c). Hmm, but maybe I can approximate or use a simpler expression if the energy is high. Wait, 50 MeV is a lot, so maybe E >> m_e c
