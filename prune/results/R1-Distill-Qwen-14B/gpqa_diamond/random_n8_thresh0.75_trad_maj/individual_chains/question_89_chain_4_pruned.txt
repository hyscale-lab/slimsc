Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, first, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? It's like a bridged bicyclic compound. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3. 

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. Since it's a dihalide, especially vicinal dihalide (if the bromines are adjacent), I'm thinking elimination reaction. But wait, is it a vicinal dihalide? 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3. Depending on the structure of adamantane, are those positions adjacent? Hmm. Oh wait, adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent, but perhaps on bridgehead positions. Wait, but in any case, when heated with KOH, elimination is likely. 

Wait, KOH and a dihalide would typically undergo dehydrohalogenation, leading to an elimination to form an alkene. But wait, in this case, since it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide leading to elimination of two equivalents of HBr and forming a double bond. But wait, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, that's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond. But wait, if they're not adjacent, maybe another mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe it's a debromination. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. But let's think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which is probably from an oxygen-containing group, maybe an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for an alcohol OH, but more likely an ether. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group? Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone or maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR absorption at 1720 is a strong peak, which could correspond to an ester (around 1740-1720) or a ketone (around 1700-1750, but more like 1700). Wait, no, wait: Esters are higher, around 1740, ketones around 1700, maybe? So 1720 is somewhere in between. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen, maybe an OCH₂ group. Then, the 2.41-2.23 ppm region integrates to 10H, which suggests a lot of equivalent protons
