Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its NMR data after a reaction. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

First, I should probably think about what reaction conditions are given. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I think it's a bulky, non-nucleophilic base. Oh wait, and it's often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, like maybe the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides or maybe some kind of elimination. Wait, but wait, the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K, which is around 130Â°C, so maybe it's a reaction that requires heat.

Wait, but Compound X is reacting with this base. So what kind of reaction would happen under such conditions? One possibility is the ring-opening of an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe a rearrangement, like a Cope elimination or something else, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, all of them seem to be oxiranes, which are epoxides. So maybe the reaction is opening an epoxide. But wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, so perhaps it's abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, leading to ring opening via a base-catalyzed mechanism. But that could form an alkoxide, which might then lead to some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is an acid-catalyzed opening, but the base here is more likely to deprotonate something. Hmm. So, maybe the epoxide ring opens under basic conditions. But then, what happens after that?

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but maybe the product is something else. Alternatively, is there another reaction happening, like a rearrangement?

Wait, but looking at the options, all are oxiranes except perhaps some substitution. Wait no, the options are
