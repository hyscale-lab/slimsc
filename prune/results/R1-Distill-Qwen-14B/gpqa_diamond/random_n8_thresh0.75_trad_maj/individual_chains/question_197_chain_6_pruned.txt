Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

Alright, first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let me look at the spectral data given. 

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates an -OH stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an alcohol. But wait, 3400–2500 could also be due to an amine N-H stretch, but the other peaks might give more clues. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl group. That's likely a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Also, there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the ¹H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Because the broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's usually a singlet, but sometimes a triplet if coupled. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, looking at the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. A carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits. The O-H in a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, so that also fits. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then, the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and as a doublet, so perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring. But wait, the integration is 2H each for the two doublets. So, each doublet is two protons, but wait, for a benzene ring, each of the two adjacent protons would be a doublet. Wait, no, for para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each ortho and meta to each substituent. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of two protons each as doublets. So that fits.

Then, looking at the rest of the NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH next to an electronegative atom, like a carbonyl. So perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons in a multiplet, maybe part of a chain, like a CH2 group adjacent to
