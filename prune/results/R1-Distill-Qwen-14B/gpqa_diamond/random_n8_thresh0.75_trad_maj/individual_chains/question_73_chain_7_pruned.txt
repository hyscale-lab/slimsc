Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the formulas perfectly, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving different values for v_rel and E.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light), you can't just subtract the speeds normally because that would give an answer over c, which isn't possible. So, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity, if one object is moving at u and the other at v relative to the same frame, is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so I guess I have to find how one sees the other moving. Let's clarify: the question is about the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c in the same direction. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, the numerator is 0.1c, and the denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So the relative speed part is either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. So for each astronaut, the total energy is gamma * m c squared, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^
