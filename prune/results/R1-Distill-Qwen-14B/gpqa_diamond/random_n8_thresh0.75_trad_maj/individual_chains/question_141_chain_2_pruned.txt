Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure here.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, that's probably 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium somewhere. Oh, right, the "d" indicates a deuterium. So, the structure must have a bromine and a deuterium attached to the benzene ring. Let me visualize this. The benzene ring has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So it's like bromine in the para position relative to deuterium, or wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 and 2 are adjacent, so they are ortho to each other. So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh, right, that's a strong base and a good nucleophile. I'm thinking elimination maybe, since NaNH2 is a strong base. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the bromine is attached to the benzene, making it a bromobenzene derivative. But wait, benzene is generally pretty stable. So, how does the reaction proceed?

Wait, perhaps this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, but wait, benzene is aromatic. Oh, wait, but if the molecule is bromobenzene, and we have a base, maybe it's more about aromatic substitution? Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, but for aromatic substitution, you usually have something like a meta-directing group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about something else. Oh, wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, but that's usually for aliphatic halides. Like, for example
