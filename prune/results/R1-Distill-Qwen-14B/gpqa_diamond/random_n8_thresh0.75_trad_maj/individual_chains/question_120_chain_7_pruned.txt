Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky relative to distant background stars as Earth orbits the Sun. The formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's closer would have a larger parallax, and a more distant star would have a smaller parallax.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant, right? So if I imagine the universe as a three-dimensional space, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But wait, how does that translate to parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is 1/d. But when considering a range of parallaxes, I think we're dealing with a range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. Each of these plx values corresponds to a distance d = 1/plx.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So how many stars are there when you go from, say, plx to plx + delta_plx. Let's think in terms of volume.

The number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume V is proportional to V.

But how does that volume relate to plx? Oh right, because plx is inversely proportional to distance, we can think about a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness delta_d. The volume of such a shell is 4πd² delta_d. But wait, we're looking at a range in plx, which is a change in d.

Since plx = 1/d, a change in plx (delta_plx) would correspond to a change in d. Let me express delta_d in terms of delta_plx. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: delta_d = - (1/plx²) * delta_plx. But since we're dealing with absolute values, the negative sign can be ignored. So delta_d ≈ (1/plx²) * delta_plx.

But the volume of the shell is 4πd² delta_d. Substituting d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx²)² * (delta_d). Wait, no, wait. Let's do this step by step.

Wait, the shell's radius is d, so volume is 4πd² delta_d. And delta_d is (1/plx²) delta_plx, from earlier. So substituting, volume = 4π*(1/plx²)² * (delta_plx / plx²) )? Wait, no. Wait, delta_d is (1/plx²) * delta_plx. So volume is 4π*(1/plx)² * (delta_d) = 4π*(1/plx²) * (delta_plx / plx²). So 4π delta_plx / (plx^4).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So plx = d^-1. Then, the derivative d plx = -d^{-2} dd. So delta_plx ≈ -(1/d²) delta_d. Rearranging, delta_d ≈ -d² delta_plx. But since d is positive, delta_d is proportional to d² delta_plx. Wait, so delta_d = (d^2) delta_plx. But d is 1/plx, so delta_d = (1/plx²) delta_plx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π d² delta_d = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta_plx / plx²). So 4π delta_plx / plx^4.

Wait, but the number
