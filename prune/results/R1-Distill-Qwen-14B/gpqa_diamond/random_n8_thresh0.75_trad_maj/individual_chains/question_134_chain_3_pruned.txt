Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions are when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). Oh wait, but sometimes people use different units, so I need to pay attention to that.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, I need to figure out how much each acid and base contributes to the reaction. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So they'll all react completely.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each reactant. Because moles will determine how much of each acid and base is available to react.

Let me get the formula right for moles. Moles = concentration (M) Ã— volume (L). Oh yeah, because Molarity is moles per liter.

So, let's calculate each one.

First, HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Its concentration is 0.2 M. So moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Concentration is 0.5 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, right? Each mole provides two OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So
