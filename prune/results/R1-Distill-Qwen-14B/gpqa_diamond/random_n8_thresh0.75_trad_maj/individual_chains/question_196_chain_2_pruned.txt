Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but now it's relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play.

The problem states that the mass is m, the maximum amplitude is A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, each with different expressions.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, which is one of the choices. But wait, this is a relativistic oscillator, so I can't use that directly.

Relativity comes in when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I probably need to consider the relativistic energy equations. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (1/2)mv² in classical terms. But relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but the oscillator is such that when the mass is at maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is maximum. Conversely, at the equilibrium position (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, maybe the total energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential but includes the rest mass energy as well. So, perhaps the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, no, that might not be right. The relativistic energy includes kinetic and potential. Let me think. For the harmonic oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². So, the total energy should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy
