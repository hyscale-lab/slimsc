Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on uncertainties, but I think I can work through it.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩ − ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩². Right, so I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh wait, I should make sure if this is a normalized vector. Let me check: the sum of the squares of the elements is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is |ψ>, which is a column vector, I can compute this by ψ† P_z ψ. Let me write down P_z's matrix.

P_z matrix given is:
[ ħ   0     0   ]
[ 0   0     0   ]
[ 0   0   -ħ ]

So ψ is a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

So ψ† is the row vector: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

Now, ψ† P_z ψ is the dot product of ψ with P_z ψ. Let me compute P_z ψ first.

P_z acting on ψ:
- First component: ħ*(-1/2) = -ħ/2
- Second component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0
- Third component: -ħ*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2; 0; ħ/2 ]

Now, ψ† multiplied by this vector: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:
First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4
Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4
Wait, no. Wait, (-1/2) * (-ħ/2) is ħ/4, and (-1/2) * (ħ/2) is -ħ/4. Oh wait, no:

Wait, no, the first term is (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) = (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

The third term is (-1/2)*(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

So sum is ħ/4 + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements.

P_z squared matrix is:
[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (−ħ)^2 ] → which is ħ².

So P_z² is:
[ ħ²  0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0   ħ² ]

So ψ† P_z² ψ is the same as ψ† multiplied by P_z² ψ.

Compute P_z² ψ:
First component: ħ²*(-1/2) = -ħ²/2
Second component: 0
Third component: ħ²*(-1/2) = -ħ²/2

So P_z² ψ = [ -ħ²/2; 0; -ħ²/2 ]

Now, ψ† times this vector:

(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2)

Which is (1/2)(ħ²/2) + 0 + (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistake in the matrix multiplications?

Wait, when I calculated P_z ψ, the third component was -ħ*(-1/2) which is ħ/2. So when I compute ψ† P_z ψ, it's (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/2)(ħ/2). So that's (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

For P_z², the first component is (ħ^2)*(-1/2), which is -ħ²/2. Third component is (ħ^2)*(-1/2) which is -ħ²/2. So when I take ψ† times P_z² ψ, that's (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2). So each term is (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4, and since both are positive
