Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200 cm³, and it contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three Ka values for H3PO4: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Orthophosphate ions, I think, are the HPO4^2- form. Wait, no, wait. Wait, H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. It can lose protons in three steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right?

But wait, looking at the substances in the solution: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and
