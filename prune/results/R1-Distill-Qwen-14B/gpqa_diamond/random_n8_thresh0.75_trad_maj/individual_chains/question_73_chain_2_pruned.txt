Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if you're on a train moving at 0.6c and throw a ball forward, the ball's speed relative to the ground isn't just 0.6c + some speed. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula here.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)) right? Because both are moving in the same direction. Oh wait, actually, since both are moving in the positive x, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by that factor. So the faster one is 0.6c, the slower is 0.5c, so their relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate the denominator first. (0.6*0.5)c² is 0.3c², and over c squared is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. That would match option C or D's relative speed.

Now, the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². So I need to calculate the gamma for each and sum the energies.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute gamma for each astronaut.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. His mass is 2m, so his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. His mass is 3m. So energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. When calculating relative velocity, it's (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, v1 is the speed of the first astronaut as seen from the second's frame, or vice versa? Or does it not matter because it's the same formula. Wait, wait, according to the formula, if you have two frames moving at u and v relative to the lab, the relative speed between them is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the second's perspective, the first is moving at (0.6 - 0.5)/(1 -
