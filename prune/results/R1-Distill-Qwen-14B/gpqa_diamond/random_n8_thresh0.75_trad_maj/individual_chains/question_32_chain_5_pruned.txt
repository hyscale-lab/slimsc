Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li normally has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the mass of the nucleus is important here. For heavy ions, the mass is approximately that of a single nucleon multiplied by A. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So the rest mass of the nucleus X would be A times that. Let me compute that. A is 6, so 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but wait, when dealing with relativistic particles, the rest mass is just m, but the total energy would involve gamma multiplied by m c squared. But since c is a constant, in the units we're using, we can treat m as 5.628 GeV/c².

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c.

Wait, relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m * c². But when calculating the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1) m c². Oh wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think RHIC's energy refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei. But sometimes in particle physics, the total energy is given, including rest mass. I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the collider." Typically, colliders provide kinetic energy to the particles. So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, E = K + m c². But sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy as the energy delivered by the collider. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

In high-energy physics, often when they say the energy of the collider, they refer to the kinetic energy per particle. Wait, but sometimes they list the total energy. So I better make sure which one is the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the total energy, E, not the kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps they're referring to the total energy, because the speed would relate to the total energy. Because the speed is a function of the total energy, which includes gamma.

So, to proceed, I'll calculate the total energy E = gamma * m c². Once I find gamma, multiply it by the rest mass energy.

So, first, I'll find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute beta = v/c = 0.96.

So beta = 0.96. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784) = let's see, 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait
