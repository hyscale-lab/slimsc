Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one  
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing two compounds.

Hmm, okay. I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but they might be used in different contexts. Wait, BH3 is typically used as a reagent in the hydroboration reaction, while LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, especially for carbonyl groups. Oh wait, but wait—LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Oh, but wait, in some cases, like for ketones, both might be used for reduction. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, wait—maybe I'm confusing something. Oh right, BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds across a double bond in a specific way, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition. But when it's used in the presence of something else, like in the formation of alcohols from ketones, does it do that? Or is that LiAlH4?

Wait, no. Typically, BH3 is used for hydroboration, and LiBH4 is used for reducing carbonyls. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, amides, etc., while BH3 is more selective. Oh wait, but in the problem, the product is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, because the product is a ketone—so maybe the starting material is some sort of carbonyl compound.

Wait, no. Because LiBH4 usually reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) into alcohols. So if the product is a ketone, that's confusing. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or a different carbonyl compound. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.
