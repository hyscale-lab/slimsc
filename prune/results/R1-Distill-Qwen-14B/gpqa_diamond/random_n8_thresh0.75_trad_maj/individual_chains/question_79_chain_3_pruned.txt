Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, the reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh, right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the cleavage of epoxides, right? It's often used in the ring-opening of epoxides under certain conditions. So, if compound X is reacting with this base, maybe X is an epoxide?

The product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, the 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each, probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them. Then there are four aromatic protons. Let me think; the aromatic signals look like they might be from a substituted benzene ring. Let's see, the triplet at 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted styrene or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- δ 21.3 (s, 1C)
- δ 28.4 (s, 1C)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

The high value at 197.7 is probably a carbonyl group. Wait, but epoxide rings don't have carbonyls. Oh, wait, unless it's an ester or ketone. Hmm, but the reaction is with a base, so maybe the epoxide ring has opened. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is X, and the reaction is with a base. So if X is an epoxide, reacting with a base like this could lead to ring opening. But the
