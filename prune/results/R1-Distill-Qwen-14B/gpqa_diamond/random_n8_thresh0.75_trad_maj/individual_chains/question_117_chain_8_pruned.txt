Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the given moieties show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, right, that's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Remember, a chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. So, if any of the compounds have such centers, they can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I'll go through each one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, this sounds complex. Let me break it down. It's a biphenyl group, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6. The groups are dimethyl, nitro, and carboxylate. Since biphenyls can have restricted rotation around the central bond, especially if the substituents are in positions that don't allow free rotation, this could lead to cis-trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism. Wait, no, because for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. So does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me think. The central carbon in each ester group is O-C-O. Wait, no, the ester is O-C-O, but the actual structure is maybe each phenyl has a substituent, but are there any carbons attached to four different groups? The central biphenyl might have substituents, but each substituent is a nitro group, a carboxylate ester (like OMe), and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each phenyl. So on each benzene ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Hmm, but the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is probably connecting two phenyl groups, but unless there are other substituents, it might not be a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps each ester group is attached to the phenyl, but each of those is OMe, so the carbonyl groups maybe have substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: if the molecule has a plane
