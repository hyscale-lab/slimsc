Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's read it again to make sure I understand it.

The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Hmm. I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where the underlying laws (the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. The particles that come out of this are called 'Nambu-Goldstone' bosons. These bosons are massless in the symmetry-preserving case but can acquire mass when the symmetry breaks. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Nambu-Goldstone bosons are massless, but in some cases, like in the Higgs mechanism, they can become massive. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the particles in the options: let's think about each one.

Phonon (A): Phonons are quantized sound waves, right? They arise from the quantization of the vibrations in a crystal lattice. The underlying symmetry here, I think, is related to the translation symmetry of the crystal. When the crystal has a periodic structure, the translational symmetry is broken except for the lattice vectors. So phonons are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry, but I'm not sure if it's spontaneous symmetry breaking. Wait, wait. No, phonons are more about the quantized vibrations in a solid. The solid's symmetry is broken from the perfect symmetry of a fluid, perhaps. Oh wait, in a perfect crystal, each site is the same, but when you have a lattice, there
