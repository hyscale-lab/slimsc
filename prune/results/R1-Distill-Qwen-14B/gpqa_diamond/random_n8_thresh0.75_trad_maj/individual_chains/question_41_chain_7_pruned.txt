Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says there's a light beam moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by n. But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light inside it? Or is it different because the medium itself is moving?

In the case of a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that change things? I think this is related to the concept of relativity, but maybe not special relativity because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Or wait, no, the medium is glass here, which is a material, so perhaps the speed of light in the glass is still c/n, but then we have to consider the glass's motion.

Wait, maybe I should think about the observer's frame. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So from the lab frame, the glass's velocity is v. The light is moving through the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But what's its speed relative to the lab?

Wait, I think the speed of the light as observed in the lab depends on the velocity of the medium. Oh wait, no. Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait
