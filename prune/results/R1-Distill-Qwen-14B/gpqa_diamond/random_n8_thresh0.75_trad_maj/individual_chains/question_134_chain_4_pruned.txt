Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change, and the options are given in kcal and kJ. Wait, the units are mixed, but maybe the calculation will sort that out.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. I think when they react, they'll go to completion.

Let me list all the steps.

Step 1: Calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.
HCl is a strong acid, so each mole contributes one H+. So for HCl: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L is 0.1 moles of HCl, which gives 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, which means each mole gives two H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each contributes two H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Step 2: Calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each mole gives two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so that's 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. Since it's a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reagent is whichever has fewer moles between H+ and OH-.

We have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but there's a problem. The total H+ from the acids is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2, so H+ will have 0.08 moles left. But
