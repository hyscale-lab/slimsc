Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that when particles scatter elastically, their scattering amplitude can be described using partial waves, each characterized by a phase shift. The problem gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67 degrees, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. The rest are ignored, so I guess higher l values beyond 4 don't contribute here.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Wait, I think the scattering amplitude is often denoted by f(θ), and in the case of elastic scattering, it's given by a sum over all the partial waves. Oh right, the formula involves the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The general expression is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ)}.

But wait, the problem specifies along the incident beam direction. That must be θ = 0 degrees. Oh, right, because the beam is along the initial direction, so scattering at 0 degrees would be... wait, no, actually, when the angle is zero, that's the same direction as the incident beam. So for θ=0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is always 1, right? So each term simplifies.

Wait, but the formula for scattering amplitude f has a sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ). And when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1. So the amplitude becomes f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me think about the formula again. So f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(1) ]

Since P_l(1) is 1, this simplifies to f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (
