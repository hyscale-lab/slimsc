Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a transmission electron microscope and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The reason for such a low pressure is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam. But even with that, some gas particles are still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right?

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature hasn't changed, so that shouldn't affect the mean free path directly because temperature is part of the calculation for mean free path (like in the equation λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter, P is pressure, etc.)

Wait, the mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh, right, the equation is λ = 1/(√2 * n * π * d²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules. Or another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where P is pressure. Since the pressure is the same (the ultra-high vacuum is maintained), and temperature is same, why would λ change?

Hmm, but wait. The presence of the electron beam might introduce some changes. Oh! When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules in the compartment might get ionized or excited. Or maybe the beam causes gas molecules to move or change their velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the beam introduces a charge on the gas particles, affecting how they interact.

Wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the likelihood of collisions between gas molecules. If the electron beam somehow makes the gas molecules more likely to collide, or change their effective diameter, that would affect λ. But in this scenario, the pressure hasn't changed, so n (number density) is the same. Unless the effective cross-section for collisions (d²) increases. So if the beam causes the gas molecules to become more spread out, or change their effective diameter, that would change λ.

Wait, no. The cross-section is a function of the molecules' properties. If the electron beam is causing some kind of interaction, maybe the gas molecules are getting charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly. Oh, but wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter for collisions might increase because like charges would repel, leading to more frequent collisions? Or perhaps they might attract each other more, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the mean free path can decrease because the charged particles are more likely to interact. But in this case, the electron beam is providing energy, but perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized. So if they become charged, their effective diameter for collisions would increase, meaning more collisions happen more frequently. Because charged particles might have a larger 'target' for collisions.

Wait, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of the number density and the cross-sectional area (σ) for collisions. So if σ increases, λ decreases. So if the gas molecules are ionized and thus have a larger effective cross-section, the mean free path λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But wait, could the opposite be true? Suppose the gas molecules are getting accelerated by the electron beam, moving faster. But velocity doesn't directly affect the mean free path in the same way as collision probability. The mean free path formula also includes the velocity, but in the ultra-high vacuum scenario, the mean free path is already large because the pressure is low. Wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So if pressure P remains same, and T is same, then λ should remain same. But in this case, λ changes.

Ah, but wait. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is heated locally, increasing the temperature. But the question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the beam affects the gas differently.

Wait, another angle: the gas molecules could be getting excited or ionized by the electron beam, which changes their effective cross-section. For example, ionization increases the size of the effective collision cross-section because the ions have higher charge, leading to stronger interactions. So if the cross-sectional area σ increases, then λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but wait, in the initial scenario, the mean free path was λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps the electron scattering affects the gas molecules. If the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, that doesn't directly affect the gas molecules' collisions with each other, right? Or does it?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile or perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be charged, leading to more frequent collisions between them. So the mean free path would be shorter (smaller λ2), so λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that would be the conclusion.

Wait, but another thought: the electron beam is high-energy. It can cause gas molecules to become ionized. So each gas molecule now has a positive charge (assuming electrons are knocked off). Ionized particles have higher mass and perhaps different collision dynamics. But wait, the main point is that the mean free path is determined by the gas molecules' collisions with each other. If they are ionized, perhaps their effective diameter increases because the ions are larger in size, or their cross-section is bigger due to charge. This would lead to more frequent collisions, thus a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Another thought: if the gas is ionized, the mean free path could decrease because the ions may interact more with each other due to Coulomb forces. So yes, they collide more often, leading to a smaller λ.

So the correct answer should be option C: λ2 < λ1.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a mean free path of gas molecules, denoted as $\lambda_1$. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$, despite the temperature remaining constant. The mean free path is determined by factors such as the number density of gas molecules, their effective cross-sectional area for collisions, and the pressure. 

The electron beam introduces changes to the gas molecules, potentially ionizing them. Ionization increases the effective cross-sectional area for collisions due to the charged nature of the ions, leading to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. This results in a shorter mean free path compared to the initial $\lambda_1$. Since the pressure and temperature remain unchanged, the only plausible explanation for the change in $\lambda$ is the altered collision dynamics caused by the electron beam. Therefore, $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$.

Answer: C
