Okay, so I've got this question about transit detection probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet stuff, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, and their orbits are circular. Interesting.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, so Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but has the same size—maybe a subgiant or something that's started expanding but hasn't yet. So, same radius but different masses. Since mass and radius are similar, perhaps their densities are different. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. Oh wait, the formula for transit probability is: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a * sin i)), wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but both planets have circular orbits, so e=0, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by something else?

Wait, no, I think that's the formula for the transit depth, but maybe the probability is a different factor. Oh wait, another factor is the ratio of the semi-major axis to the distance from Earth, but no, that's not it. Let me think. Another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the probability of a transit is actually the area of the planet's orbit that's in the same plane as our line of sight. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / a)^2 times some function of the star's size. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's recall that the probability that a planet trans
