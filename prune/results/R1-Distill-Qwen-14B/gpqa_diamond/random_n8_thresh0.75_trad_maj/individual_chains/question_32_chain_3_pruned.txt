Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the relativistic formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Let me make sure: Li has atomic number 3, so the neutral atom has 3 electrons. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 =6, so it's Li-6.

The problem asks for the energy of the nucleus. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula I think is E = gamma * m_0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the formula. Let me write that down:

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 ) 
       = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)
       = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)
       = 1 / sqrt(0.0784)
What's sqrt(0.0784)? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So Gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is indeed 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m_0 c². The mass m_0 is the rest mass of the nucleus. For Li-6, the atomic mass (which is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons, but since electrons are negligible for heavy ions, I can approximate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as the atomic mass.

Wait, but the actual mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the atomic mass because the atomic mass includes electrons. But since the nucleus is a heavy ion, I think we can model it as a single particle with mass equal to the atomic mass. Or perhaps for this problem, it's given as the mass. Hmm, but I don't have the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, perhaps I should remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), so the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The mass of a single nucleon is about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV. So m_0 c² is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m_0 c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 *5.628. Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3 *5.628 is 16.884.
0.5714 *5.628: Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.628 = 2.814.
0.0714 *5.628 ≈ 0.0714 *5.6 is about 0.40224, and 0.0714 *0.028 is about 0.002, so total approximately 0.4042.

So 0.5714 *5.628 ≈ 2.814 + 0.4042 ≈ 3.2182.

So total E is approximately 16.884 +3.2182 =20.1022 GeV. Wait, but wait, maybe I should do a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.628.

Calculating 3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute 5.628 * 0.5 =2.814.

5.628 *0.0714 = ?

Well, 5.628 *0.07 =0.394, and 5.628 *0.0014 =0.00788. So total is 0.394 +0.00788=0.40188.

So 5.628 *0.5714 = 2.814 +0.40188 ≈3.21588.

So total E =16.884 +3.21588 ≈20.09988 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let's see. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.10 is close to option C, which is 20.132. But perhaps my approximation of the rest mass is too rough. I think the rest mass of Li-6 isn't exactly 5.628 GeV because when you sum the protons and neutrons, you have to account for binding energy and other factors. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to
