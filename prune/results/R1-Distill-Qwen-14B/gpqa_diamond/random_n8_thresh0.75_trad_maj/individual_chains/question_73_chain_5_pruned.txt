Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, since these are relativistic speeds, I should calculate their relativistic energies and add them up.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. So, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds in the frame where one is stationary, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works. Oh wait, the relative speed formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, no, that's the formula when you have two frames moving relative to each other. Wait, but here both are moving in the same direction relative to the same frame, so the relative speed of each from the other's perspective is calculated using this formula.

Wait, actually, when one observer is in the rest frame of the first astronaut (v1=0.6c), the second astronaut's speed would be calculated. Alternatively, from the second's perspective. But the question is about the relative speed between them, so I think it's the same as the speed of one as observed by the other.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the relative speed as measured in the lab frame, but that doesn't make sense because the question says "relative speed". So I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So, let's compute the relative speed. Let me take the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c. The second (3m) is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut, how fast is the second moving?

Wait, no, the relative speed formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/c²) when considering v2 in the frame of v1. Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as the velocity of the second astronaut as observed from the first's frame. Because when you're in a moving frame, you have to use the velocity transformation.

So the formula for velocity addition is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the astronaut 1's perspective). Wait, so astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, so from their frame, the second astronaut's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating that numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1429c. The negative sign indicates that from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving in the opposite direction, which can't be right because both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the signs wrong. Because u is the velocity of the second astronaut in the lab frame, which is 0.5c. The moving frame (astronaut 1) is moving at v=0.6c. So the formula is correct. Wait, but if both are moving in the positive x-direction, then from astronaut 1's frame, the second is moving slower, so perhaps it's approaching from behind but slower, so in the same direction.

Wait, maybe
