Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have specific absorption peaks, typically a strong one around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's a clue about the functional groups involved.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows six signals. Let's break these down. 

First, two signals are aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents determine the symmetry and splitting of the aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be a pair of doublets. But if they're ortho or meta, it might split differently. Wait, but the question says two signals, so maybe it's a para substitution with two equivalent H's each. Or maybe the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons split into two groups. Hmm.

Then there are two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or perhaps an ester group. Since esters have an R-O-C-O-R structure, the vinyl protons could be part of an ethylene group attached to the ester. For example, maybe there's a CH₂-CH₂ group where the protons are split by neighboring groups. Wait, a doublet and a quartet suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. A doublet might be a proton next to one equivalent neighbor, and a doublet of quartets could mean it's next to two sets of protons, maybe. Or perhaps it's part of an ester's ethyl group?

Wait, no, the ester group is O-C-O, but if the substituent is something like O-CO-O-R, but more likely, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the ring, which itself has a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acyl group, like an ester.

Wait, the presence of an ester group suggests that maybe one of the substituents is an ester. So, for example, the benzene might have two ester groups, or perhaps one ester and another group. Wait, but the ester group itself has a carbonyl and an oxygen, so perhaps the substituent is an ester-linked group, like an aryl ester or an alkyl ester.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe the substituent is an ethenyl group, like CH₂=CH-O-something attached to the ring. But wait, vinyl protons are on a double bond, so perhaps the substituent is an ester group that has an ethenyl group attached. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetate group (like OAc) which is an ester, but that doesn't have vinyl protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH₂CH₂O-C
