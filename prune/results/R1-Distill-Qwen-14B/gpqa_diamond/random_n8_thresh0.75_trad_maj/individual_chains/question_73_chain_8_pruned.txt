Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So for the relative speed, I probably need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the total energy, I think each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so I'll add those two energies together.

Wait, the options are given, so maybe I can compute each part and check the options.

First, the relative speed. The astronauts are moving in the same direction, so their velocities are both positive. Let me denote them as v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. But wait, who's moving relative to whom? Because in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the frame. Oh, right, in this case, the question probably wants the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So I need to compute u, where u is the relative speed of one astronaut from the other's perspective.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is u = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, wait. No, wait — if astronaut A is moving at v1 in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v2 in the lab frame, then from A's perspective, B's speed is u. So u is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))? Or is it the other way around?

Let me think. Suppose in the lab frame, A is moving at v1, and B is moving at v2 (same direction). From A's frame, what's B's velocity? The formula is u = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Because when you change frames, you subtract the velocities, but with the relativity factor.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for transforming velocities from frame S to S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to S) is u' = (u
