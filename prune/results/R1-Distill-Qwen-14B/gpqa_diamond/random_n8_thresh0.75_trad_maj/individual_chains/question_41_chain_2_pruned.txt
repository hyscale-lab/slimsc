Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So the setup is that a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. The index of refraction n is related to the speed of light in that medium, v_medium. The formula is n = c / v_medium, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since c is given as 1 here, v_medium would be 1/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n.

But now the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light beam? I think this is a case where we need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity because the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. Oh wait, but since the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, no, wait a second. The speed of light in a medium isn't necessarily c. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the light's speed as measured in the lab frame?

Wait, but let me think about frames of reference. The problem is about the speed of the light relative to the lab, not the speed of the glass itself. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer and in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n. But when the glass is moving, we need to transform the velocity of the light into the lab frame.

So I think the velocity addition formula from relativity applies here. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)), but wait, in this case, c is 1, so it's (u + v)/(1 + u v). Wait, but wait, what's u here?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the frames. The lab frame is S
