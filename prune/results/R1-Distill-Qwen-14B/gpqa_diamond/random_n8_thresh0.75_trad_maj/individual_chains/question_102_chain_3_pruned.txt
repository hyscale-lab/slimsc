Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment involves using a bicistronic vector with specific promoters and loxP cassettes. The setup is a bit intricate, so I'll take it slow.

First, the construct: it's bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) for two proteins. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3', fused to eGFP. There are stop cassettes between them. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. 

Wait, I remember that bicistronic vectors often use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) to allow translation of the second ORF. So the first gene is expressed under a promoter, and the second is expressed using an IRES, which doesn't require a separate promoter. That way, both genes can be co-expressed from a single transcript.

The vector uses loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. The ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in lox2272. From what I know, loxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected the construct into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. But the mouse model was made homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. 

The problem is that after the offspring are born, they looked under the confocal microscope and didn't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed? Or maybe it's not being properly localized.

Wait, the options: A says ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but maybe if they're both secreted, they can't bind unless both are present. But how does that affect the expression in the construct?

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. eGFP is a reporter; if the receptor isn't properly trafficked, it might not get to the membrane. But why wouldn't it show up at all? Maybe the construct isn't working.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So maybe without a promoter, the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, but IRES does drive expression in some contexts. Maybe without the right regulatory elements, the receptor isn't being expressed.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette isn't excised properly, or if the reading frame is wrong, the receptor might be truncated or not expressed. But considering the vector design, if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then when Cre recombines, the stop should be removed, allowing eGFP to
