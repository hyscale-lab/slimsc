Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the Lagrangian is a key part of the Lagrangian formalism in quantum field theory. The question is about the mass dimension of a coupling constant kappa and whether the theory is renormalizable. 

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, which often appears in theories involving spinors and fields like the electromagnetic field tensor F^{μν}.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember that in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension is related to the engineering dimension. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime to give an action, which is dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4 because the action S = ∫ d^4x L has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. 

So, looking at L_int: it's κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}. So, I'll need to find the mass dimensions of each component.

Let's break it down. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I know that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the action for ψ is ∫ ψ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so the term inside must have dimension 4. ψ is dimension 3/2 each (since (3/2)*2 + 1 = 4? Wait, no. Let me think again. The term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ would have ψ with dimension 3/2, because ∂_μ is dimension 1. So iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension (3/2 +1 )=5/2, and the Lagrangian has to be dimension 4. So ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ is the same as ψ, so each ψ and ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.

Now σ_{μν} is made from [γ_μ, γ_ν], which are dimensionless (gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless objects). So σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, which is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each derivative brings a dimension of 1, and A is a vector potential. What's the dimension of A? The field A is part of the gauge field, and in electromagnetism, the field tensor is in the Lagrangian term like F_{μν} F^{μν}, which has to have dimension
