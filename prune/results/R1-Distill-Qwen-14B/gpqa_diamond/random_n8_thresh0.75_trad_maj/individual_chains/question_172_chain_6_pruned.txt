Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me read it again.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both stars are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means we can apply the Boltzmann distribution here.

Hmm, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula I recall is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Since in this case, E2 is higher than E1, the exponent will be negative, so the ratio depends exponentially on temperature.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, wait. Wait, let me think. So for each star, the number of excited atoms in a higher energy level relative to a lower one is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me define: Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2. The difference is Î”E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. For star_1, the populations are n_upper_1 and n_lower_1. Similarly for star_2, n_upper_2 and n_lower_2.

The ratio for star_1 is n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2. For star_2, I guess the ratio is n_upper_2 / n_lower_2. But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So does that mean (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2)? Or is it that the excitation is twice as much, meaning maybe the excitation potential is higher?

Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio for each star. So for star_1: (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2*(n_upper2)/(n_lower2). Or maybe the excitation is twice, so the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Wait, no, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2
