Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm, okay. Let's see.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that for a valid wave function, the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1. Oh right, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%, so the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

But in this case, the problem states that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but how? Because the wave function's modulus squared is the probability density. So for the wave function to be zero outside x=1 and x=3, the function must be zero there. But looking at the given expression, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but sqrt(1+x) would be real for x >= -1, right? So for x <1, say x=0, sqrt(1+0)=1, so the real part is a, and the imaginary part is -0.
