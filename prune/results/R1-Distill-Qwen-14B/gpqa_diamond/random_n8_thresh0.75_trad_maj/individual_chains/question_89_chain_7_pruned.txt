Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves several reactions and analyzing the NMR of the final product. Let's start breaking it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, and has four bridgehead carbons. The 1,3-dibromo suggests that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead positions. 

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides or dihalides react with it, especially under high heat, elimination reactions usually happen. Dehydrohalogenation, I think. So each Br would leave, and the adjacent hydrogens would be abstracted, forming a double bond. But since it's a dihalide, maybe it forms an alkyne? Wait, no, elimination of two HBr molecules typically gives an alkene. Oh wait, wait—since it's a dibromide on adjacent carbons, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide. So elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, but another possibility: when two adjacent X atoms are present, treating with a strong base like KOH could lead to a double elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, leading to an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or maybe a triple bond? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between those carbons. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are possible in adamantane derivatives because of the structure's rigidity. So the product here is likely 1,3-diene or maybe a conjugated diene? Or perhaps an alkyne? Wait, no, elimination of two HBr would form a triple bond, but in adamantane, would that structure be possible?

Wait, I think in this case, heating with KOH would lead to a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkyne. Because for elimination to form a triple bond, you need two adjacent X atoms. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, resulting in 1,3-diacetylenic adamantane? Or perhaps a single triple bond? Wait, maybe not. Wait, 1,3-d
