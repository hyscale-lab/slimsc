Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying a final product after a reaction. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The compound X has some IR and NMR data. Then it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is from the options given.

First, I should analyze the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of compound X. Then, I'll think about what reaction occurs when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Those are reagents I remember are involved in certain types of reactions, maybe something like a substitution or addition.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 likely indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have very strong absorption around 1700 cm-1. However, sometimes when the compound is deprotonated, it might be lower. Alternatively, an ester or ketone might have a peak around there too. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad, but in NMR, the -OH of a carboxylic acid is usually broad around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 is a broad singlet for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. But wait, another possibility is an aldehyde. But wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm, but they're usually sharp singlets, not broad. So maybe the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid -OH proton?

Wait, but wait, the NMR shows other peaks. Let's go through each:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two protons as a doublet, probably in an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe the other two protons in the aromatic ring. So if the 8.0 is two Hs and the 7.2 is another two, that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, more like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the two Hs would be equivalent, but if it's 2H each at 8.0 and 7.2, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with substituents in two positions.

Wait, but 8.0 and 7.2 as doublets each with 2H – maybe it's a 1,4-disubstitution, with substituents at positions 1 and 4. Let me think. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene, like toluene, but with more substituents. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another is an electron-donating group.

Wait, but the aromatic peaks are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests that the ring has substituents causing the shifts. For example, a substituent that is electron-withdrawing would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded, appearing downfield. So if there's a carbonyl group in the para position, the adjacent protons would be downfield.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet for one proton. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else. Like a CH connected to a carbonyl or another group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet for two protons. Could be a CH2 group next to a CH or another group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three protons. That's likely a CH3 attached to something, maybe a CH group. So like a CH(CH3) group, where the CH has another substituent.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons, probably a CH3 at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from IR at 1720), and another substituent is an ethyl group or a longer chain.

Wait, let me think about the NMR shifts again. If the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid -OH, then the IR peak at 1720 would correspond to the carbonyl of the acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm-1 for the O-H stretching, which is present in the IR data (3400–2500 cm-1). So perhaps it is a carboxylic acid. So compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the aromatic protons: the two doublets suggest two sets of two protons each, which would be typical for a para-substituted benzene. So in the para position, there are two substituents. Maybe one is a methyl group and the other is a carbonyl group? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is an isopropyl group or something else.

Wait, but the substituents would affect the chemical shifts. For example, a para-substituted benzoic acid would have two sets of protons on the ring. If the substituent is a methyl group, the adjacent protons would be upfield. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl group in the para position, the ring protons would be deshielded.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a substituent that is an ester group or another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show any strong peaks for ester groups (like around 1240 cm-1 for C-O
