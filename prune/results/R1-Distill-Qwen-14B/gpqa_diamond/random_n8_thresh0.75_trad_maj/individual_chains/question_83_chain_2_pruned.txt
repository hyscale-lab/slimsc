Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when a certain solution is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem states: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, titrating that with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part.

First, let's think about the initial solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. But since it's being diluted with water, the amount of acetic acid remains the same, but the volume increases. So the initial concentration after dilution must be calculated.

Wait, wait. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M) * (20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles over volume, and when you dilute, you're keeping the moles the same but increasing the volume.

So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which gives OH-) would produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to acetate. So the solution would be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution should be basic. The pH at equivalence will depend on the concentration of the acetate ion.

Wait, but we need to find the pH at 25% titration as well. So let's tackle each part one by one.

Let me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid before titration. The volume is 0.02 L, concentration 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

When we add 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, as I thought earlier.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So, moles of NaOH required for equivalence is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, we've neutralized 25% of the acetic acid.

At 25% titration, half of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and half remains. Wait, no, wait: 25% of the required moles. So 0.0
