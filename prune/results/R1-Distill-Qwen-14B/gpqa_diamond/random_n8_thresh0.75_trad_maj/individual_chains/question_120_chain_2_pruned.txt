Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniformly distributed in what sense? If it's uniform in space, then more distant regions have more volume, so more stars. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think we're looking at how the number of stars in a thin shell at a certain distance relates to the parallax.

Parallax formula: plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. So the relationship between d and plx is inverse. So if I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d, the volume of that shell is 4πd²Δd, where Δd is the thickness of the shell. But we need to relate this to parallax. Since plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 Δd. 

But wait, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the shell's volume is proportional to 1/(plx)^2 multiplied by Δd. But since the density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So the number N is proportional to (1/plx^2) * Δd. 

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So perhaps we need to consider how the number changes as we move in plx space. Let me think differently. Let's say we have
