Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism usually has to do with chirality, right? Chiral centers are where the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. So, let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let's visualize this. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Wait, if the substituents are on the same positions, could there be a possibility of being chiral? Oh, right, biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have stereoisomerism. Wait, but for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. So, if the substituents are on both rings in positions that are symmetric, maybe not. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each ring, the substituents are at the ortho and para positions relative to the connecting bond. Hmm, does that create a chiral center? Alternatively, maybe the central bond is a single bond, allowing for rotation. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric on each ring, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center in the biphenyl system. I think that when substituents are in certain positions on a biphenyl, it can lead to cis and trans isomers, which are enantiomers. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. Wait, that's para to each other on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of substituents on either side of the biphenyl axis makes the molecule chiral. I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should come back to this one.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but methyl ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Then the ester would be methyl. So methyl group attached to the oxygen of the ester. The structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at position 1, the hydroxyl at position 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but is there a chiral center here? The carbon with the hydroxyl: CH2(OH) would be attached to two CH2 groups, the carbonyl, and the methyl ester. Wait, no, that carbon would have what groups? Let's draw it: the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- and two other groups? Wait, wait, the carbon with the OH is
