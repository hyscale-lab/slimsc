Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And the question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the glass's motion affects the light's speed. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way relative velocity works. Oh right, there's this velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. Let me think, the formula is something like (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but I'm not totally sure about the exact form. Oh wait, in this case, c is given as 1, so maybe that simplifies things.

But wait, this is a glass medium, so the speed of light inside it isn't c. The index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed of light in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. Since c is 1 here, v_light is 1/n.

So the light is moving through the glass at 1/n. Now, the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, how does that affect the light's speed?

Wait, but I'm thinking about this in terms of Galilean relativity, but I think that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. Since the problem doesn't specify, I might have to
