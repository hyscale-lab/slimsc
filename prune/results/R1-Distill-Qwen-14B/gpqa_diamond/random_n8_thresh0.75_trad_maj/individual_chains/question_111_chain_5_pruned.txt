Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products A and B.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one plus ethyl acrylate with a strong base like t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking about possible elimination or maybe a conjugate addition. But wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone. When a ketone reacts with an acrylate, perhaps it's a Michael addition? Or maybe a Claisen-like condensation.

Wait, no, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which can act as a nucleophile. The cyclohexanone has a ketone group. Under basic conditions, maybe the enolate is formed. So, the base would deprotonate the alpha position. But where's the alpha position here?

Looking at 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the ketone is at position 1. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl), 2 (another methyl?), wait no. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the positions are: 1 is the ketone, 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and 6 has a methyl. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, a branch at C2 that's ethyl and another methyl, and a methyl at C6.

Wait, numbering might help. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring. 1 is the ketone. 2 is adjacent to 1, and has ethyl and methyl groups attached. 6 is across from 2, so it's a 1,2,6-substituted ring. So, the possible alpha positions to the ketone (C1) are C2 and C6. Wait, but C2 already has substituents (ethyl and methyl), so maybe the alpha protons are less available due to steric hindrance? Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C2 or another position elsewhere.

Wait, but t-BuOK is bulky. So it's more likely to abstract a less hindered alpha proton. Where are the alpha positions here? The ketone is at C1. So the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), making it quite bulky. C6 has a methyl group, so maybe that position is more accessible. Or perhaps the base can't approach C2 because it's too crowded, so it abstracts a proton from another position, like C3?

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone generally has two alpha positions (C2 and C6 in this case). But if those positions are substituted, the base might deprotonate from a more accessible site. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition.

Wait, ethyl acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (since it's CH2=CHCOOEt). So when reacting with a ketone, perhaps it's a Michael reaction. The base would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone to form an enolate, which would then attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, so the enolate from the cyclohexanone would attack the beta position (the CH2 part) in a Michael addition. So the enolate would add to the double bond of the acrylate.

So for the first reaction, the product would be a cyclohexanone with an added side chain from the acrylate.

But let me think about where the addition would happen. The enolate would form at the alpha position relative to the ketone. So the cyclohexanone's enolate would attack the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt; when the enolate attacks, the new bond forms between the alpha-carbon of the enolate and the beta-carbon of the acrylate (the CH2 part). So the addition would create a new substituent on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, but the cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at C1. The enolate would form at C2 or C6. But C2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl, so perhaps the enolate
