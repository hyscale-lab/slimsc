Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, let me read the question again. The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector, and the uncertainty is ΔP_z. The options are various multiples of ħ, so I just need to compute this uncertainty and pick the right one.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So, what's the expectation value of P_z in this state? Hmm. Since the state is |ψ⟩, and P_x|ψ⟩ = (-ħ)|ψ⟩, I'm thinking that because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation values of P_x would just be the eigenvalue. But I'm not sure about P_z.

Wait, but P_z is another operator. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, maybe that simplifies things. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis. So the state vector given is in the P_z eigenbasis. That makes sense because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

So, the state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. Since the basis is eigenstates of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me find out what the eigenvalues of P_z are.

Looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The diagonal matrix tells us the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, where each corresponds to the eigenvalues.

So the state vector |ψ⟩ has components:

⟨1|ψ⟩ = -1/2,

⟨2|ψ⟩ = 1/√2,

⟨3|ψ⟩ = -1/2.

So each of these amplitudes corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z. That would mean that the state is a superposition of the P_z eigenstates.

Wait a second, if the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z, then when we measure P_z, it can collapse to any of them with probabilities given by the square of the amplitudes.

But to find the expectation values, I can use the components of the state vector.

Wait, but the state is given as an eigenstate of P_x, so it's a superposition in the P_z basis. So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take the expectation value as the sum of |a_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.

Because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the weighted average of the eigenvalues.

So, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩.

Each component a_i of the state vector is:

a_1 = -1/2,

a_2 = 1/√2,

a_3 = -1/2.

So the probabilities are |a_i|^2:

|a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 =
