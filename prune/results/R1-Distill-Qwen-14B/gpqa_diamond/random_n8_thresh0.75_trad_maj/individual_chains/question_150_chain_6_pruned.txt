Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find the final product from the options A to D.

First, let me figure out what the original compound is. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like one ring and a double bond, or two rings, or maybe a triple bond and a ring, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. So, the peaks:

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so that fits.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are likely aromatic protons. The doublets with 2H each suggest perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each set of equivalent protons would be a doublet. So like two sets of two H each in a doublet.

Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe two sets of aromatic rings? Or maybe each set is part of the same ring. Let me think. If it's a para-substituted benzene, each pair would be two H as a doublet, but in one ring. So two separate doublets would suggest two different aromatic rings.

Wait, but wait: 6.98 is a d (2H) and 6.51 is another d (2H). Oh, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause this splitting.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H). BS is broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something else, like an -OH group. Maybe these are adjacent to an -OH group, or perhaps in an enol form. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a conjugated system with something else.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet, integrating for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or maybe a NH group, but if it's a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to another CH group. Wait, a doublet for two H suggests that each H is next to one
