Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key points here are about their orbital periods, the masses of their host stars, and the fact that both host stars have the same radius even though one is more evolved.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. So mass isn't a factor here. The main variables are their orbital periods and the host stars' properties.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must edge-on relative to us. The probability is higher when the star is larger (because the planet has a smaller chance of missing the star's disk) and when the planet's orbital distance is such that it can actually cause a transit.

Wait, no. I think the probability of a transit is actually higher when the star's size is smaller relative to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, let me think: the transit probability formula is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. But I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Alternatively, another factor is whether the planet's orbit is in a configuration where it can pass in front of the star from our perspective.

But wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * ( (1 + R_planet / R_star) ), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the latter term is close to 1. So for practical purposes, the probability is roughly R_star / a_planet.

Wait, but in reality, it's more complicated. The transit probability depends on the alignment. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on. The formula I recall is (R_star / a_planet) * ( (1 + R_planet / R_star) ), but again, R_planet is small, so it's roughly (R_star / a_planet).

Wait, but another thought: the formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's
