Okay, so I’ve got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C. We’re given the Mw (molecular weights) for both compounds: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because H3PO4 can lose protons to form H2PO4^- (which is dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, or orthophosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So, in this solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate buffer components.

Wait, but how do they interact? I remember that KH2PO4 is a weak acid, and Na2HPO4 is a weak base. So, they can form a buffer solution. The general idea is that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer. So, in this case, KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-·K+) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-·Na+). So, together, these could act as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-. So, in the solution, the HPO4^2- comes from both the Na2HPO4 and any reactions from the KH2PO4. But wait, does KH2PO4 dissociate further in solution?

Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (using the second Ka value) or accept a proton to become H3PO4 (using the first Ka). Similarly, Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the HPO4^2- in solution comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4. Therefore, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be the sum of these two sources.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration, so perhaps I need to calculate the moles of each and add them, then divide by the volume to get the concentration.

Wait no, I think it's more about the buffer solution. Because when you mix a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. But wait, the question isn't about pH, it's directly about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if the solution is a buffer, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- would depend on the pH, which is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. But the problem gives the masses of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So perhaps I can calculate the moles of each, then find the concentration, and then determine the contribution of each to the HPO4^2-.

Let me write down the steps.

First, calculate moles of each compound.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00733 moles.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 1 / 177.99 ≈ approx 0.00561 moles.

Wait, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- because the
