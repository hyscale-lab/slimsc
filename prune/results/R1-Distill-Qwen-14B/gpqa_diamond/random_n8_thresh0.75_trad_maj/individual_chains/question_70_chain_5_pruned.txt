Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll outline the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let's try to identify the possible compounds involved here.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Solid A and gas B form a bright red product. I remember that sulfur (S) is bright red as a solid, but when it reacts, maybe it forms something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal. Another thought: sodium sulfide reacting with something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction of A with B to form C. Also, C reacts with D to form E. Let me think about the products. When a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product, I'm thinking of something like sulfur. Or maybe a transition metal compound?

Let me think about the third reaction: C + water → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, C when reacted with water gives back A and two acids. If A is a metal, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, but if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide and H2O. But the products are acids, not a base. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is sodium sulfide (Na2S), reacting with water would produce sodium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide. But that would give a base (NaOH) and a weak acid (H2S). But F is strong and G is weak. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another angle: if C is a nitride? For example, sodium nitride, Na3N. Reacting with water would produce sodium hydroxide (strong base) and ammonia (weak base). Still not matching the acids; so that's probably not it.

Wait another idea: Maybe C is a peroxide. If C is sodium peroxide (Na2O2), then reacting with water would produce sodium hydroxide (strong base) and oxygen (but that's a gas, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. But when metal carbonates react with water, they usually just stay as they are if they're already in a solution. That might not produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate? No, not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. And E is extremely hazardous. What are some dangerous compounds? Maybe something like hydrogen cyanide, or other highly toxic gases. Or perhaps a strong acid like H2
