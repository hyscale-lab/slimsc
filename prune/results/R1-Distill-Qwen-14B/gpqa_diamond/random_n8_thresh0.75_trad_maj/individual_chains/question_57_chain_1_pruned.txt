Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember phase shifts are related to scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics. 

Wait, I think I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts δ_l. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (something with e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * some spherical harmonics terms. Oh right, because each angular momentum state contributes. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, along the incident direction, that's θ=0 degrees. So maybe the expression simplifies. Because when θ=0, the cosine of theta is 1, which might make some terms drop out. 

I think the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * (2l + 1) * P_l(cosθ) ) ] summed over l. Oh wait, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial. So for θ=0, cosθ = 1, and P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1) = 1. So each term in the sum becomes (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l +1) * 1. 

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ
