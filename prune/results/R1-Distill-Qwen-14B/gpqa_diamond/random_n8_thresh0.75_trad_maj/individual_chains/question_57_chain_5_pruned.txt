Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, I think. The phase shifts are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1 = 67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13. And we're supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, right, the scattering amplitude in the context of partial waves.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude is given by the sum over all angular momenta l of the partial wave amplitudes. Each partial wave has a phase shift delta_l. So the scattering amplitude f(theta) is the sum of ( (2l+1)/(4π) )^(1/2) * e^{i delta_l} * [ sin(delta_l) ] * something... Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Oh right, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The formula is f(theta) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(delta_l) / (k r) ] * P_l(cos theta), where k is the wave number, r is the range, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, in this problem, maybe they're considering only the s-wave, which is l=0? Because the question mentions along the incident beam direction, which is theta = 0 degrees. Oh, because for theta=0, only the l=0 term contributes, since higher Legendre polynomials at theta=0 may be zero or something.

Wait, no, let me think. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3/4)(something?), wait no, actually, the Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1 for all l, but for the scattering amplitude, when theta is 0, cos(theta) is 1, so each P_l(1) is 1. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because, for example, P_1(1) is 1, P_2(1)= (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 )= (3-1)/2 = 1? Wait, no, wait:

Let me
