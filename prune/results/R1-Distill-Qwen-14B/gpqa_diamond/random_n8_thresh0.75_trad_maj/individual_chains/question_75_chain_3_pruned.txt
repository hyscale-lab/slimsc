Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and mouse models. Let me think through it step by step.

The situation is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is probably for affinity purification. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But they can't overexpress the protein. I need to figure out why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, the plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's the HA tag sequence. Let me think about the reading frame. The HA tag is a single peptide, so its coding sequence would come right after the start codon.

Wait, the question mentions that the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag's coding sequence is part of the ORF. If there's a problem, perhaps the HA tag is causing issues.

Looking at the sequence, HA is a short peptide, maybe something like YPYDVPDYA. Wait, no, the HA tag is usually shorter, maybe just the first part. The exact sequence depends on the construct, but perhaps in the DNA, it's inserted correctly.

Hmm, the question says why they can't overexpress. Let's think about the possible options.

Option A: The HA has a missense mutation. If the HA sequence is mutated, the tag wouldn't be recognized by the antibody, but that wouldn't prevent expression; it would just prevent purification. But the problem here is overexpression isn't happening. So maybe A isn't the issue.

Option B: Ribosome stops early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Let's look for in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence after ATG. Let's scan the sequence.

Looking at the first part after ATG:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So I'm looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding sequence.

Let me go through:

- The sequence starts with ATG. Then, after that, let's see. Let's look for the stop codons. TGA is a stop, so looking for that.

Wait, looking through the plus strand, the sequence goes on. Let's check each codon. For example, the first few codons after ATG are:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTC TGC TGC GTC GGC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CTC ACT GCC GGC GTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCC is Pro. Then ATA is Ile. CGA is Arg. TGT is Cys. TCC is Ser. AGA is Arg. TTA is Leu. CGC is Arg. CAA is Gln. ATG is start again? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the start codon is only at the beginning. So if the plasmid's coding sequence starts with ATG, the rest should continue.

Wait, but in the middle of the sequence, I see TGA. Let's find where.
