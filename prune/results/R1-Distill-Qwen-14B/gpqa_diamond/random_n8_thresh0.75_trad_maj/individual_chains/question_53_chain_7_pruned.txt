Okay, so I have this problem about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O), which would absorb around 1700 cm⁻¹. Also, esters have an O-C-O group, so maybe there's an absorption around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretching. So that's a key point—the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum description: six signals. Let's parse each part.

The aromatic-H signals: two signals. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each with different environments. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, but wait, that would give only one signal. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in the ortho or meta positions. Wait, di-substituted could be either o, m, or p. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak, but the question says two signals. So maybe it's ortho or meta. For example, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Or wait, no—wait, if the substituents are in the ortho position, actually, the ring would have symmetry, leading to two sets: the para positions might be equivalent, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not identical, but that's another consideration. Hmm, I'll have to think about that more.

Next, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically the ones on a double bond. The signals are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests that each vinyl proton is coupling with one other proton. A doublet of quartets is a bit more complex. Maybe one proton is coupling with two sets of protons. Or perhaps it's part of a more complex splitting. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic system or part of a conjugated system.

Wait, vinyl-H usually refers to protons attached directly to a double bond. So perhaps in this compound, there's a vinyl group. The doublet and doublet of quartets could indicate coupling between the vinyl protons and neighboring groups. Let me think about possible structures with ester groups and vinyl groups. Maybe an aromatic ring with an ester substituent and a vinyl substituent. Or perhaps the ester is part of a side chain attached to the ring.

Also, two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups. And no -CH2 signals. So the molecule has two methyl groups. No
