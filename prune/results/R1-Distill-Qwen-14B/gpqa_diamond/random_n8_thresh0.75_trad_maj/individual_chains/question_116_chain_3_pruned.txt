Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet would mean each proton is next to a CH2 group, right? Because each neighboring H would split it into n+1 peaks. So if it's a triplet, maybe each of those H's is adjacent to two H's, like in a (CH2)2 group.

Wait, the 6H in the triplet. Oh, maybe that's two equivalent CH3 groups. Because 6H divided by 3 per group would be two CH3 groups. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each H is next to a CH3 or some other group with 3H. Wait, a quartet would be split by a group with 3 H? Or wait, splitting from a neighboring group with n=3. Because n+1 is 4, so n=3. So the quartet is from a group where each proton is adjacent to 3 others. Like a CH2 next to a CH3.

Wait, but the 4H in the quartet. If it's 4H, maybe it's two CH2 groups each adjacent to a CH3, but that would be 4H split into a quartet, but each of those CH2 groups would be split by the neighboring CH3. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH2. Or maybe it's two ethyl groups connected in some way.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the structure is such that there are two sets of equivalent protons. For example, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something. Because diethyl ether, for instance, has two CH2CH3 groups, but their protons would be equivalent. Wait, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 next to oxygen would have a quartet, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, if the triplet is two CH3 groups (6H) attached to a CH2, and the quartet is two
