Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem starts with (R)-(+)-Limonene in a methanol solution. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. The structure of limonene is a bicyclic compound with a specific configuration. (R)-Limonene has a specific stereochemistry, which I think is the natural form found in citrus peels.

Then, the solution is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh, right, that's a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst used for hydrogenation, typically adding hydrogen across double bonds. Limonene has a double bond, so this reaction will hydrogenate it. But wait, limonene is a bicyclic compound with a specific structure—like a terpene with a double bond in a ring. Hydrogenation would add H2 across that double bond.

After one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is the major product. So, the double bond in limonene would be saturated. I think limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. So hydrogenating the double bond would convert it into a single bond, making it bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The configuration would depend on where the hydrogen adds. Since (R)-limonene is chiral, the product 1 would have some stereochemistry as well.

Next, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation. Epoxidation typically occurs in double bonds, but wait—if product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene (so no double bonds), how does that work? Oh wait, maybe I messed up the first reaction. Let me think again. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond in the ring. So when hydrogenated, that double bond becomes a single bond, resulting in a bicyclo structure with no double bonds. But then product 1 is treated with mCPBA which forms an epoxide. Hmm, but product 1 has no double bonds. Unless I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, maybe I got the first reaction wrong. Oh wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete? No, the question says one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So the double bond is fully hydrogenated. So product
