Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait—i is the imaginary unit, right? So the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. But when you measure the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3.

I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it must be normalizable. That means the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So, the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, maybe the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given expression is only valid where the particle can exist.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd because typically, the wave function is either real or has a time-dependent part. Oh wait, because the square of the absolute value would involve both the real and imaginary parts. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, but wait, that would mean the wave function is a sum of a real and imaginary term. But that's not a standard form because usually the time-dependent part is handled separately, or the wave function is written as a product of spatial and time parts.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as two separate parts. Let me think about the normalization condition. Since the wave function has both real and imaginary components, the square of the absolute value is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because |ψ|² = (Reψ)² + (Imψ)². So, that would be [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, right? Because the particles are found only there. So, the normalization integral is from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =
