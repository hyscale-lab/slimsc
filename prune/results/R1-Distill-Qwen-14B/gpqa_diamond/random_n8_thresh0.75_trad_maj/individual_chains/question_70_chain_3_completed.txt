Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think through each reaction and see what the substances could be. Then, I'll figure out what E is and determine its molecular symmetry group.

The problem starts with solid A reacting with gas B. They use 8 equivalents of B to form product C, which is bright red. Hmm. So, solid A reacting with gas B in an 8:1 ratio. Let me think about possible reactions that fit this. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Wait, or perhaps it's a metal reacting with a gas. Oh wait, another thought: maybe solid A is an oxide and B is a halogen? Or perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or H2. Wait, but 8 equivalents... that seems like a large number. Maybe it's a reaction where B is something like O2, but I'm not sure.

Product C is bright red. Red color in chemistry... perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Like maybe iron(III) oxide? But iron oxide is usually black. Or maybe it's a different compound. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a copper compound. Wait, copper(II) sulfate solution is blue, not red. Oh! Wait, could it be something like Fe3O4? No, that's a mix of FeO, Fe3O4, etc. Wait, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another angle. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe it's a highly reactive compound, like something explosive or toxic. Hmm. Let's think about what D could be. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D and B reacting in 1:1 to make a solvent. Solvents are like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Wait, if B is a gas, perhaps B is HCl? No, wait. If D and B react to form a solvent, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else? Or maybe D is something like Cl2 and B is H2? No, if they react 1:1, maybe it's H2O and H2? Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If B is O2, and D is H2, then reacting in 1:1 ratio would form H2O (as H and O are in 2:1, but if it's 1 mole each, maybe 2H2O?), but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2, but not sure.

Wait, let's go back. The first reaction: solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B gives bright red C. Let's think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio. Maybe A is Fe, B is Cl2? Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But FeCl3 is yellow, not red. Hmm. Or maybe A is copper and B is something else? Copper reacting with... I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could A be a metal oxide and B a diatomic gas like O2? No, that might not make sense. Wait, another idea: perhaps A is phosphorus and B is chlorine. P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. Let me check. P is solid, Cl2 is gas. Maybe P plus Cl2 forms PCl5. But I'm not certain about the ratio. Let me think: the reaction is 4 P + 5 Cl2 → 4 PCl5. So 5 equivalents of Cl2 per P. But the problem says 8 equivalents, so that's more than that. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur. Sulfur reacts with something. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction of a solid metal with a diatomic gas. Let me think of iron and O2. Iron and O2 react to form Fe3O4, but the reaction is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. That's 2 equivalents of O2 per Fe. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents, so perhaps for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. So the ratio is 1:8. Hmm, maybe A is a metal with a +1 or +2 charge.

Wait, another angle. When C reacts with water, it re-forms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is reacted with water, it produces a metal (A) and two acids. That suggests that C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases H+ and other ions. Wait, but two different acids. So maybe C is a salt that, when dissolved in water, produces two different acid solutions.

Wait, but if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, or vice versa. For example, if C is something like MgNH4PO4, but that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For instance, if C is Fe(NO3)3, when it reacts with water, maybe it would hydrolyze into Fe(OH)3 and nitric acid. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, which when reacting with water would release CO2 and the corresponding acid. Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem, when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two different acids. So, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a weak base, but when it dissolves, it hydrolyzes into both a strong and a weak acid. Or maybe it's a salt that, when water is added, produces two different acids. Hmm, maybe C is a metal sulfite? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: if C is a salt like (NH4)2CO3 (ammonium carbonate), which on heating produces NH4HCO3 and NH3 or something. No, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate, which when heated or reacted with water, breaks down into a metal oxide and acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. 8 equivalents of B to 1 of A. So 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. Let's think of A as a metal with a valency that allows this ratio. For example, if A is a metal with a +1 charge, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. Or, if it's a +2, then 4 equivalents of B. Hmm, 8 suggests maybe a +1 valent metal. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are used.

If B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2, then each Cl2 molecule has two atoms. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 8 moles. So, if A is a +1 valent metal, the formula would be ACl. But what solid metal gives a bright red product? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe A is sodium. Sodium is a solid, reacts with something. Sodium and what gas? Maybe O2? Sodium oxide, but sodium oxide is Na2O. So, 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But that's 2 Na per 1 O2. So for 1 mole of Na, 0.5 moles of O2. But the problem states 8 equivalents. So, perhaps the ratio is 1:8. So for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of B. So, if B is O2, then for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of O2. That seems a lot, but perhaps in a different reaction.

Wait, another approach: product C is bright red. Could it be a sulfide? Like CuS? No, CuS is black. Or perhaps it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is black. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be a transition metal with a +3 charge? Like Fe^3+ compounds.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of something like Fe3O4, which is a mix of FeO, Fe3O4, etc. But I'm not sure about the color. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, maybe. So, if A is iron and B is O2, but the ratio would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So for 4 Fe, 3 O2. So for 1 mole of Fe (A), 3/4 moles of O2. But the problem states 8 equivalents, which is 8 times that. Hmm, that's not matching.

Maybe I should think of another reaction. Wait, what if B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 and A is phosphorus. Then P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The reaction is 4P + 5Cl2 → 4 PCl5. For each 4 P, 5 Cl2. So per mole of P, 5/4 Cl2. But the problem uses 8 equivalents. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts with chlorine gas to form NaCl. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for 2 Na, 1 Cl2. So per mole of Na, 0.5 Cl2. But the problem uses 8 equivalents, which is 16 times that. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D and B in 1:1 ratio give a solvent. Common solvents: water, ethanol, ether, etc. If B is O2, and D is something else. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, D could be something else.

Wait, D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent. What solvents are formed from reactions between gases? For example, water is formed from H2 and O2. If B is H2 and D is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2. But the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is another gas. Hmm.

Another thought: what if B is H2 and D is Cl2? Then H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl. HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. Maybe B is NH3 and D is something else? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: D is H2O and B is something like Cl2. But if they react, maybe Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is something else, perhaps H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's 2 H2 to 1 O2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: H is a solvent, perhaps something like ethanol. But how to form ethanol from D and B. Hmm, maybe D is CO2 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is a metal, but that would form a chloride. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the solvent H is H2O, but I don't see how B and D would form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. Unless B is H2 and D is O2, but their ratio would be 2:1, not 1:1.

Another approach: think about E. It's extremely hazardous. So what are some dangerous compounds? Maybe something like phosgene (but that's a gas), or hydrogen cyanide, or perhaps something like sarin gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a highly reactive compound like ozone or something else. Hmm.

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So, C + 2D → E. Since D is a gas, and C is a solid? Or maybe C is a solid or a gas.

Putting it all together, perhaps A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, D is another gas, and so on.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). What's a salt that would produce two different acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe a sulfite or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, if C is MgCO3, when it reacts with water (acidic hydrolysis?), it would form Mg(OH)2 and CO2. But CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), and Mg(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, which upon reaction with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But then F and G would be Ca(OH)2 (which is a base) and H2SO3 (acid). Hmm, but the problem states two acids. Maybe not.

Another thought: maybe C is a bisulfate, like NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into H+ (from HSO4^-) and NaOH. Wait, but that might not produce two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal phosphate? For example, if C is Mg3(PO4)2. Reacting with water... phosphate isn't very soluble, so maybe it doesn't hydrolyze much. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it dissolves and produces Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But NO3^- isn't an acid; it's a conjugate base of a strong acid. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another angle. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps one of them is H2SO4 (strong) and the other H3PO4 (moderately strong but maybe considered weak compared to H2SO4?) Or perhaps HCl and H2S? No, because H2S is a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HNO3 (strong) and H3PO4 (weak). So maybe C is a phosphate and nitrate salt? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a salt that, when water is added, produces two different acids. For example, suppose C is a mixture of two different anions. Like if C is NH4HS. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NH4+ and HS^- ions. Hmmm, but that doesn't directly form two acids. Wait, HS^- can act as a base (forming H2S) or an acid (forming S^2-). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a double salt. For example, something like NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na^+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H3O^+). But then, perhaps the reaction produces a strong acid and another acid. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't much, but if it's a more complex sulfide, maybe it decomposes into H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate and a sulfate, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of each step again.

1. Solid A + 8 eq of gas B → product C (bright red)
2. C + 2 eq of gas D → product E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + acids F (strong) and G (weak)
4. D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio

Let me focus on step 4: D and B react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So, D is a gas, B is a gas. H is a solvent, which is a neutral molecule, maybe something like H2O, ethanol, NH3, etc.

If H is H2O, then D and B must combine to form H2O. So, possible reactions: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's 2 H2 to 1 O2, ratio 2:1. Doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Another possibility: H is NH3. So, D and B could be N2 and H2, with the reaction N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 3:1 ratio. So not 1:1.

Another solvent: maybe D and B are O2 and H2S? No, but H2S isn't a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is NH3. Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl. But NH4Cl is a salt, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol). Then D could be CO and B could be H2. The reaction is CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. Ratio is 1 CO to 2 H2, so 1:2, not 1:1.

Alternatively, D could be CO2 and B could be something else. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: H is H2O, but maybe it's formed from O2 and H2. But again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

Hmm, maybe D is O2 and B is another gas. Let me think about other solvents. Maybe D is H2O and B is another gas, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is PCl5? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is another gas, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, let's think about common reactions where two gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. One possibility is CO and H2 reacting to form methanol, but that's 1 CO and 2 H2. Not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3. Then, D and B could be N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Let's think of solvents that can be formed from two gases in a 1:1 ratio. Maybe H is something like DMF, but that's a liquid and not formed from gases.

Wait, perhaps the solvent is something like DMSO. But again, not sure.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on step 4. Maybe I should move to another part and see if that gives more clues.

Looking at step 3: C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So, C is a salt that when dissolved in water, gives A (a solid?) and two acids. Wait, but A is a solid. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases A, F, and G.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal acid salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, then when it reacts with water, perhaps it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. But I'm not sure how that would produce two acids.

Wait, no. Let me think: if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. It reacts with water to form NaOH and CO2. But NaOH is a strong base, and CO2 is a weak acid. But in the problem, F and G are acids, so maybe this isn't right.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes to form NaOH and H2SO3 (which is an acid). So, F could be H2SO3 (weak acid), and G is NaOH (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate with a different anion. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that contains both SO4^2- and another anion. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate and another anion. For example, if C is NH4NO3, then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NH4+ and NO3^- ions. NH4+ can hydrolyze to produce NH3 and H3O+ (so a weak base), and NO3^- is a conjugate base of a strong acid. So that might form HNO3 (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base, not acid). Doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, Ca3(PO4)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't hydrolyze much. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, and when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't do much. Unless it's an acidic solution, where FeS would react to form Fe^2+ and HS^- ions. But I'm not sure if that produces two acids.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it forms H2SO3 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But again, Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

Wait, another angle: maybe C is a metal chloride, which when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is NaCl, but that's a single acid when dissolved. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NaHSO4. When dissolved, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H+). So, the solution would be acidic, but does it produce two different acids? Maybe not.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me try to think of what E could be. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Wait, if E is a highly hazardous compound, perhaps it's phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. How would phosgene form? Maybe from the reaction of a chlorinated compound with something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is mustard gas or sarin, but those are more complex.

Wait, another dangerous compound is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas, but that's just D perhaps.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. So perhaps D is a gas like Cl2, and C is something that when reacted with Cl2 produces a dangerous compound.

Wait, if E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2, then it's formed from the reaction of CO with Cl2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive oxide or peroxide.

Wait, another possibility: E is ozone (O3), which is a toxic gas. Ozone is formed from O2 via some reaction, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let's see if I can find a pattern in the reactions.

Looking at the first reaction: A (solid) +8 B (gas) → C (bright red). The high equivalent of B suggests a high number of atoms per A. So perhaps A is a metal with a +1 charge and B is Cl2. So for each A, 8 Cl atoms. So, the formula would be ACl8? That's quite a lot of Cl per metal. Maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, wait, 8 equivalents of B. Since B is a diatomic gas, each molecule has two atoms. So 8 moles of B would be 8 * 2 = 16 moles of B atoms. So if A is a solid metal with a +1 charge, then 1 mole A needs 8 moles of B (but each B is diatomic, so 16 B atoms). So the formula would be ACl8? Hmm, but I don't think any common metal forms an octachloride.

Wait, perhaps A is iron. Iron can form FeCl4, but that's tetra, not octa. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that can form a higher chlorination state. But I'm not familiar with such a compound.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that C is a metal oxide. For example, Fe3O4. When Fe3O4 reacts with water, it doesn't really produce much except Fe(OH)3 and some H+ ions. Not sure about two acids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, CuS. When it reacts with water (especially if acidic), it might produce H2S (weak acid) and Cu^2+ ions. But then F and G would be H2S and H2O (no, water is neutral). Not matching.

Alternatively, C could be a metal nitride, like Mg3N2. Reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options given for E's molecular symmetry.

Wait, the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. These are symmetry groups in the point group system.

So, what kind of molecules have these symmetry groups?

- C2: a two-fold rotation axis. Simple structures like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry, not C2).

- D4h: a high symmetry group, including a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors. This is typical of molecules like adamantane or some transition metal complexes, but perhaps more relevant is something like ozone (O3), which is C2v, not D4h. Wait, maybe something like SF4 or another molecule.

Wait, D4h symmetry is found in molecules like octahedral structures with certain ligands.

D∞h is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with an infinite axis of symmetry, like CO2, HCN, etc.

C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry.

Wait, so if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, the answer would be D) C2v.

But what if E is ozone? How would that fit into the reactions?

Let me think: E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So C + 2 D → E.

If E is O3, then D would be O2. Because the reaction could be something like O2 + C → O3. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, but D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If D is O2, then B must be another gas that reacts with O2 in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent.

Hmm, perhaps H is H2O. So, B would be H2 and D would be O2. Then, H2 + O2 → H2O. But that reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: If H is something else, like NH3. Then D and B would be N2 and H2. 3 H2 + N2 → 2 NH3. Ratio is 3:1, not 1:1.

Hmm, maybe H is CH4. Then, D and B could be CO and H2. But again, the ratios aren't matching.

Wait, maybe H is something like CH3OH. Then D could be CO and B could be H2. The reaction is CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. So the ratio is 1:2, not 1:1. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH4. Then, D and B could be C and H2. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of E as a molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry. So, perhaps E is O3. But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is O3, then the reaction would be C + 2 D → O3. So D would be O2? Because C + 2 O2 → O3. That doesn't make sense because O2 is O2, and O3 is formed via some other process, perhaps lightning or UV light.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas. Let's say D is O2, then C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to form O3. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule with C2v symmetry. Another example is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which has C2v symmetry. Let's consider that.

If E is NO2, then the reaction would be C + 2 D → NO2. NO2 is formed from the reaction of NO with O2: 4 NO + 3 O2 → 2 N2O5, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's formed from the reaction of N2O with O2: but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, but SO2 has D∞h symmetry, not C2v.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a molecule like ClF3, which has C2v symmetry. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, similar to NH3, which is also C2v. So, perhaps E is ClF3.

But then, how would that form? Let's see: C reacts with 2 D to form ClF3. So, D could be F2 and C could be ClF. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is F2 and B is Cl2. Then, their reaction would form something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the possible options.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Considering that E is a highly hazardous product, perhaps it's a molecule with a linear structure, like O2 or O3. O3 has C2v symmetry, so that would make the answer C2v (option D).

Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a planar structure with a central carbon. Phosgene has D∞h symmetry because it's linear. So, that would make the symmetry group D∞h (option C).

Wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is linear, so the point group is D∞h because it has a center of inversion and a principal axis of order 2 (but wait, for linear molecules, the principal axis is order ∞, so the point group is D∞h).

So, if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.

So, putting it all together, perhaps E is phosgene, formed from the reaction of C (maybe a chlorinated compound) with D (maybe CO and Cl2?).

But I'm not entirely sure, but based on the symmetry options, if E is a linear molecule like phosgene, then the symmetry group is D∞h, option C.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of compound E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high ratio of B to A suggests B could be a diatomic gas like Cl₂, and A might be a metal or oxide. The bright red color of C hints at a transition metal compound, possibly involving iron or copper.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a highly reactive or toxic compound. The reaction of C with D suggests D could be a halogen or another reactive gas.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to form A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to produce these acids. For example, if C is a nitrate or sulfite, it could release strong and weak acids upon hydrolysis.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents like H₂O, NH₃, or CH₃OH could be candidates. This implies D and B are likely gases that combine to form a neutral molecule.

5. **Symmetry of E**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are C₂, D₄h, D∞h, and C₂v. These correspond to different molecular structures:
   - **C₂**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D₄h**: High symmetry with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules with an infinite axis, such as CO₂ or HCN.
   - **C₂v**: A two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, typical of molecules like ozone (O₃).

Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, it is plausible that E is a linear molecule like phosgene (O=CCl₂), which has D∞h symmetry. Phosgene is a toxic gas with a linear structure, consistent with the reactions described. Alternatively, ozone (O₃) could also fit, but it has C₂v symmetry, which is less likely given the context.

Based on the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule like phosgene.

Answer: C
