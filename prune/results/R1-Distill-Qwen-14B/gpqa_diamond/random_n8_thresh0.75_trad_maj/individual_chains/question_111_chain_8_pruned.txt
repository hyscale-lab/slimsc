Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let's see, the first part is a cyclohexanone derivative reacting with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, and the second part is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Hmm, not too bad, but I need to think carefully. I'll take this step by step.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one plus ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. So, I know that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually suggests an elimination reaction or maybe some kind of conjugate addition, but wait, in this case, the starting material is a ketone. Oh wait, cyclohexanone derivatives undergoing reactions with acrylates—maybe it's a conjugate addition or an aldol reaction?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So when a ketone reacts with such a compound under basic conditions, it's probably a Michael addition. Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone. So, the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone, making an enolate, which would attack the acrylate.

But wait, cyclohexanone's enolate is formed, but with substituents. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are substituted: position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Oh, wait, no—the numbering might be different. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that at carbon 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where carbon 1 is a ketone (so it's cyclohexanone), and carbon 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and carbon 6 has a methyl group. That's a bit crowded, but okay.

So when the base (t-BuOK) is added, it will deprotonate the alpha position. The alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the ketone, which are carbons 2 and 6. But wait, in our starting material, 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. So the alpha carbons are carbons 2 and 6. But wait, carbon 2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl. So the hydrogen on carbon 2 is probably less available due to steric hindrance, so maybe the base will deprotonate the less hindered position. Which would be where?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the less substituted position. Wait, but in the structure, carbon 2 has ethyl and methyl, so it's more substituted, so perhaps the hydrogen there is more hindered. So the base would prefer to abstract a hydrogen from the less substituted position, which is carbon 6. Because carbon 6 has a methyl group. So the enolate would form at carbon 6, leading to which position as the nucleophilic site?

Wait, no. Wait, when the enolate forms, the negative charge is on the alpha carbon. So if the enolate forms at carbon 2, that's a more substituted position. But steric hindrance could prevent that. Alternatively, the base might abstract the hydrogen from the more accessible position. But wait, the substituents on carbon 2 are more bulky, so maybe the hydrogen on carbon 6 is more accessible.

So if the enolate forms at carbon 2 or 6, which is more favorable? Hmm. Maybe the formation of the enolate at the less substituted position is favored because it's less hindered. So perhaps the enolate forms at carbon 6, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at carbon adjacent to the ketone. The ketone is at position 1. So the alpha carbons would be positions 2 and 6. Carbon 2 has ethyl and methyl, which are bulky. So the hydrogen on carbon 6 might be more accessible because it's only a methyl group, but wait, if the ring is chair conformation, maybe the axial positions are more hindered. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an aldol addition but an example of the Claisen condensation. Wait, no, because the acrylate is an ester. Or perhaps it's a Michael addition, but that would require the enolate.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition (
