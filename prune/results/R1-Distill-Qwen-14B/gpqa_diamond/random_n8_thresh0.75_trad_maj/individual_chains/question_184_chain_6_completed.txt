Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That's a mouthful; let's break it down.

So, benzene is our starting material. The target has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering matters. Let me visualize: position 1 is the ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So in the ring, they're adjacent in a certain way.

I remember that when multiple substituents are introduced, the order and conditions matter because directing groups can influence where the next substituent attaches. Benzene is an aromatic compound, so all reactions are typically electrophilic substitutions.

Let me think about the substituents: ethoxy is an activating group (because it's an electron-donating group, being an ether), tert-butyl is an activating group too (alkyl groups are activating), and nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the most powerful directing groups take precedence. So, which substituents are introduced when?

The target has three groups: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. I need to figure out the order of introducing these groups because the order affects where each group ends up.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the directing effects. The nitro group is a strong meta director. If we introduce nitro first, then the next substituents would go meta to it. But if nitro comes later, the existing substituents (like ethoxy or tert-butyl) would influence where it goes.

Alternatively, if we introduce nitro last, then the other groups (which are activating, so ortho/para directors) can direct where the nitro group goes.

Hmm. Let me consider each substituent:

1. tert-Butyl: introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself can undergo Friedel-Crafts, but it's not very reactive. Maybe after some substituent is added.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky because benzene is activated towards electrophilic substitution by alkyl groups. But actually, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts. So the first step could be adding the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but another thing: if I introduce the tert-butyl group first, then the next substituent (let's say ethoxy) would be added in a position directed by the tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is an activating group and is ortho/para directing, the ethoxy could go either ortho or para to it.

Then, the nitro group would be added, which is deactivating and meta directing. But where it goes depends on the existing substituents. 

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, numbering might be such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or some other arrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of directing. Let's say we first add the tert-butyl group. Then, adding an ethoxy group. Then, adding the nitro group.

But wait, after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the nitro has to be directed in a particular way. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added early.

Wait, another thought: nitro groups are meta directors. So if I add nitro first, then the next substituents would go meta to it, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps it doesn't matter. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the order is as follows: first introduce the ethoxy group, then the nitro group, then the tert-butyl group. Or another order.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the nitration. Nitration is a strong deactivating group, and once added, it deactivates the ring, making further substitutions harder unless the ring is activated elsewhere.

So, perhaps the nitro group should be added last, because after adding nitro, the ring becomes deactivated. But wait, if the nitro is added early, then adding an activating group later might be easier.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

We need to get ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups on the benzene ring.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, positions 1,2,3 have substituents.

Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

So the substituents are adjacent, each in their own positions.

Wait, maybe the order is:

1. Introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, introduce the ethoxy group.

3. Then, introduce the nitro group.

But wait, after adding the first two groups, where would the nitro go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before adding the ethoxy, but then the ethoxy would be directed by the nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

First, introduce the tert-butyl group. Then, introduce ethoxy. Then, introduce nitro. But wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring has two activating groups. So when adding nitro, where would it go? Because nitro is a meta director, but in the presence of activating groups, which might direct differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy. Let's think: benzene first gets the tert-butyl group (step 1). Then, nitration (step 2): the nitro would go meta to the tert-butyl. Then, introduce ethoxy: now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups. The ethoxy is an activating group, so where would it go?

Wait, but the ring is already substituted with a nitro group (deactivating, meta) and a tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, which substituent would direct the incoming ethoxy group?

The most powerful director would be the nitro group because deactivating groups are stronger directors than activating ones. So the ethoxy would go meta to the nitro group, which is already in position 3 relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw this out.

Suppose we have benzene.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene. The substituent is at position 1 (for the sake of numbering, let's say it's in position 1).

Step 2: Nitration. The nitro group would be added meta to the tert-butyl group, so in position 4 (since tert-butyl is in 1, meta is 4). Wait, but in benzene, positions are numbered in a way that substituents are as low as possible. So perhaps the nitro would end up in position 3 or 4, depending on the ring's direction.

Alternatively, wait, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So in that case, the nitro is adjacent to the t-butyl.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible reaction steps in the options.

Looking at the options, each is a sequence of reactions. Let's try to parse each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation; adds t-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Wait, that's a typo, perhaps. No, iii is missing. Wait, perhaps option A's steps are: i, ii, iv, etc.

Wait, the options are labeled with i to ix, but in the options, they're written as:

Option A: i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, viii, ix.

Wait, but looking at the options, each has a sequence of steps.

But let me look at each option's steps.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl / AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis?

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → perhaps acid workup or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps ethoxylation via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reducing step, like removing nitro group? Or something else.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Wait, that seems complicated. So the steps would add t-butyl, nitro, sulfonic acid, diazonium salt, etc. Hmm, not sure.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a reduction step, maybe to remove a nitro group? But Fe/HCl is more for dissolving metal reactions, maybe for diazonium salts.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps introducing an ethoxy group via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, seems like introducing multiple nitro groups, which may not be correct.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introducing ethoxy group.

Hmm, again, multiple nitration steps, which may complicate the structure.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy.

So, the order here is: nitrate first, then Friedel-Crafts, then nitrate again.

Wait, but the target molecule has one nitro group, right? So having two nitrations may not be correct.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So three substituents, each introduced once.

So perhaps in the correct option, each substituent is added once.

Looking again, perhaps the correct order should be:

Add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

Wait, but the question starts with benzene. Let me think again.

Perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

2. Introduce ethoxy group via some method, perhaps via nucleophilic substitution if possible, but more likely via a substitution where an activating group directs.

3. Introduce nitro group via nitration, perhaps in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the ethoxy.

Wait, but once a nitro group is present, adding an ethoxy via electrophilic substitution would be difficult because nitro is deactivating. So maybe the ethoxy should be added before the nitro.

So the order would be:

Add t-butyl → add ethoxy → add nitro.

But wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring would have two activating groups: t-butyl and ethoxy. Then, when nitrating, the nitro group would be directed by the more activating group or the one in the right position.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivator, so it must be added last.

So, the strategy is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

Wait, but how would the nitro be added? Because the ring is activated by ethoxy and t-butyl, so the nitro would be added in a position where the directing groups direct it.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is a better director because it's an activating group. But both ethoxy and t-butyl are activating, so the nitro would go into the position that's ortho or para to ethoxy and meta to t-butyl, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in a position that is meta to the t-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substitution order is t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let me think about the positions.

When t-butyl is first, added to benzene. Then, adding ethoxy to t-butyl benzene. Since t-butyl is an ortho/para director, the ethoxy would be added either ortho or para to the t-butyl.

Suppose the ethoxy is added para to t-butyl. Then, when adding nitro, the nitration would be directed by both substituents. The t-butyl is ortho/para, and the ethoxy is also ortho/para. So where would the nitro go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added meta to the t-butyl, which would place it adjacent to the ethoxy if the ethoxy is para.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the target structure. The target has ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the three substituents are adjacent in a row.

Wait, so in that arrangement, each substituent is adjacent to the next. So, the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro).

So, how would that happen? Let's think about the directing.

After adding t-butyl (step 1), the next substituent (ethoxy) would be added in either ortho, meta, or para position relative to the t-butyl. But since ethoxy is an activating group, it would be added in ortho or para.

But to get ethoxy at position 1 and t-butyl at 2, perhaps the ethoxy is added ortho to t-butyl.

Wait, but then when adding the nitro group (which is deactivating), where would it go? It would be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added last.

Wait, perhaps the order of addition is:

1. t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. nitro via nitration.

3. ethoxy via some method.

Wait, but if nitro is added after t-butyl, then the nitro would be in meta position relative to t-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by the nitro and t-butyl.

Wait, but if the first substituent is t-butyl, and then nitro is added meta to it, that would place nitro in position 4 relative to t-butyl in position 1. Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by the nitro. Since nitro is a meta director, the ethoxy would be added meta to it, which might end up in position 6 relative to nitro in 4. But I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

Add t-butyl (step 1) → add ethoxy (step 2) → add nitro (step 3).

After step 1: tert-butyl benzene.

Step 2: introduce ethoxy. Since t-butyl is ortho/para director, ethoxy would be added ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's assume para for simplicity, so ethoxy is in position 4 relative to t-butyl in position 1.

Step 3: nitration. Now, the ring has t-butyl (position 1) and ethoxy (position 4). Nitro is a strong deactivator, so where would it go? It's directed by the existing substituents. The ethoxy is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. The t-butyl is also ortho/para. So the nitro would prefer to go into a position ortho or para to the ethoxy. But the available positions around ethoxy are positions 3 and 5 (ortho) and position 1 (para, which is already taken by t-butyl). So perhaps nitro would go into position 3 or 5. If it goes into position 3, then the substituents are t-butyl (1), ethoxy (4), nitro (3). That would make them adjacent. So perhaps that's the target.

Wait, but the target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So in this scenario, they are at 1, 4, 3, which are not adjacent.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group after the ethoxy. Let me try that.

Order: t-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

So, after adding t-butyl (position 1), ethoxy is added, let's say in position 2 (ortho to t-butyl). Then, nitro is added. But nitro is a meta director. So where would it go?

With t-butyl in 1 and ethoxy in 2, what positions are available?

The ring has positions 1 (t-Bu), 2 (ethoxy), 3,4,5,6.

Nitro is a meta director. So relative to t-butyl, it would direct meta, which is position 4. But relative to ethoxy (position 2), meta is position 5. So which is dominant?

In such a case, the substituent which is a stronger director (i.e., the nitro is a deactivating group, so it's a stronger director than the activating groups) would take precedence. So the nitro would go meta to the ethoxy, which is position 5.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added para to t-butyl. So, t-Bu at 1, ethoxy at 4. Then, nitro would be added meta to t-Bu, which is position 4 is already taken by ethoxy. So nitro would go position 3 or 5.

Wait, if nitro goes into position 3, then substituents are 1 (t-Bu), 4 (ethoxy), 3 (nitro). That's positions 1,3,4, which are not adjacent.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe the correct order is to add nitro first, then t-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, let's try that.

First step: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

But wait, nitrobenzene is meta director and deactivating. So next, adding t-butyl. Since nitro is a meta director, the t-butyl would go meta to nitro, which is position 3 (if nitro is at position 1, t-butyl would be at 4). Then, add ethoxy, which would be directed by nitro and t-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, so it would direct meta. So ethoxy would go into position 5 (meta to nitro in 1), but t-butyl in 4 would direct ortho or para, which would be positions 3 and 5. So, perhaps ethoxy goes to 5, but that's not adjacent to t-butyl.

Alternatively, maybe after adding nitro, adding ethoxy first.

Wait, but no, because nitro is deactivating, so adding ethoxy would be difficult unless we can activate the ring again.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is:

First, add ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, starting with benzene.

1. Add ethoxy: via, perhaps, a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I think that's not common. Alternatively, via a Friedel-Crafts acylation and then reduction, but that might complicate things. Or perhaps using another method. Alternatively, perhaps using ethyl chloride with a strong base, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts ether synthesis is not feasible because ethers are not typically introduced via Friedel-Crafts; usually, they are introduced via electrophilic substitution using an ethyl halide with a Lewis acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that's not straightforward. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring (like with a strong activating group, but benzene isn't activated enough for that without something else).

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after another substituent has been added to activate the ring. For example, adding t-butyl first to activate the ring, making it easier to introduce ethoxy via electrophilic substitution.

So, step 1: t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

Step 2: ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts? No, because ethoxy is an ether, which can't be introduced via Friedel-Crafts. Wait, perhaps via a different method. Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution? Or perhaps via a substitution where an existing group is replaced.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced using a different electrophile. Wait, ethoxy group is an activating group, so perhaps via an electrophilic substitution. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. But in the context of benzene, that's not directly applicable unless we have a leaving group attached.

Wait, perhaps if we have a nitro group, and then reduce it to an amino group, and then do a substitution. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution where a leaving group is present. For example, if we have a benzylic halide, perhaps.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible steps in the options.

Looking at the options, each includes a step with NaOH and EtBr, which is probably a Williamson ether synthesis step. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via SN2 substitution after creating a good leaving group.

Wait, that might make sense. For example, after introducing a nitro group, then reducing it to an amino group, then using a diazonium salt to replace it with a leaving group, and then doing an SN2 with an ethyl group.

But that's a possibility. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, such as using a tosyl group as an intermediate leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce a nitro group via nitration.

3. Reduce the nitro group to an amine (using Fe/HCl or another reducing agent).

4. React the amine with a diazonium salt (like HNO2 in HCl) to form a diazonium chloride.

5. Use a good leaving group, like SO3H, from sulfonation?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too deep.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution when the ring has a leaving group. For example, if a nitro group is present, it's possible to convert it to a nitrophenol (but that requires a substituent in a specific position).

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, directed to a certain position.

3. Convert nitro to amino (using Fe/HCl).

4. Convert amino to a leaving group (like a diazonium salt with NaNO2/HCl).

5. Introduce ethoxy via an SN2 reaction (using NaOH and EtBr).

But wait, the ethoxy group would be introduced in the position where the amino group was. But that's a possibility.

But let's map this onto the options.

Looking for a sequence that includes:

- Friedel-Crafts for t-butyl,

- Nitration,

- Reduction of nitro to amine,

- Diazotization,

- Ethoxy introduction via SN2.

Looking at option D:

i) nitrate → HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline derivative.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group?

But that would lead to two nitro groups, which isn't what we want.

Hmm.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

ii) nitrate → add nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which would not be desired.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps that's a way to introduce ethoxy via a substitution. So, after nitration, reduction, diazotization, and then substitution.

But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration → add nitro.

2. Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl.

3. Diazotization and substitution to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, let's think about this.

Start with benzene.

Step 1: Nitration → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-butyl in meta position to nitro (since nitro is meta director).

So, now we have nitro in position 1 and t-butyl in position 4.

Step 3: Reduce nitro to amine → amine in position 1.

Step 4: Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium chloride.

Step 5: Introduce ethoxy via SN2 with NaOH and EtBr. But wait, ethoxy introduction via SN2 would require a good leaving group. Diazonium salts can be used in this way; for example, the diazonium group can be replaced with a nucleophile.

So, when the diazonium group (in position 1) is treated with a strong base like NaOH and an ethyl bromide, perhaps the ethyl group substitutes the diazonium group.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's how it works. Diazonium salts are usually used for substitution with -OH (like phenol), -CN, etc. But for an ethoxy group, perhaps we need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, we perform a coupling reaction or another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps another method is used. For example, after the amine is formed, we can perform a nucleophilic substitution if we have a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after the amine is in position 1, we can convert it into a tosylate or another leaving group, and then substitute with ethoxide.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring, which we may not have here.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps again.

Target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, the three substituents are adjacent. So, 1,2,3.

So, how to arrange this.

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Add t-butyl group.

But wait, adding ethoxy first: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Then, nitration: nitro would be added meta to ethoxy (since ethoxy is ortho/para director).

So, nitro would be in position 3 (if ethoxy is at 1).

Then, add t-butyl. Where would it go? It would be ortho/para to the existing substituents.

The substituents are ethoxy (1) and nitro (3). So, when adding t-butyl, the directors would be the ethoxy (ortho/para) and nitro (meta).

But the nitro group is deactivating and meta. So, the t-butyl would prefer to go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ethoxy is in 1; para would be position 4, but that's opposite. Ortho would be positions 2 and 6.

But we need t-Bu in position 2.

So, after ethoxy and nitro, adding t-Bu in position 2.

But can the t-Bu group be added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first.

Wait, let's try:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-Bu in meta to nitro, position 4.

3. Now, introduce ethoxy. Where would it go? The ring has nitro (1) and t-Bu (4). The ethoxy would be directed by both.

Nitro is a meta director (so directs to position 4, which is taken), and t-Bu is ortho/para. So, ethoxy would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Ortho is positions 3 and 5; para is position 1 (already occupied by nitro). So, ethoxy would go to position 3 or 5.

If it goes to position 3, then substituents are nitro (1), t-Bu (4), ethoxy (3). But in the target, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So this doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Add ethoxy → but nitro is deactivating, so adding ethoxy would be challenging. Unless using a nucleophilic substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which one makes sense.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline derivative.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → add t-Bu in meta to amine (since amine is ortho/para director? Wait, no. Amines are strong activating, ortho/para directors.

Wait, the ring has an amine group after step ii. So, when adding t-Bu in step iii, it would go ortho or para to the amine.

So, if the amine is at position 1, t-Bu would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step iv: nitrate again → add nitro group. But wait, that would introduce a second nitro group, which the target doesn't have.

Hmm.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro added meta to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Hmm.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. So, introduce a sulfonic acid group. That would deactivate the ring, making further substitutions difficult.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, with t-Bu and sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta director.

So, the nitro would be directed by the strongest director. Since sulfonic acid is deactivating and meta, and t-Bu is activating and ortho/para. So nitro would go meta to sulfonic acid.

Wait, but this seems to be leading to more substituents than needed.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → add nitro.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis to phenol.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → perhaps acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

ix) nitrate again.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me read option D again.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → add t-Bu. Since amine is a strong activating group, t-Bu would be added ortho or para to amine.

Assuming amine is at 1, t-Bu would go to 2 or 4.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Wait, but that would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

So, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The target has only one nitro group, so any option with two nitrations is probably incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has nitro, ethoxy, and t-Bu groups. So, the steps must introduce each once.

Looking at the options, let me see which option introduces each group once.

Option A: steps include nitration (ii), then sulfonate (iii), then nitrate again (iv), etc. So, multiple nitrations.

Option B: nitrates twice (ii and iv).

Option C: nitrates three times (iii, vi, and ix?), not exactly.

Option D: nitrates twice (i and iv).

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Hmm, that seems to have two nitrations, which is probably not desired.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible steps in the correct order.

The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro groups.

The order to add them to achieve the correct positions:

Perhaps:

1. Add ethoxy → via some method.

2. Add nitro → in meta to ethoxy.

3. Add t-Bu → in ortho to nitro (since nitro is meta, but wait, t-Bu is an activating group, so it would prefer to be directed by the activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

Add nitro first → then ethoxy (which is difficult because nitro is deactivating) → but perhaps after nitro is added, another activating group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-Bu in ortho or para to amine (so t-Bu in position 2 if amine is in 1).

4. Diazotize the amine → form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxy group → using NaOH and EtBr, perhaps.

But let's see which option includes this.

Looking at the options, all of them have multiple steps, but perhaps option D includes some of these steps.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → add t-Bu in ortho (position 2) to amine (position 1).

iv) nitrate again → would add nitro in position 3 (meta to t-Bu? Or meta to amine, which is now in position 1, but amine has been reduced in step ii, so it's a phenyl amine, which is activating.

Wait, but after step iii, the ring has amine (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2). Then, step iv is nitration. Nitro would be directed by the amine (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para).

Amine is activating, so nitro would go ortho or para to amine. If amine is in 1, nitro could go to 2 (taken by t-Bu) or 4.

But t-Bu is in 2, so nitro would go to 4.

But the target wants nitro in 3. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps after several steps, the substituents are introduced correctly.

But I'm not confident. This is taking a while, and perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Given the target has nitro, ethoxy, and t-Bu groups, and considering the directing effects, the correct order is likely:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, directed meta to t-Bu.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution, directed ortho to t-Bu.

But I'm not sure which option reflects this.

Looking at the options, option B's steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → so nitro is added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro.

Hmm, that's adding two nitro groups, which can't be correct.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu in ortho or para.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group.

No, can't be.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → amine.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not useful.

Option A:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) SO3.

iv) NaNO2.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps in option A, the steps are:

Add t-Bu, then nitrate, then sulfonate, then diazotize, then hydrolyze, then ethoxy, then reduce, then nitrate again. That seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add t-Bu → nitrate → add ethoxy via substitution.

But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitrate → nitro.

2. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts, in meta to nitro.

3. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

But looking at the options, perhaps option D is the one that starts with nitrate, then Friedel-Crafts, then nitrate again, but that adds two nitro groups.

Wait, maybe the correct option is B, but I'm not sure.

After thinking for a while, I think the correct answer is option D. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: in the target molecule, the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and t-Bu in 2.

So, perhaps the nitro is added first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu.

But adding nitro first (as a deactivating group) makes adding ethoxy difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

But how.

Wait, the target has three substituents, and their positions are 1,2,3. So, they're adjacent. So, the order must be such that each substitution is directed correctly.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu → position 2.

2. Add nitro → position 3 (meta to t-Bu).

3. Add ethoxy → position 1 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to nitro).

But how to achieve that.

After step 1, t-Bu is at 2.

Step 2: nitrate → nitro goes meta to t-Bu, which would be position 5 (if t-Bu is at 2, meta is 5). But that's not adjacent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct option is C.

But I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make a guess.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group, positioned at 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of these groups and the order of their introduction.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Directing Effects**:
   - **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Reactivity**:
   - Benzene is an aromatic compound undergoing electrophilic substitution.
   - Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl) and nitration require specific conditions.
   - Substituents influence the positions of subsequent groups due to their directing effects.

3. **Target Structure**:
   - The substituents are adjacent: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. This adjacency complicates the order of introduction.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, acid workup, ethoxylation, reduction, nitration.
- **Issues**: Multiple nitrations and sulfonations are performed, which do not align with the target structure. The sequence introduces more substituents than required.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration, reduction, nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, ethoxylation, sulfonation, acid workup.
- **Issues**: Two nitrations occur, leading to an additional nitro group. This does not match the target molecule, which has only one nitro group.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, acid workup, ethoxylation.
- **Issues**: Multiple nitrations and sulfonations are performed, introducing more substituents than required. The sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**: Nitration, reduction, Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration, hydrolysis, acid workup, ethoxylation.
- **Issues**: Two nitrations occur, leading to an additional nitro group. This does not match the target molecule, which has only one nitro group.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is the most plausible choice, as it partially aligns with the required steps, even though it introduces an extra nitro group. This conclusion is reached despite the inconsistencies in the sequence.

Answer: D
