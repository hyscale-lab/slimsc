Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of the four. I remember that optical isomerism happens when a compound has chiral centers or when there's some kind of stereoisomerism present that can lead to enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other, making the substance show optical activity because they can rotate plane-polarized light.

First, I'll go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, let me visualize this. A biphenyl structure means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2,2' on each ring (the dicarboxylate groups) and 6,6' are nitro groups. So the molecule is symmetrical? If the substituents are on positions that mirror each other, maybe it's symmetrical. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are the same, does that mean the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Let me think about the structure. The two rings are connected by a single bond, so they can rotate. If the substituents are on opposite positions, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, does the arrangement allow for chirality? Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it can't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. Maybe the biphenyl system itself can have some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, no, because for biphenyls, the substituents can lead to different isomers if the groups are in different positions around the single bond. But in this case, the substituents are in positions that might make the molecule symmetric. Alternatively, maybe the molecule could have some kind of axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. Wait, axial chir
