Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think the mass matters for this particular question because it's about elemental abundances. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, but I don't know if that's relevant here. The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of these two stars.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is given:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = (7.5 -12) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = (7 -12) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, let me make sure I get that right. The equation 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 implies that log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But wait, those are the values for the Sun. So Star_1 and Star_2 have different abundances.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So I'm looking for (nSi in Star_1) / (nSi in Star_2) → I think that's what the ratio would be. Or maybe the other way around, but let me think.

First, let's parse what each of these abundance ratios means.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: This is the logarithm of the ratio of Si to Fe abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe, Star_1) - log10(nSi/nFe, Sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0: [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(nFe/nH, Star_1) - log10(nFe/nH, Sun) = 0 → log10(nFe/nH, Star_1) = log10(nFe/nH, Sun) → nFe/nH, Star_1 = same as Sun. So Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is the logarithm
