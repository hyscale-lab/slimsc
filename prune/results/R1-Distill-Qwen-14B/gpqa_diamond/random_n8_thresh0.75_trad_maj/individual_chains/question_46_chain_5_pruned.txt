Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The compound is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis means breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, so it's about swapping the ends.

First, I need to draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's see, pent-1-ene means it's a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the formula should be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Carbon 1 is the first, so 1 is CH2, 2 is CH, 3 is CH(CH3), and then 4 and 5 are CH2 and CH3? Wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But if it's 3-methyl, that would be on the third carbon.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I should write it differently.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the longest chain is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the substituents on C3 as CH(CH3) and then two CH2 groups. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another way: the structure could also be written as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, no, 3-methyl is on C3, so it's CH(CH3) at position 3.

So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, wait. Let me count. The chain is 5 carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double
