Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, like calcium, forming a complex.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. They also give the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, K is usually the formation constant, so that's the equilibrium constant for the reaction where EDTA binds the metal ion.

So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The equilibrium expression for that would be K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ).

But wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed completely when the solution is made, I think it's under the assumption that the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the K value is so large, like 5e10, which means the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation would be minimal.

Wait, but wait. If K is the formation constant, then the dissociation constant would be 1/K. So, the dissociation reaction would have a Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, in the solution, the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as approximately 0.02 M because the dissociation is so small. So, the change would be x for both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-], because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole of each ion.

So, the expression would be Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x would be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kd ≈ x² / 0.02. Solving for x
