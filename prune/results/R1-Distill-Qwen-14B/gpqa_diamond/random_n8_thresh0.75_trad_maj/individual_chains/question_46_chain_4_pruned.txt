Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A) 4, B) 8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually involving ruthenium, and it's used for ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening, and cross metathesis.

So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, wait, I think I should double-check. For pent-1-ene, it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but wait, the 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So let me see: the structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me number the carbons.

Actually, the correct structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count. The parent chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The substituent is a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is: 

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, another way: 3-methyl-pent-1-ene. So the first double bond is between C1 and C2. Then the substituent is a methyl group on C3.

So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait a second, wait. Wait, pent is five carbons. So the structure is:

CH
