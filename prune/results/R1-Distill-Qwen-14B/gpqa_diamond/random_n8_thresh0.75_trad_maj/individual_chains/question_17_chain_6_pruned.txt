Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given data includes the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formula for the Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. 

Wait, so the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. Right. So the Kf is given as 5x10^10, so that's a pretty large number, which means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. 

Now, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, the complex has a 1:1 ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA. So when the complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the initial concentration of the complex as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. The dissociation would go in reverse, right? But because Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA released would be very small compared to 0.02 M.

So let me set up the equation. The dissociation is: 
CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y⁴-

The formation constant Kf is [Ca²+][Y⁴-] / [CaY²-] = 5x10^10. 

At equilibrium, let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So [Ca²+] = x, [Y⁴-] = x, and [CaY²-
