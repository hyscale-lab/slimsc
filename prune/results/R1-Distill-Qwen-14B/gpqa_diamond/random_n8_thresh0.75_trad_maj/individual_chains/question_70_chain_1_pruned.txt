Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about some chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. Let me break down the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry group.

Let me think about each reaction and possible compounds.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8B → C. Bright red product C. That makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, when I think of red products, perhaps something like sulfur or maybe a nitride or sulfide. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal complex. Alternatively, maybe something like PbO2 is dark red, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the first reaction is the formation of a sulfide. Let's think about sulfur. But sulfur is yellow, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. Let me think about possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a nitride. For instance, if B is nitrogen gas (N2), but then 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of N2 per mole of A. Hmm, but that might form a metal nitride. Let's say A is a metal, maybe aluminum. Aluminum reacts with N2 in presence of heat to form AlN, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, if A is a metal like iron, perhaps it forms Fe3N or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the third reaction, where C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C (maybe a sulfide or nitride) reacts with water, it produces a metal (A), and two acids. Let's think: if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water (H2O) might produce FeO (but FeO is not stable; more likely Fe(OH)3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfide, like CuS, but that's more of a solid. Or perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is a metal nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. Wait, NH3 is a base, but in the reaction, the products are acids F and G. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the third reaction produces acids F and G. So, when C reacts with water, it must produce two acids. So perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For example, if C is FeS, but FeS reacting with water doesn't produce much. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought: if C
