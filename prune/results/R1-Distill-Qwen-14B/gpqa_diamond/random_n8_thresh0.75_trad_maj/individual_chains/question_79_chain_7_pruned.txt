Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that when certain reactions happen, especially those involving epoxides, the NMR can give clues about the structure.

So, the setup is that compound X (C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh wait no, wait. Or is it used in the formation of epoxides? No, wait, no, I think it's used for acid-catalyzed reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from alkenes with peracids. Or wait, maybe it's a specific reagent for epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps it's a base that abstracts protons.

Wait, wait, let me think. Oh, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a bulky amine, and I think it's often used in the ring-opening of epoxides under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acid catalysis. Wait, no, maybe it's a base. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a specific reaction like the Sharpless epoxidation or something else. But perhaps I should set that aside for a moment and look at the NMR data.

The product has these 1H NMR signals: Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So, looking at the protons, there are two singlets each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like being attached to an electronegative atom or being in a symmetric environment.

Then, the rest of the protons are in the aromatic region. The 6.75 (d) suggests maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring? Or perhaps a meta substitution. Wait, the splitting as doublets suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

Wait, looking at the aromatic signals: a doublet at 6.75, then two doublets at 7.08 (2H) and 7.68 (1H). Then another at 7.71 (2H). Hmm. Maybe a coupling pattern from a styrene or similar structure.

Wait, the splitting could indicate a trans
