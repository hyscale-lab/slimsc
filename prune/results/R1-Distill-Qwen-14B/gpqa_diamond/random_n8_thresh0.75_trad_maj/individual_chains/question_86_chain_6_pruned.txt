Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because organic chemistry can be tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about two reactions performed by a chemist. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent and produces a specific ketone. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The task is to figure out which starting materials (A and B) were used for each reaction.

So, the reactions are:

1. A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
2. B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but I think they work differently in certain scenarios. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes. But wait, BH3 is typically used for less hindered carbonyl groups, maybe like in the formation of alcohols from ketones? Or wait, no, BH3 is more about hydroboration-oxidation, which is for alkenes. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait a second, when it comes to reducing esters or amides, do these agents work differently? Oh! Wait, no, reducing esters would typically require stronger agents like LiAlH4, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones or something else.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Or perhaps they are cyclic esters, which when reduced form diols? No, that might not fit the product, which is a tetrahydropyranone.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. That structure has a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and a substituent at position 4 (ethyl). So the ring is partially saturated, with two double bonds? Hmm, no, tetrahydro suggests four hydrogen in the ring, so probably a five-membered ring? Wait no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have a six-membered ring with one double bond. Let me draw it mentally: pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2 and the ring is partially unsaturated. So the structure would have a ring with a double bond between positions 3 and 4, perhaps.

But how does that product form from the starting material A and B? The reactions involve reducing agents. So perhaps the starting materials are some sort of carbonyl compounds that get reduced to form the tetrahydropyranone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are epoxides that are being reduced. No, because the product is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with substituents, and the reduction leads to the ring opening or closing? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, no, est
