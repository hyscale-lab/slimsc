Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and gene expression. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a researcher creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But then they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. 

Looking at the sequence they provided, I need to figure out why the overexpression isn't happening. The options given are A to D. Let me check each possibility.

First, I should look at the sequence they provided. It starts with ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. Then it has the coding for the hemagglutinin tag. Wait, but the issue is that the protein isn't being expressed as expected. So maybe there's a problem in the construct that's preventing proper translation or protein stability.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So if the HA tag's DNA has a mutation, the protein would be wrong. But the problem is overexpression isn't happening. If it's a missense, the protein would be expressed but maybe not functional. But the question says they can't overexpress, so perhaps the protein isn't made at all. So maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA somewhere before the end, the ribosome would stop. Let me check the sequence. Let me look for stop codons in the DNA. The mRNA is synthesized from the plasmid's coding sequence, so the DNA's plus strand is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So looking for TAG (which is a stop codon in DNA), or TGA, or TAA.

Wait, the construct is the coding sequence, so the coding DNA is in the same direction as the ATG start. Let me scan through the sequence for any of these stop codons.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the plus strand (since the mRNA is complementary to the template, which is the opposite strand). So the plus strand's coding sequence should have the same as the mRNA except Ts for Us. So any TAG in the mRNA would be ATG in the DNA plus strand? No, wait. Wait, mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand. Let me think. The coding (sense) strand has the same sequence as mRNA, except Tâ†’U. So the coding strand has ATG as the start codon, and any stop codon would be in the mRNA, which would correspond to the DNA's coding strand having TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the provided sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking from the beginning:

ATG TACC CATAC GATG TTCCAG... etc.

Wait, looking for any of these triplets.

Looking at the middle: ...GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGG
