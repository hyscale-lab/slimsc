Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this is about the dissociation of a complex ion. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²⁻, right? Because EDTA is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.

So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (Y^4- maybe?), but I'm not entirely sure. The reaction would be something like CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²+ + Y²⁻? Or wait, wait. EDTA has multiple binding sites. I think the formula for the complex is CaY²⁻, which dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4- (Y being EDTA in the deprotonated form). But wait, the stoichiometry here is 1:1, so each CaY²⁻ gives one Ca²+ and one Y^4-.

The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5x10^10. Oh wait, the problem says K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10. I think Kf is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, Kf = [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives K as K_Ca-EDTA. Maybe it's the same as Kf. Yeah, I think so.

So, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaY²⁻] as 0.02 M. The dissociation would be:

CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The equilibrium expression is Kf = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²⁻] = 5e10.

But wait, at equilibrium, the concentration of CaY²⁻ is 0.02 M, right? No, no. Wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M,
