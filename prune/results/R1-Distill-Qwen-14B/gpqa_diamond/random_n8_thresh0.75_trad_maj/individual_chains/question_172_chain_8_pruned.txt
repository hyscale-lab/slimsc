Okay, so I've got this physics problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question is talking about iron atoms in two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the problem states that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium. So, I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the population of energy levels in atoms is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I think is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the Boltzmann factor: (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

In this case, I think n_i is the number of excited atoms in star_1, and n_j is the same for star_2. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the ratio of their populations is 2. So, (n1 / n2) = 2. But wait, wait. Let me double-check. If the excitation is higher in star_1, that means more atoms are in the higher energy level. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the population in that level is higher. So, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, I might have it backwards. Let me think. The problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n1 (excited) is 2 * n2.

So, the ratio n1/n2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann distribution, n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, E_i is the energy of level i, and E_j is level j. So, if we're looking at the same energy levels, then the energy difference is
