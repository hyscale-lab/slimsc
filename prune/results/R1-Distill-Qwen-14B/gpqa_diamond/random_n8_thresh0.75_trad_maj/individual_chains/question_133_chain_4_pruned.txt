Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. So it dissociates in steps. The given Ka values are Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. Let me write those down: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. Right, so the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-, the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphoric acid salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is the diprotic form. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, but wait, the formula here is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so that's the same as the anhydrous form but with water of crystallization. Either way, I think the key here is to consider the solution's pH and which species are predominant.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I believe are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or wait, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? No, wait, I think orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Or perhaps I'm mixing terms. Let me think. Oh wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? Or PO4^3-? Hmm, the problem says "orthophosphate ions", which I think refers to PO4^3-.

But wait, the options are in the 1e-7 M range, which is pretty low. Hmm, but let's think about the solution. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.
