Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Alright, so first, I think I'll break this into smaller parts. First, what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid? Then, during titration, what's the process, and how do I calculate pH at 25% and equivalence point?

So, initial solution: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration after dilution would change.

Wait, how? Because concentration is moles/volume. So, moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume. So, moles = M * volume (in liters). So, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

When we add 20 cm³ of water (0.02 L), the volume becomes 0.04 L. So new concentration is moles / new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, that makes sense. Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Titration means adding a strong base to a weak acid, so the reaction will be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present. So, let's think about how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

But first, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. Because when we diluted, the moles didn't change, only the concentration. So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals 0.001 moles.

Molarity (M) = moles / volume (L). So, volume of NaOH needed = moles / Molarity. So, 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So, at 25% titration, we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, for the 25% point, we have added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but wait. Another
