Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the given information.

First, the IR spectrum. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. I remember that carbonyl groups like ketones or carboxylic acids show up around there. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, maybe the compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. That's a really upfield region, but wait, no—actually, 10 ppm is upfield for an aldehyde, but wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, and they are broad because they exchange with water. So that peak could be -COOH.

Next, there's a doublet at 8.0 ppm for 2H. That's probably aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene. Then a doublet at 7.2 ppm for another 2H—so the aromatic ring has two sets of doublets, which suggests substitution at the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene ring.

Then, the 2.9 ppm multiplet integrating for 1H. That might be a CH adjacent to something else, maybe an oxygen or another group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H could be part of a CH2 group, perhaps next to a carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm triplet (d, 3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl group of an ethyl chain, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and some alkyl chain attached. Let me sketch this out.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is the COOH. So the structure might have a benzene ring with a COOH group attached. Then, the other substituents on the ring would be an ethyl group or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group linked to an isobutyl or other branch.

Looking at the options: option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. Another option is A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which is a propanoic acid attached to a benzene ring in the ortho position. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet at around 4 ppm, which would be expected for a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let me think again.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. If the substituent is a propyl group, like CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group that's part of an isobutyl group.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. If that's a CH2 next to a CH, which is then connected to another CH2 and a CH3, that would make a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of a sec-butyl group. That would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the CH adjacent to the benzene would be the 2.9 ppm peak. Then the CH2 next to it would be 1.7 ppm. Then the CH2CH3 would be the 0.9 ppm triplet.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet for 3H. Oh wait, no, it's a doublet (d,3H). Hmm, that's confusing. Because a triplet for a CH2 would come from coupling with two adjacent groups. Wait, but 1.4 is a doublet for 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, like CH(CH2CH2CH3) something, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the substituent. The NMR shows a 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), which could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to something else. So maybe it's a branching point. For example, in an isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the methyl groups would be on the CH, which is the center of the branch.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a terminal CH2CH3, so that would be attached to a CH2. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but then where's the branching?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach is to think about the reaction conditions. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, no—actually, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, I think that when a nitrile reacts with H2O under acidic conditions, it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester, and reacting it with HI could cause some kind of cleavage. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me go back to the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak is definitely a COOH proton. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group. So looking at the options, options A, C have a carboxylic acid.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the substituents are on adjacent positions? Wait, no, para would be positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.

Wait, the NMR for the aromatic protons: doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That suggests that the substituents are in the para position, making the aromatic protons split into two sets of two. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. If one substituent is COOH, then the other substituent is a substituent at the para position.

So for option C, the structure is benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4 (para). That would fit. So the para-substituted benzene would have the COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two substituents in the para positions, each having two equivalent H's. So if the substituents are a COOH and a isobutyl group, the aromatic protons would have two doublets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic signals are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H). That suggests that the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, giving rise to two sets of two protons each. Wait no, that's for meta substitution. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are on 1 and 4, so the ring would have two substituents on opposite ends. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 as one set, and positions 3 and 5 as another. If the substituents are both strong (like COOH and a bulky group), the coupling could lead to two doublets.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets if the substituents are deactivating and meta directors. Hmm. So that fits with the NMR.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent. The substituent would be the alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR for the substituent: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group, and 1.7 (m,2H) is a CH2 group. Then 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group attached to the ring. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let's see: the CH next to the ring would be the 2.9 ppm multiplet. Then the next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH2CH3 would have the 0.9 triplet. But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come in?

Wait, if the substituent is a propyl group, like CH2CH2CH2... but that doesn't fit the 1.4 peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a pentyl group, but I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's a tert-butyl group. But that would have a singlet for the 9H. But we don't see that here. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-propyl group attached in a way that creates branching.

Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So the structure might be something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the substituent as a chain.

If the substituent is a propyl group, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2COOH attached to benzene. But then the NMR wouldn't have the peaks we're seeing.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group, like a propyl group. But then the 1.7 ppm would be the CH2 next to the ring, 2.9 ppm would be a CH attached to something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, think about the substituent as a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a doublet, so it's a methyl group attached to a CH. Like CH(CH3)(something). So maybe that's part of a branching.

So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). The structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So the CH2 next to the ring would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), the CH in the middle would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), and the terminal CH2CH3 would be the 0.9 triplet.

But what about the 1.4 doublet (3H). Wait, that doesn't fit. Oh wait, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group. No, that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a propanoic acid group. But option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would have a propionoic acid attached to a benzene ring. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a benzene in the ortho position.

But in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be split differently. For the ortho substituent, the coupling between the protons would be larger, but I'm not sure if that matches the given data.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the COOH group. But then the aliphatic region might show different peaks.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integration. The aromatic region has 4H, so that's two doublets of 2H each. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent being a group that deactivates the ring.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the structure as a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent, such as an ethyl group. But looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Let me draw its structure: the benzene ring with -COOH at position 1 and -CH2CH(CH2CH3) at position 4. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

So in the NMR, the CH2 next to the ring (the first CH2 in the substituent) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH in the middle (CH attached to CH2 and CH2CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which matches. But what about the 1.4 ppm (d,3H)?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a methyl group attached to the CH. Oh wait, wait a second: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the CH in the middle is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, no. The structure is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, wait, the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3), so the structure is:

Benzoic acid attached to benzene, and at the para position, a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-) would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H). The CH in the middle (CH-) would have neighboring CH2 groups and would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come in? Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, unless the substituent is longer, like perhaps a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But that would have a singlet for 9H in the NMR, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH that's attached to the ring, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the substituent is a cyclopentyl group or something else, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, going back to the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think that reaction is used for the conversion of nitriles to amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that HI can be used in the hydrolysis of esters, but more commonly, it's used in the cleavage of alkenes via hydrohalogenation. Wait, another possibility: the compound might have a nitrile group, and reacting with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into something else.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl peak, which would be from either a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Since the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid, the structure is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, then reacting with HI would do what? Maybe saponify an ester, but if it's a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show a peak around 2200 cm-1 which is typical for nitriles.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl from an ester or a ketone. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, so that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. But then the 10.5 ppm would be something else.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to make sense of the substituent again.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): COOH proton.

- 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H): aromatic protons in para positions with substituents.

- 2.9 (m,1H): probably a CH group attached to another group.

- 1.7 (m,2H): a CH2 group.

- 1.4 (d,3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 (t,3H): a terminal CH2CH3.

So, putting this together, the substituent is a chain attached to the benzene ring. Let's think about a substituent that starts with CH2, then a CH, then another CH2, then a CH3, and perhaps another CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- something? Or perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's consider the substituent as a propyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, no. Let's think of the substituent as a 3-carbon chain. So, if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, that would be a pentanoic acid, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group attached to the ring, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the aliphatic region. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is likely a CH group that's connected to a CH2 and another group. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) is a CH2 connected to the CH and perhaps another CH2.

The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So the structure could be CH(CH3)(CH2CH2...), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2 group attached to a CH(CH3), making the structure CH(CH3)(CH2)2COOH. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group, but that would be a neopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group. But that wouldn't have the 0.9 triplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. Let me think: an isopropyl group would have a CH(CH2CH3)2, but that doesn't quite fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's getting too long.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 attached, but that doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-chloropropane group or something else, but that's not relevant here.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to consider the options again.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

Now, the substituent's NMR:

The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would be at around 2.5-3 ppm. Wait, but in the data, it's 1.7 ppm (m,2H). Hmm, perhaps the CH2 is further away from the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think about the substituent as a butyl group.

The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with -COOH in position 1 and -CH2CH(CH2CH3) in position 4.

The substituent would be:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

In the NMR:

- The CH2 next to the ring (the first CH2) would be around 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

- The CH in the middle (CH-) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), because it's attached to two CH2 groups.

- The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? Oh wait, perhaps there's a methyl group attached to the middle CH. Wait, in the substituent for option C, the middle CH has two CH2 groups attached, but I don't see a methyl group.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. But then the NMR wouldn't match.

Alternatively, maybe I was wrong about the substituent's structure. Let me think about option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para position. But the NMR shows a COOH proton, so that's not option D.

Wait, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would be propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. So the benzene ring would be attached to the middle carbon of the propanoic acid. The substituent would be ethyl in the para position. But then the aromatic protons would be different. Let me think: the substituent is a phenyl group attached to the propanoic acid. The benzene ring would have an ethyl group in the para position relative to the point of attachment. So the NMR would have a triplet for the ethyl group.

But the given NMR doesn't show a triplet, but a 0.9 triplet which is probably the end of a longer chain.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction part again. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's a typical condition for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the compound is already a carboxylic acid, then this reaction wouldn't make sense. Unless the substituent is a nitrile group, which would be converted to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl from a nitrile (but nitriles are usually higher, around 2200 cm-1). Alternatively, if the substituent is a ketone, the peak would be around 1700 cm-1 or so.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone group. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might do something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, which upon reaction with HI would undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But the initial structure would have an ester group, and the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But the given NMR shows a COOH proton, so perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the options have some as benzoic acids. So perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the starting material is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into a carboxylic acid.

So the starting compound would be a benzene ring with a nitrile group and some substituent. Then, after hydrolysis, it becomes a benzene ring with a COOH group and the same substituent.

Hmm, but the NMR given already shows a COOH proton. So perhaps the initial structure doesn't have the COOH group. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But then the initial NMR wouldn't have the COOH peak.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to make a decision.

The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent, which appears to be a sec-butyl group. So option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? I'm not entirely sure about the reaction conditions, but if it's a benzoic acid derivative, I'm not sure if it would react. Alternatively, if the substituent is a nitrile, then HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR already shows a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe the substituent is an alkyl group, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Based on the given data, I think the correct structure is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The compound in question is analyzed based on its IR and NMR data, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is considered to identify the final product.

### IR Analysis:
- The IR spectrum shows a strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group. 
- Peaks in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- The aromatic region shows two doublets at **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**, indicating a **para-substituted benzene ring** with two substituents.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** peak corresponds to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl group.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** peak suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH group.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** peak indicates a methyl group attached to a CH.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** peak corresponds to a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR data suggests a **para-substituted benzene ring** with a **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) and a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂CH(CH₂CH₃)) as substituents. This matches the structure of **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions involving red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since the compound already contains a carboxylic acid group, no further reaction is expected under these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter its structure.

**Answer: C**
