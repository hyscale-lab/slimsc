Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

First, I'll go through the given information. The compound has an ester group, which I know because the IR shows the characteristic ester peaks. Ester groups usually have a strong absorption around 1740 cm-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that's one functional group accounted for.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals in total.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, which could mean that the substituents are in positions that cause different environments for the aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution could be para, meta, or ortho. But for a di-substituted benzene, the splitting of aromatic protons into two signals could be possible in certain substitution patterns. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in para substitution, you'd have two equivalent protons, so maybe that's why it's two signals. Or maybe it's not para. Let me think. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), the aromatic protons might split into more signals. Hmm, maybe it's para substitution because that gives two sets of equivalent protons. Or perhaps it's a meta substitution with substituents in a way that two different sets of aromatic protons are present.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in regions around 4-7 ppm. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets implies coupling with two different sets of protons—maybe each proton is coupling with two different neighbors. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure has a double bond with substituents on either side. Like perhaps a vinyl group attached to another group.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups in the structure. And importantly, there are no –CH2 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups but no methylene (CH2) groups.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an ester group attached to the benzene ring, and another substituent which might be a vinyl group or perhaps a group containing methyl groups.

Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents could be an ester group and another group. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the substituents are an ester (like OAc or something else) and a vinyl group, or perhaps another substituent that includes methyl groups.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O something? No, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if the benzene has an ester group, perhaps it's attached as a substituent. Let's say it's an aryl ester, like O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene.

Wait, but wait, the other substituent could be a vinyl group or a group that introduces methyl groups. Let me think about the NMR signals again. The –CH
