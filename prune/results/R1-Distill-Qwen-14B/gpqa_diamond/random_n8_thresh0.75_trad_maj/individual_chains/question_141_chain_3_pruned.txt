Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think I've heard of that before. Oh right, that's benzene with a bromine on the first carbon and a deuterium on the second. Or wait, maybe the structure is benzene with bromine and a deutero group in specific positions. Let me think. So the molecule is C6H5BrD, with the Br on position 1 and D on position 2. So the structure is such that the bromine is adjacent to the deuterium.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for elimination reactions, especially in the dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides to form alkenes. But wait, this is a benzene ring. So perhaps it's about aromatic substitution? Or elimination?

Wait, benzene rings with adjacent substituents... Hmm. Wait, wait, another thought: when you have a benzyl halide, like bromobenzene, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination. But wait, in the case of bromobenzene, that's a single substituent on the ring. But wait, in this case, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the bromine is on position 1, and the deuterium is on position 2. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's a benzene ring where position 1 is bromo and position 2 is a deuterium (like a hydrogen replaced by D). So the two substituents are adjacent.

Wait, but in reality, benzene is symmetric, so having substituents on adjacent positions (like 1 and 2) would lead to certain possible
