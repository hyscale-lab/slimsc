Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says I'm mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but since this is a specific mixture, I guess I have to calculate the moles involved.

First, I should figure out how much acid and base each solution contributes. Let's break it down.

Starting with HCl. It's a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+ ions. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Which means 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So the volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So the volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M, so moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So which one is the limiting reagent here?

H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, what about the excess H+? Does that affect the reaction? Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ reacted.

So the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, since OH- is the limiting. So the enthalpy change would be based on 0.2 moles.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of reaction. For strong acids and bases, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since the reaction is exothermic.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should think about the heat capacity approach. Because sometimes the enthalpy is calculated using the heat released and the solution's temperature change, but in this question, it's not given. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate using the moles of acid and base.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the standard enthalpy. Because the problem is mixing three solutions, maybe the enthalpy is calculated based on the total moles of H+ and OH- consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider how much acid and base are present and see if they completely neutralize each other.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 equivalents (since each HCl gives one H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 equivalents.

So total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq. Base equivalents: 0.2 eq.

So the acid is in excess. The neutralization will consume 0.2 eq of H+ and 0.2 eq of OH-, producing 0.2 mol of H2O. The excess 0.08 eq of H+ will remain.

But the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So 0.2 mol reacting, each releasing about 57 kJ (but wait, standard is 57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acids and bases). Since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative.

So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Which is about -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, units matter here.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the units. The options are in kcal and kJ. So if the calculation is in kJ, then -11.4 kJ would be the answer. But none of the options exactly match that. Let me look again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, option B is about -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4kcal would be around 47.8 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate using the heat released, but then again, without knowing the specific heat or temperature change, that might not be possible. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the total moles of acid and base and see how much neutralization occurs, then calculate the enthalpy based on that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the solution, it might not fully dissociate? No, wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in solution, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, considering all possible reactions, including any precipitation? Because Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 could form BaSO4, which is a precipitate.

Oh! I think I forgot about that. So when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they can form BaSO4 precipitate. So the reaction would involve that as well.

Let me think: The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4, H2O, and perhaps some excess H+ or OH-.

The balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let me write the full ionic equation.

H2SO4 (aq) → 2 H+ (aq) + SO4^2- (aq)

Ba(OH)2 (aq) → Ba^2+ (aq) + 2 OH- (aq)

When they react, the H+ and OH- combine to form water, and Ba^2+ and SO4^2- form BaSO4 precipitate.

So the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps that affects the stoichiometry.

Wait, but in terms of moles, how much Ba(OH)2 do we have?

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles.

So the mole ratio is 0.09 H2SO4 to 0.1 Ba(OH)2. The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1 for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here because 0.09 < 0.1. So all H2SO4 will react, and some Ba(OH)2 will remain.

Wait, no, wait. Let's calculate how much Ba(OH)2 is needed to react with 0.09 moles of H2SO4.

H2SO4 : Ba(OH)2 = 1:1.

So 0.09 moles H2SO4 requires 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

We have 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, so after reaction, 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2 left.

So the reaction consumes 0.09 moles of H2SO4 and 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

So the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react in a 1:1 ratio, producing water.

So 0.18 moles H+ + 0.18 moles OH- → 0.18 moles H2O.

Wait, but wait, that's just the neutralization part of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. The other part is the formation of BaSO4 precipitate.

So the total enthalpy change would be the sum of the neutralization and the precipitation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4, and two moles of H2O.

The reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Now, the enthalpy change for this reaction is the sum of the neutralization and precipitation.

But wait, the neutralization part (H+ + OH- → H2O) is exothermic, and the precipitation (formation of BaSO4) also releases energy because it's a solid forming from ions.

But I'm not exactly sure about the enthalpy values for these processes. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the neutralization part, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture and find how much neutralization occurs, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

But considering the precipitation complicates things because it affects the availability of H+ and OH-.

Let me try another approach.

Calculate the total H+ and OH- from all solutions, then determine the net reaction.

So:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

They'll neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- remaining: 0 → because OH- is the limiting reactant.

Wait, but wait, I thought about the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 earlier. Did that affect the H+ and OH- available?

Ah, because when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, they form BaSO4 precipitate and water, which consumes some of the H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me think again. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it donates 2 H+ per molecule. Ba(OH)2 donates 2 OH- per molecule.

When they react, each H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 H2O (since each H2SO4 has 2 H+ and Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH-). So 0.09 moles H2SO4 will produce 0.18 moles H+, and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 will produce 0.18 moles OH-. These will neutralize each other, producing 0.18 moles H2O.

But what about the rest of the OH- from Ba(OH)2?

Wait, let's break it down.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

But, when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they form a precipitate, which uses some of the H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 combine first, leaving the H+ from HCl to react with any remaining OH-.

So let me approach it step by step.

1. H2SO4 (0.09 moles) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1 moles) react.

They produce BaSO4 precipitate and water. The reaction consumes 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 → 2 OH- → 0.2 moles OH-.

But in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with a mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 H2O and 1 BaSO4.

So the moles involved:

H2SO4: 0.09 moles → produces 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles → produces 0.18 moles OH-.

These H+ and OH- will neutralize each other: 0.18 H+ + 0.18 OH- → 0.18 H2O.

So after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles → which contributes 0.02 moles OH-.

Wait, no. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so even if it's in excess, it will dissociate completely. So the initial OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

But when 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4, does that change the amount of OH- available?

Hmm, perhaps when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, they consume both H+ and OH-.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 react to form water, but also Ba^2+ and SO4^2- combine to form BaSO4 precipitate.

So in that case, the 0.09 moles of H2SO4 provide 0.18 moles H+, and the 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 provide 0.18 moles OH-. These neutralize, producing 0.18 moles H2O. Also, 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 react with 0.09 moles H2SO4 to form 0.09 moles BaSO4.

After this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 moles, contributing 0.02 moles OH-.

So now, the remaining H+ comes only from HCl: 0.1 moles.

And the remaining OH- is 0.02 moles from the excess Ba(OH)2.

So the H+ and OH- will now react: 0.1 H+ + 0.02 OH- → 0.02 H2O.

So total moles of H+ that reacted: 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.20 moles.

Wait, but wait, the H+ from HCl can also react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. So in the initial mixture, after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, we have:

H+ left: 0.1 (from HCl).

OH- left: 0.02 (from excess Ba(OH)2).

So these will react: 0.02 moles of H+ and OH- neutralize, producing 0.02 moles H2O.

So the total H+ that reacts is 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 moles.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the total H+ and total OH- in the entire mixture and see how much neutralization occurs.

Total H+:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, when mixed, H+ and OH- will react.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

But wait, but when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they form a precipitate, which consumes some of the acid and base, so their H+ and OH- are used in the formation of BaSO4 and water, not just neutralization.

So perhaps the initial approach of total H+ and OH- isn't correct because some of them are tied up in the precipitation reaction.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- after considering the precipitation.

So, when H2SO4 (0.09 mol) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) are mixed:

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

This reaction uses up 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So, the moles involved in this reaction:

H2SO4 → 0.09 mol → 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 mol → 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol OH-.

These H+ and OH- react to form 0.18 mol H2O.

So, after this reaction, what's left?

H2SO4: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol left.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol left → 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ remains.

So now, the remaining H+ is from HCl: 0.1 mol.

The remaining OH- is from excess Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

These will react: 0.02 mol H+ + 0.02 mol OH- → 0.02 mol H2O.

So total H+ that reacted: 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 mol.

Wait, but the initial total H+ was 0.28, and OH- 0.2. So H+ after reaction: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08. But according to this, the H+ reacted is 0.20, which is higher than initial OH- available. Hmm, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of neutralization and precipitation separately.

First, calculate the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, then the neutralization of any remaining H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the Ba(OH)2 will react with both H2SO4 and HCl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to sum the moles of H+ from all acids and OH- from all bases, and find the neutralization.

In that case, moles of H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching. But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ; 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.725). So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's think about the stoichiometry again.

Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So in the neutralization, each mole of H+ requires one mole of OH-.

Hmm, so when considering the neutralization, the limiting reagent is OH-: 0.2 moles.

So 0.2 moles of H+ from the acids will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

But the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but what's the exact way to calculate this?

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. So if 0.2 moles are neutralized, then 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. Option D is -16 kJ, which is close but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all of the OH- is neutralized, including what's from Ba(OH)2 and what's from H2SO4.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to compute the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+:

HCl: 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Total OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

So, when mixed, 0.2 mol OH- reacts with 0.2 mol H+.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options exactly match this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same number but in kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different enthalpy value. For example, maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, if that's the case, then 0.2 moles * (-3.80 kcal/mol) = -0.76 kcal. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released based on the total volume and specific heat, but without data on temperature change, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute the moles of each substance:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Molar ratio is 1:1.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol. So H2SO4 is limiting.

So, 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

This reaction produces 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

But the enthalpy change for this reaction would include both the neutralization and the precipitation.

Wait, but I don't know the enthalpy change for the formation of BaSO4. So perhaps this approach isn't feasible without additional data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the precipitation doesn't affect the neutralization, and we can proceed as if all the OH- from Ba(OH)2 neutralizes H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

In that case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles neutralize, releasing 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Oh wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes 2 equivalents of H+.

So, for H2SO4: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 eq.

HCl: 0.1 mol *1 = 0.1 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol *2 = 0.2 eq.

So neutralization: 0.2 eq OH- neutralizes 0.2 eq H+.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's compute what that is in kJ.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal is 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. But that's positive, but the option is negative. So that would be about -47.8 kJ, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the standard enthalpy of neutralization as -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-3.80) = -0.76 kcal. Not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include the heat released from the precipitation of BaSO4.

The enthalpy of formation of BaSO4 is known, but without specific data, this is hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering the neutralization between the OH- and H+ from all acids, without considering the precipitation.

In that case, the neutralization is 0.2 moles → -11.4 kJ. But no option matches.

Wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. Which is approximately 11.4 kJ, but in kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the units are mixed.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is to be done in kcal.

Wait, 1 mole of H+ neutralized releases about 3.80 kcal (since 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (57/4.184 ≈ 13.6)). Wait, no, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, wait, 1 calorie is 4.184 joules. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

So per mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change is -13.6 kcal/mol.

In our case, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal.

Ah, that would match option A (-2.72 kcal). But why? Because I thought 57 kJ is per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait, 57 kJ is per mole of H+ (or OH-), yes.

So 57 kJ = 57,000 J.

Convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6 kcal.

So per mole, it's -13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal.

Which is option A.

But earlier, I thought the total moles of H+ reacting was 0.2.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, when you mix all the solutions, the OH- is 0.2 moles, so 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

So 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be option A.

But earlier I thought it would be -11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal. No, wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 11,400 /4,184 ≈ 2.725 kcal.

Wait, so 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Which is equal to -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ.

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches with the 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ) converted to kcal.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the OH- is 0.2 moles, so the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ → enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is equal to -2.72 kcal.

Hence, the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base, diprotic):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Total moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:
- Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Neutralization Reaction:
H⁺ and OH⁻ react in a 1:1 ratio to form water:  
\[
\text{H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O}.
\]  
The limiting reagent is OH⁻, as there are only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ available to react with \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ will neutralize, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of unreacted H⁺.

### Enthalpy of Neutralization:
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to kcal:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
