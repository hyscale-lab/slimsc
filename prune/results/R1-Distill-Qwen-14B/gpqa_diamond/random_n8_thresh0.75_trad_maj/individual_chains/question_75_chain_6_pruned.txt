Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a researcher trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They introduced a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. But when they tried to express it, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found something wrong.

So, the options are A to D, each suggesting a different reason why the protein isn't being expressed. Let's break down what's going on.

First, the setup: The researcher made a construct where the coding sequence for GADD45G is modified to include the HA tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect it into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They're selecting for antibiotic resistance to test expression. But no overexpression is happening. So something's wrong with the construct.

Looking at the given sequence: The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The HA tag would presumably be right after that. The HA tag is a short peptide from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. It's commonly used as an epitope tag. So, the construct should have the HA sequence followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but looking at the beginning of the sequence: The first part after ATG is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then comes CCAT, which is proline, then CGA, which is arginine, etc. Hmm. But the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence encoding this would be TAC GCC ATG GAT GTA CTC TAT CCA. Let me think—so the HA tag starts with TAC (tyr), then GCC (ala), ATG (met), GAT (as), etc.

Wait, in the given sequence, the start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the ATG is the start codon, then TAC is Tyr, then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), G... So that would be the start of the HA tag? Let me double-check. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the first few amino acids are Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, etc. The DNA sequence for Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT. So the first part of the HA tag in DNA would be TAC CCA TAC GAT... which seems to match the beginning of the given sequence.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So, after ATG (start), the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. That would correctly encode the HA tag. So that's the beginning—so why isn't the protein being expressed?

Looking at the options, option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So, if the HA tag's DNA is mutated, leading to a wrong amino acid. But looking at the given sequence, the start after ATG is TAC, which is correct for Y. So unless there's something wrong further along. Alternatively, maybe the construct lacks a termination codon, but no, the original coding sequence is for GADD45G, which should have its own stop codon.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the reading frame is off. Let me check the reading frame. The HA tag is usually in frame with the protein of interest. So after the ATG, the sequence should be in frame. Let's see: ATG is +1, then TAC is +2, CCA +3, TAC +4, etc. That's correct for a reading frame.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. How? Maybe a stop codon is introduced somewhere. Let's look for a
