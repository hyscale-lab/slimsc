Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. We need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power of 1 over plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, actually, the parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Now, the scenario is that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in the sky... but wait, do they mean uniformly distributed in space or on the celestial sphere? Oh, probably in space. Because in the sky (celestial sphere), distribution might be different, but the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky," which I think refers to the celestial sphere. But wait, maybe not. Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax, which relates to their distances.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. Since parallax is related to distance, and volume depends on distance cubed. Let me think.

Parallax (in arcseconds) is given by plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So more distant regions have more volume per shell, hence more stars. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for a small change in parallax, how does the number of stars in that range depend on plx.

Let me think about the distribution
