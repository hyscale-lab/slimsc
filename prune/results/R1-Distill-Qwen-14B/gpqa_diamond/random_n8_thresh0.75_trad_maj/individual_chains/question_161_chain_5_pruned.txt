Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vacuum physics, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the setup: Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV accelerating voltage. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But despite that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spec. So, the mean free path of these gas molecules was calculated as λ1. 

Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Or wait, maybe it's another formula. Oh right, another way to express mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, T is temperature, and P is pressure. Or wait, I think another common formula is λ = (1.38e-23 m^2·K·mol^-1 * T) / (2 * π * d^2 * P). Hmm, but maybe I should think in terms of how pressure affects λ.

So, when the electron beam is off, the mean free path is λ1. But when the beam is on, Mike observes λ2. The question is, why would λ2 be different from λ1?

Wait, the temperature remains the same, so T is constant. The pressure inside the chamber is also the same, because the pumps are running and the vacuum state is maintained. So why would the mean free path change?

Oh wait, maybe it's because the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. When the beam is on, electrons are moving through the gas. Do the electrons cause any changes in the gas? Like, maybe the gas molecules are ionized by the electron beam. Or maybe the energy from the electrons heats the gas, increasing the temperature. But the question states that the temperature remained the same, so that can't be it.

Alternatively, when the electrons scatter off the gas molecules, does that change the gas's behavior? Well, the electrons are high-energy because the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV. That's pretty high. So, the electrons could cause the gas molecules to ionize or even dissoci
