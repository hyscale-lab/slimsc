Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, you get a buffer solution until the equivalence point. At equivalence, I think the solution becomes a salt of the weak acid, which will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

So first, I need to figure out what the concentrations are after dilution and then during titration.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be (0.05 M) * (0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? The equivalence point. So I need to find how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point.

Let me calculate the equivalence point volume. Moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and since NaOH is a strong base, it'll react 1:1 with the acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³.

So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's compute how many moles that is: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles of NaOH. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) will increase by the same amount.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. So after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate will be 0.00025 moles. The total solution volume now is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka, which is 1.85x10^-5. So pKa is around 4.74? Let me compute that. log(1.85e-5) is about 4.7355, so pKa ≈ 4.74.

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263.

Wait, that's about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, but I remember that the equivalence point pH is higher. Let's see what happens at the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it'll hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

The moles of acetate are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH at equivalence (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion (CH3COO^-) reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3CO
