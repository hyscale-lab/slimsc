Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A, B, C, D with different formulas. I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the index of refraction comes into play. The speed of light in a medium is usually c divided by n. So in the glass, the speed should be v_glass = c/n, which is 1/n since c is 1 here.

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So the observer is moving relative to the glass, or the glass is moving relative to the observer. Since the glass is moving toward the observer, but in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. Interesting.

I think this is a problem involving relative velocity. When objects are moving, how do velocities add? I remember the Galilean transformation for velocities and the Lorentz transformations, but I'm not sure which applies here. Oh wait, this is about light in a medium, maybe the Galilean approach would be more applicable because the speed of light here isn't close to c in the lab frame. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed as observed in the lab?

Let me try to visualize. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. So the speed of the light relative to the lab would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass, right?

Wait, no. Because the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at velocity u in the glass. So relative to the lab, the light's speed is u + v. But wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is 1/n. So in the lab frame, it's (1/n) + v?

Wait, that can't be right because if v is significant compared to 1/c (which here is 1), then adding them directly would be incorrect. Oh wait, but the problem is in a non-relativistic context
