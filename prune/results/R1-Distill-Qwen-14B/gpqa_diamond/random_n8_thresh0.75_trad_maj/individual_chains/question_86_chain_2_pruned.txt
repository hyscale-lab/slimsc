Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents, and I need to choose the correct starting materials for both reactions.

Alright, let me read the question again carefully. So, the chemist has two unknown compounds, A and B. Each is treated with a different reducing agent: LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. The first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ gives (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second is B + BH3 + H+ gives (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, no, looking again: the first product is (R), the second is (S). So A is treated with LiBH4 to get R, B is treated with BH3 to get S.

I remember that the type of reducing agent can affect the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketone reductions. Oh, wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for converting carbonyl groups into alcohols. BH3 is another reducing agent, maybe as part of a different mechanism or in a different solvent.

Wait, but in the context of ketone reductions, I think that when using a borane-based reducing agent like BH3, it typically leads to a different stereochemistry compared to using LiBH4. Oh wait, no, wait. I think BH3 is used in the formation of secondary alcohols, perhaps via a different mechanism. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think.

Wait, LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3 is often used in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which is for alkenes to form alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition and specific stereochemistry. Oh wait, but in this case, the starting materials are not alkenes; they're something else. Wait, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-ones. That's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? It's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar
