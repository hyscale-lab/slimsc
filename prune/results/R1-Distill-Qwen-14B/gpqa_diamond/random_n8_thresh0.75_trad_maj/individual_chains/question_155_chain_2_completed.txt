Alright, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So, I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is a vector given by (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. 

The first thing I should do is compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I don't know if it's an eigenstate of P_z. Probably not, because P_x and P_z don't commute. So ⟨P_z⟩ is just the expectation value, not necessarily zero.

So, the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me write this as a column vector.

The operator P_z is given as a matrix with first row [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since ψ is a column vector, ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, let's compute each component:

The (1,1) element is ħ. So the first term is (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = ħ (1/4).

The (2,2) element is 0, so middle term is (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

The (3,3) element is -ħ. So the third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-ħ) * (1/4) → -ħ/4.

Adding these up: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That makes the calculation of ΔP_z a bit easier because then ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - 0) = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩).

So now I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just (P_z)^2, which is the same as the operator applied twice, but since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal with squares of the eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, computing ⟨P_z²⟩ would involve ψ† (P_z^2) ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z^2 is also diagonal, with elements (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → so the diagonal entries are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, the matrix P_z^2 is:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, ħ² ]

So, when I multiply ψ† (which is [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]) by P_z^2, the first element is (-1/2)*ħ², the second 0, and the third (-1/2)*ħ².

Wait, no. Let me think again. ψ is a column vector. So ψ† P_z² is a row vector. Wait, maybe I should compute each component.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term individually. So, the expectation value would be:

(ψ†)(P_z^2)(ψ) = sum_{i} ψ_i^* (P_z^2)_{i,j} ψ_j.

But since P_z^2 is diagonal, the only non-zero terms are when i=j.

So, it's sum_i ψ_i^* (P_z^2)_i,i ψ_i.

So for i=1: ψ_1 is -1/2, (P_z^2)_{1,1} is ħ², so term is (-1/2) * ħ² * (-1/2) = (ħ²)(1/4).

For i=2: (P_z^2)_{2,2} is 0, so term is zero.

For i=3: ψ_3 is -1/2, (P_z^2)_{3,3} is ħ², so term is (-1/2)*ħ²*(-1/2) = (ħ²)(1/4).

So adding the terms: 1/4 ħ² + 0 + 1/4 ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because the state ψ is already a column vector, and when we compute ψ† (P_z^2) ψ, each diagonal element is multiplied by the square of the corresponding amplitude.

Wait, another approach: the state is |ψ⟩ = a|e1⟩ + b|e2⟩ + c|e3⟩, where |e1⟩, |e2⟩, |e3⟩ are the eigenstates of P_z. Because the basis here is the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the question says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

So |e1⟩ is [1,0,0], |e2⟩ [0,1,0], |e3⟩ [0,0,1]. So the state is ψ = (-1/2)|e1⟩ + (1/√2)|e2⟩ + (-1/2)|e3⟩.

Since P_z acts on each eigenstate |e_i⟩ by multiplying by its eigenvalue. So, P_z |e1⟩ = ħ |e1⟩, P_z |e2⟩ = 0 |e2⟩, P_z |e3⟩ = -ħ |e3⟩.

Then, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ) = |a|^2 ħ - |c|^2 ħ.

Given a = -1/2, c = -1/2. So |a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |c|² = 1/4.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ = 0. Which matches what I found earlier.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|^2 (ħ)^2 + |b|^2 (0)^2 + |c|^2 (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). 

Wait, but wait. The options are given. Let me look back.

Options are:

A) sqrt(2) ħ

B) ħ / sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So the correct answer would be option B, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes I could make a mistake in signs or coefficients.

So, the state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Compute ⟨P_z⟩:

ψ† P_z ψ = (-1/2)* ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)* (-ħ) * (-1/2).

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First term: ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/√2 ) * 0 * (1/√2 ) = 0.

Third term: (-1/2 ) * (-ħ ) * (-1/2 ) = (1/2) * (-ħ) * (1/2) = (-ħ/4).

Wait, wait, no. Because P_z is diagonal, so when you multiply ψ† by P_z, you multiply each component.

Wait, perhaps I should use matrix multiplication correctly.

The state ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

P_z is the diagonal matrix:

[[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, -ħ ]]

So, P_z ψ is:

First component: ħ * (-1/2) = - ħ/2.

Second component: 0 * (1/√2 ) = 0.

Third component: -ħ * (-1/2) = ħ/2.

Then, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, ψ† (P_z ψ) is:

(-1/2) * (-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)

Compute each term:

First term: (1/2) * (ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Third term: (-1/2)*(ħ/2) = - ħ/4.

So total is ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Then, for ⟨P_z²⟩, we compute ψ† (P_z^2) ψ. 

P_z squared is:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, ħ² ]

So, P_z^2 ψ is:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ² / 2.

Second component: 0.

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ² / 2.

Then, ψ† (P_z^2 ψ) is:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2).

Compute each term:

First term: (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Third term: (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Adding them gives (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ², so the square root is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ in the basis of its eigenvectors. Thus, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Breaking this into terms:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar^2)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar^2)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Breaking this into terms:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar^2)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar^2)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
