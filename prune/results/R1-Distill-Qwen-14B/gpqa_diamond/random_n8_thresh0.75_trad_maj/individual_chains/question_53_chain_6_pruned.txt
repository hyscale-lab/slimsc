Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. 

So, first, the compound is di-substituted, which means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key functional group here.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's parse them out. Two signals are for aromatic protons. Wait, but a benzene ring with substituents can have different splitting. Since it's di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. But in a meta fashion or para? Or maybe one substituent is ortho and another para? Hmm, but the aromatic signals here are two, so maybe it's a para substitution? Or maybe one substituent is in a position that gives two equivalent protons, and the other substituent gives another two, but maybe in a different environment, leading to two signals.

Then there are two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are typically from alkenes or perhaps substituents like esters. Wait, esters usually have a carbonyl and an oxygen, but their structure is R-O-CO-O-R? No, esters are R-O-CO-R. So maybe the vinyl-Hs are part of a substituent attached to the ring. Like maybe an ester group has some vinyl protons.

Wait, maybe that's an allyl group or an ethyl group attached as the ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents include a vinyl group attached to the ester. Let's think: if the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester, and perhaps another group that's a vinyl.

Wait, but the NMR also mentions two signals for -CH3 groups. And no signals for -CH2 groups. So where are those CH3s coming from? Maybe the ester group has two CH3 groups. Or perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and another is an ester.

Wait, but the ester functional group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So for example, methyl acetate would be CH3-O-CO-CH2CH3 or something. Wait, no, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. So in that case, the ester has a CH3 from the acetyl group and a CH3 from the OCH3. But in the NMR, two CH3 signals. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR shows two -CH3 signals. So maybe the substituent has two different CH3 groups. Let me think about possible structures.

Alternatively,
