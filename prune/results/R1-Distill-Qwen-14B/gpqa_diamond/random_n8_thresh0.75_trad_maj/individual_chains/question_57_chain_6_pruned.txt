Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, elastic scattering, right? The question gives me some phase shifts and asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that phase shifts are important in scattering theory, especially in partial wave expansions.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀ = 90 degrees, δ₁ = 67 degrees, δ₂ = 55, δ₃ = 30, and δ₄ = 13 degrees. Oh, and the rest are ignored. So, I think each phase shift corresponds to a spherical harmonic or a Legendre polynomial in the partial wave expansion.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) involves a sum over the angular momentum quantum numbers l. The general expression is something like f = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) (sin δ_l / sin δ_l)^2 ) * something... Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ), and the imaginary part would come from the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, no, wait. The scattering amplitude is usually written as f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)/(sin δ_l) ) ] e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ). Wait, that's not right. Oh, perhaps the amplitude is f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ). Or wait, I think the standard form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ). 

Wait, I think I'm mixing different forms. Let me think. The partial wave expansion is f(θ, |k|) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ). But wait, that's for the scattering amplitude. Alternatively, I've also seen f written as (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) / (2i), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Wait, the question
