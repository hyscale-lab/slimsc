Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D with various steps. Hmm, I need to figure out the right order.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule. Let me see: it's a benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. So, the substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)
- Position 2: tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3)
- Position 3: nitro group (NO2)

Wait, is that correct? Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So benzene has three substituents. Let's arrange them: position 1 is next to position 2 and 6; position 2 is next to 1, 3, and 7 (which wraps around to 1, but that's not possible). Wait, no, benzene is a ring. If position 1 is ethoxy, the substituents go to positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row. So the ring has substituents at
