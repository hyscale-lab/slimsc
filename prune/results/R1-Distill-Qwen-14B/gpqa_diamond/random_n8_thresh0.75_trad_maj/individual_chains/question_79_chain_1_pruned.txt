Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR spectroscopy, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a type of catalyst used in certain reactions. Oh right, it's commonly used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from alkenes. So maybe compound X is an alkene that undergoes epoxidation here.

Compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me think about what that could be. The product after reaction would be an epoxide if it's Sharpless, but let's check the NMR data for the product.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen like a ketone or an epoxide. Wait, epoxide would have two adjacent protons, but a singlet here could also be a methyl attached to another structure.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet. Two methyl groups, each as singlets. That suggests that they are on different environments but each is not split.
- Then we have several signals in the aromatic region:
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d)
   - δ 7.08 (2H, d)
   - δ 7.68 (1H, d)
   - δ 7.71 (2H, d)
So four aromatic groups? Let me see. Wait, maybe it's a substituted styrene or something similar. Because in the 1H NMR, we have a doublet of doublets perhaps, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause coupling.

Wait, the aromatic signals are all doublets. That suggests they are part of a system where each proton is adjacent to another in a way that each has one neighboring proton. Hmm, maybe a di-substituted ring with specific substitution patterns.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- δ 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s): These are probably two methyl groups, maybe attached to something like a carbonyl or an oxygen. Like in an epoxide, the carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm, but these are lower. Wait, maybe they're attached to an oxygen elsewhere. Or perhaps they're part of a
