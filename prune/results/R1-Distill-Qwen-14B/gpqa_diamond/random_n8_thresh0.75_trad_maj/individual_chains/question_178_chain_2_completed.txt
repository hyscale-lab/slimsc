Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangian theory, and I'm a bit new to this so I'm trying to think it through step by step. The question is asking about the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the angular momentum in QFT, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

First, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ. In quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let me break down each part of the term:

- ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint, which has the same dimension as ψ. For a Dirac spinor, the dimension is [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ also has 3/2.
- σ_{μν} is a matrix constructed from the commutator of gamma matrices. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}]_M =0.
- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field. The field tensor F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, where Aμ is the gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 (because it's like a derivative term when you write down the kinetic term for a gauge field, which is (∂A)^2, so (∂ has dimension 1, A must be 1 to make (∂A) dimension 2, squared gives 4 for the term to match the Lagrangian's dimension 4). So F, being two derivatives acting on A, would have dimension 2. Wait, no: each derivative adds 1, and A is dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂μ Aν → dimension 1 + 1 =2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ F would have each component's dimensions multiplied. So dimensions:

κ × [ψ̄] × [σ] × [F] = κ × (3/2) × 0 × 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is κ multiplied by each factor. But σ_{μν} is dimensionless, as I thought, so [σ_{μν}] =0. So the dimensions become:

κ × (3/2) × (dimension of ψ, which is 3/2) × (dimension of F, which is 2).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, each ψ has 3/2. So product of ψ̄ and ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then σ is dimensionless, so that part doesn't add anything. Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the entire term without κ is:

(3/2) * (3/2) * 1 * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then F is 2. So the total without κ is 3 * 2 =6.

Wait, because the product is ψ̄ (3/2) * ψ (3/2) * F (2) → (3/2 +3/2 + 2) → 3 +2=5? No, no, wait: each field contributes its dimension, multiplied. The product is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Because each field's dimension is multiplied together. So:

(3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4. Multiply by F's dimension 2: (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. So the entire term's dimension is 9/2. But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the product of κ and the other terms (9/2) must equal 4. So:

κ × (9/2) =4 → κ= (4) / (9/2) )= 8/9. Wait, but that's the mass dimension.

Wait, no, wait: I think I made a mistake. Because the entire term is κ multiplied by the product of ψ̄, ψ, F, and σ. But σ is dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute.

So the term is κ * [ψ̄] [ψ] [F] = κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

So (3/2)^2 is 9/4, times 2 is (9/4)*2 = 9/2. So 9/2 =4. So 9/2=4 implies κ= (4) / (9/2) )= 8/9? Wait, but that's not possible; that would make κ dimensionful in mass terms. But wait, that's the point: the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ * (9/2)] must equal 4. So [κ] + [9/2] =4 → [κ] =4 - (9/2) )= (8/2 -9/2) )= -1/2.

Wait, but that can't be right because I've seen similar terms before. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's compute the dimension of each part again.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made from [γ matrices], which are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless.

F^{μν} has dimension 2, because it's ∂μ Aν, and A is dimension 1. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F is (∂A) which is dimension 2.

So now the term is: κ * [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}]

So substituting:

κ has [κ], ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2.

So the total dimension is [κ] + 3/2 +0 +3/2 + 2.

Adding those: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5 + [κ] = 4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, that makes sense. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. The rule of thumb is that a coupling with positive mass dimension is super-renormalizable, dimension zero is renormalizable, and negative dimension is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The general rule is:

In a term L ~ g φ^n, the dimension of the coupling g is [g] =4 - (n × [φ]_M).

If [g] ≥ 0, the interaction is renormalizable. If [g] <0, it's non-renormalizable.

So for our case, ψ is a Dirac spinor with [ψ]_M=3/2.

The term is L ~ κ ψ̄ ψ F.

Wait, but F is the field strength, which is a field in itself. Wait, wait, wait — no, wait. Wait, the term given is L = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So it's a term involving two ψ's and an F. Alternatively, perhaps each F is a field, but in any case, perhaps it's easier to think of the term as a four-dimensional operator with certain scaling.

But perhaps another approach is to think in terms of the interaction term. The term involves ψ, ψ, and F. So in terms of operators, it's like (ψψ F), but wait, more precisely, it's a product of ψ̄, σμν, ψ, and Fμν.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is higher-dimensional if the coupling has negative mass dimension.

Since we found [κ]_M = -1, which is negative. So the interaction is of dimension 4 + [κ] = 4-1 =3. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: The term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian is an operator of dimension 4. The term in question is a product of ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

We calculated that without κ, the product has dimension 4 + 1? Wait, no, wait: [ψ̄]=3/2, [ψ]=3/2, [σ]=0, [F]=2. So 3/2 +3/2 +0 +2 = 3+2=5. So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F] has dimension 5. Then, including κ, the term has dimension [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, for renormalizability: the coupling needs to have dimension ≥0. Since [κ]=-1, which is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because in a renormalizable theory, the dimension of the coupling g must be ≥0. So a negative dimension implies that the theory is non-renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No, because if [κ] is negative, not renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, let me double-check. For a term L = g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g]=4 - (n [φ]). If [g] ≥0, renormalizable. If [g] <0, non-renormalizable.

In our case, the interaction term is of the form κ (ψ ψ F), but perhaps more accurately, the operator is (ψ̄ σ F ψ). But regardless, the coupling κ has dimension [κ]=-1. So the interaction term is dimension 4 (as required), but the coupling has negative dimension.

So the theory would be non-renormalizable because you can't have a dimensionless (or positive dimension) coupling. So the correct option is C: [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, ren → no.

B) [κ]=1, ren → no.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren → yes.

D) [κ]=1, not ren → no.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$). Breaking down the dimensions of each term:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is dimensionless, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

The total dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Including the coupling constant $\kappa$, the Lagrangian term must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension ($[\kappa]_M \geq 0$). Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$ in this case, the theory is **not renormalizable**. Non-renormalizable theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them less predictive at higher energy scales.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as a negative mass dimension implies non-renormalizability.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the calculated dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
