Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as X with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think X is the symbol for lithium, so maybe it's Li-6 or Li-7? Wait, wait, Li has 3 protons normally. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 (since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6). So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The problem is about relativistic energy, right? So I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, and their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh yeah, so we'll need to use the relativistic energy formulas.

First, I think I need to find the total relativistic energy of the nucleus and then subtract the rest mass energy to get the kinetic energy, which would be the energy the collider imparts. Or wait, wait no, the question is about the energy of the collider. So maybe the total energy (relativistic) is what we're looking for, or perhaps the kinetic energy. I'll have to be careful here.

So the formula for the total relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The speed v is given as 0.96c. So let's compute gamma first.

Let me write that
