Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system here. Because both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are phosphate salts, they should form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, and they can be used to calculate pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So maybe I don't directly need the pH, but perhaps the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- will help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Let me think. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-. So the relevant pKa would be Ka2, which is the second ionization. Wait, no, because
