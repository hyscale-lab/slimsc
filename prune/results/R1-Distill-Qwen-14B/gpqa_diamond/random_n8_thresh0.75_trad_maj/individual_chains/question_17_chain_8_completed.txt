Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a stable complex because of the large formation constant. Wait, the formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty big number. That means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free calcium ions should be really low because almost all the calcium is tied up in the complex.

Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex... that means the formula is CaY^2- or something like that. EDTA is usually Y^4-, and calcium is Ca^2+, so the complex would be CaY^2-. So the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formation of the complex is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- (the complex). The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions.

So, if the complex dissociates, it would release Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- in solution. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be very small.

Let me think about the expression. The formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is 5x10^10. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Wait, but in solution, EDTA comes from its various forms due to pH. Oh wait, the problem says the pH is ideal. So I can assume that the EDTA is in its Y^4- form. That's an important assumption because EDTA's speciation depends on pH. So in this case, I don't have to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA. So the [EDTA^4-] is just the same as the concentration of free EDTA, which I'll call [Y^4-].

So, the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Let me denote [Ca^2+] as x. Then, since each complex releases one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- when it dissociates, the [EDTA^4-] would also be x, assuming that the initial EDTA concentration is negligible compared to the complex.

Wait, but wait. The complex is 0.02 M, so if it dissociates a little, each mole gives one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the concentrations would be [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. The complex is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 since x is very small.

So the Kf expression is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] ) 

So plugging in the numbers:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x² 

Then, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Wait, 5e10 is 5 x 10^10, so 0.02 /5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = 2/(5e12) ) = 0.4e-12, so wait, 2e-2 is 0.02, so 0.02 /5e10 = 0.02 /5 * 1e-10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(10^-13)=10^(-6.5). So 2e-6.5 M. But wait, 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Kf is 5e10, and [complex] is 0.02 M. So if [Ca^2+] is x, then [EDTA] is x as well, so Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10. Solving for x^2: x^2=0.02/(5e10)= (0.02)/(5e10) = 4e-13. x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= approx 6.32e-7, which matches option C.

I think that's correct. The other options: option A is 2e-2, which is the concentration of the complex, so not the calcium. Option D is 1e-2, which is 10 times A. No, that's higher than expected. Option B is 5e-3, which is larger than our calculated x, but wait, no, 5e-3 is 0.005, which is much larger than 6.3e-7. So option C is the only one close.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the pH is ideal (so \(\text{EDTA}\) is fully deprotonated as \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)), the dissociation of the complex releases equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \(x\). Then, \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) and \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) since \(x\) is expected to be very small due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(2.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\):** This is the concentration of the complex, not free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\).
- **B) \(5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\):** Too large compared to the calculated value.
- **C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\):** Matches the calculated concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\).
- **D) \(1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\):** Too large compared to the calculated value.

The correct answer is **C**.
