Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can be a bit tricky for me. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I should figure out what's happening in each step. So, let me write down the given data.

Initial volume of acetic acid (CH3COOH): 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L
Concentration of acetic acid: 0.05 M
Volume of water added: 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L
So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L.

Wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration should be 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me double-check that calculation.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. When you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So at the equivalence point, how much NaOH will be needed?

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1. So moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point: moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait
