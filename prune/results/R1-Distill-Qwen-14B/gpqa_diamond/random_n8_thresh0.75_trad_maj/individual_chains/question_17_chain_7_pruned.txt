Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or pH affecting the EDTA's ability to complex the calcium.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K value like 5e10 means the complex is very stable.

Wait, when EDTA (which I think is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-) complexes with Ca²+, the reaction is something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

So, let me think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The K expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the
