Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄^3-.

The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, so I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Since the solution has KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, those are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. So how do the given substances relate to that?

Wait, no. Wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but sometimes it's used to refer to PO4^3-? Or maybe the term is a bit ambiguous. I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

But in the solution, we have KH₂PO4 and Na₂HPO4·2H2O. So KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (because K+ is the cation), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is the cation). So these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions.

Wait, but the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-? So I have to find [PO4^3-]. How?

I think this relates to the phosphate buffer system. Since both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are present, maybe they form a buffer. But wait, no. Let me think about their positions in the dissociation steps.
