Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe it's for something else. Oh right, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Or wait, could it be a dehydrohalogenation? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The problem gives me both IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's start by looking at these spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know the structure, I can better predict what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines or amides). But the presence of 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is typical for esters, ketones, or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, but also a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H and a strong carbonyl around 1700.

Wait, but let's check the other peaks. There's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. And 1450 cm-1, that could be C-O stretching in an ester or something else.

The 1H NMR data: Let me list them.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, the IR didn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 which is typical for O-H in carboxylic acids, but maybe it's a broad peak that's not very sharp. Hmm, the IR has 3400–2500, which is a broad region, but does that include O-H? Or perhaps it's an alcohol or an amine.

Wait, looking at the NMR again: 10.5 ppm is a singlet, broad. That might not fit aldehyde because aldehydes are usually a triplet or singlet but maybe that's possible. Wait, no, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12, but in the case of a conjugated system, maybe it's lower. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but then what about the other data.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The protons are each two doublets, so maybe two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, the two doublets each have 2H, which suggests perhaps a group attached to the ring in a para position. For example, in para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene or perhaps a substituent with two protons each, like a carbonyl group? Or maybe a substituent that's a group with two protons, such as a CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, but the substituent could be an acyl group. Let's think: if the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, maybe one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and the other is something else? Or perhaps each substituent is a group with two protons, like a -CH2- group. Hmm, but looking at the NMR, the downfield shifts in the aromatic region (8.0 and 7.2 ppm) suggest that the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups. Because electron-withdrawing groups would deshield the aromatic protons, making them appear downfield.

So, for example, a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) would be a meta-directing group. If the substituent is a carbonyl, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. So in a para-substituted benzene, substituents like two carbonyl groups would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets. Alternatively, substituents like nitro groups would do the same, but nitro groups are usually more downfield.

But wait, looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 and 7.2. That's a typical pattern for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, if you have a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the neighboring (ortho) protons would be downfield.

Wait, another thought: if the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating 2H, that suggests that the two substituents are in the para positions. Wait, no, because in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would be opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets. But wait, if the substituent is something like a carbonyl group, then the ring would have two substituents? Or is there another possibility.

Wait, perhaps it's a monosubstituted benzene. Wait, no, because the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with 2H. Wait, maybe the substituent is a group that has two protons, such as a -CH2- group attached to the ring. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2COOR group or something like that, then the splitting might be due to that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-methyl group. But a para-methyl would cause the aromatic protons to split into a certain pattern. But in that case, you'd have a singlet for the methyl, and the aromatic protons would be two doublets.

Wait, let's think of the substituents. The NMR shows 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So, the two sets of doublets each have two protons. So, perhaps the substituent is a group that's attached to the ring, and each substituent has two protons. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2- group attached to something else.

Wait, but if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone, then that would be a single substituent. But then, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituent is a group like -COCH2R, then the protons adjacent to the substituent would be split.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a substituent that's an aldehyde group. But that's not likely because the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 1H. If that's an aldehyde, that would make sense. But then, what about the rest?

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet with 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a CH2 or a CH. For example, a -CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. Because the aldehyde is at 10.5 ppm. Then, the benzene ring has substituents. Let's think about the substituents.

The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with 2H. Let's say the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, but that might not explain the splitting. Alternatively, if the substituent is a group like -CH2COOR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain attached to the ring, but that might not explain the NMR.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a ketone or an ester, then perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, one being a carbonyl group (like a methyl ketone) and another being an aldehyde group. But that would complicate the IR, which shows strong peaks in certain regions.

Wait, going back to the IR. The peaks are 3400–2500 (broad), 1720, 1610, 1450. The 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with a ketone substituent.

But wait, benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which is a bit higher than usual for an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. Because conjugation can shift the aldehyde proton downfield.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. But let's think about the NMR.

Wait, the 1H NMR also has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. Maybe a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2-CO-Ph. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible substituents based on the NMR. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a ethyl group attached to a CH2. Because a triplet at the end of a chain (like CH2CH2CH3) would have a triplet for the terminal CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another group. Because a doublet for 3H is typical for a methyl attached to a CH2, such as in a -CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let's think of a possible substituent. Let's imagine the benzene ring has a substituent that's a propyl group attached to another group. For example, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is likely a methyl attached to a CH2, so maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. But the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a triplet, which indicates it's a methyl at the end of a chain. So maybe it's a propyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. But the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the middle CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring via a carbonyl group. For example, something like Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: The IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1610 is probably the ring's C=C, and the 1450 could be C-O stretching, perhaps in an ester or ketone. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be part of a CH2CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a ketone, like (CH2)2CO-R. Or perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the structure. Let me think of a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which explains the 10.5 ppm peak. The other substituent is a group that has a chain leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like -COCH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain attached via an oxygen. Maybe a phenyl acetate or something similar? But the IR doesn't show a strong ester peak. The ester carbonyl is around 1720, which is present.

Wait, if the substituent is an ester group, like -COO-R, then that would fit. But then the NMR doesn't show the ester oxygen's neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CO-R group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let me think: the substituent might be a group like -(CH2)2COCH3, but that would be a butyl group leading to a ketone.

Wait, putting it all together: The benzene has a substituent which is a ketone. The IR at 1720 cm-1 supports a carbonyl, probably a ketone (since esters are also around 1720, but maybe the pattern would differ). The NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (1H, m), which could be the CH next to the ketone. Then 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be the adjacent CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CO- group, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction. The reagent is red phosphorus and HI. That's a classic reaction for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, but if that's the case, then the starting material must have a nitrile group. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2200 cm-1, which is typical for nitriles. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but I don't see any evidence of a double bond in the IR. The IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could be C=C in an aromatic ring. So perhaps the starting material is an alkyne. But no, the IR doesn't show the typical peaks for an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in substitution reactions, maybe for the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, another reaction I remember is the use of red phosphorus to convert alcohols to chlorides. Wait, but that's usually with PCl5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Mitsunobu reaction, but that's for forming ethers and typically uses DEAD and triphenylphosphine. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Staudinger reaction, but that's for azides. So perhaps the initial thought about nitriles is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but again, the IR doesn't show a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus back on the NMR and IR. Let me try to find the structure of Compound X.

IR:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: broad, could be O-H or N-H.

But in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, singlet). If it's an O-H, like an alcohol, that would fit, but an alcohol's O-H is usually broader and more downfield than 10 ppm. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, then it's a sharp peak but about 9-10 ppm. Wait, but the aldehyde would be around 9.5-10 ppm, and 10.5 is a bit higher. It could be an acidic proton, like in a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a very strong peak around 2500-3300 for O-H. The 3400–2500 is a broad region, which could include O-H, but maybe it's from an alcohol.

However, the presence of a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 suggests a ketone or ester or aldehyde. But an aldehyde would have a peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch as well. The IR here doesn't show that, so perhaps it's not an aldehyde.

Wait, the IR might have peaks for O-H (3400-2500, broad) and a carbonyl (1720). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H (broad) and a carbonyl. But wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak in the 1-5 ppm region, which would be typical for a carboxylic acid's -OH. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which might be more consistent with an aldehyde or an acidic proton elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a ketone. Let's say the structure is 4-phenyl-3-butenal or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in that case, the IR should show a strong O-H stretch, which it does in the 3400-2500 region. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would be something like benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent. Let me think: the NMR for a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H. That fits with the NMR data: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

So, the benzene ring is para-substituted with a -COOH group and another substituent. But wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl (usually around 1700 cm-1). So, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and another group.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid's O-H. But wait, the carboxylic acid's O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So the substituent on the benzene is a -COOH group in the para position relative to another substituent.

What about the other substituent? Looking at the NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to the carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl, perhaps in an ethyl chain.

So, the substituent could be a propyl group attached via a carbonyl. Or perhaps a group like -COO-R, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group. But that would make the substituent a ketone, not an ester. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong peak for an ester, unless the 1720 cm-1 is from the ketone.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a ketone. The structure would then be benzene with a -COOH group and a -CO-R group in the para positions. But that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH2CH3 group. So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and a -CH2COCH2CH3 group in the para positions.

But let's see. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, singlet) which would be the O-H of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests the substituents are in para positions. The other substituent is a group that includes a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 adjacent to the same carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group attached via a ketone. So the substituent would be -COCH2CH2CH2CH3? That would make the substituent a ketone with a longer chain.

Wait, but the NMR has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H). A doublet at 1.4 ppm for 3H suggests a methyl attached to a CH2. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is a terminal methyl, so perhaps an ethyl group.

So putting it together, maybe the substituent is a -CH2COCH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2COCH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH2CH3 group. Let me see.

If the substituent is a ketone, say, -COCH2CH2CH3, then the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH next to the carbonyl, and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the adjacent CH2 group. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH2, which is part of a longer chain. Wait, but in -COCH2CH2CH3, the last CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which matches the 0.9 ppm (t,3H). The CH2 next to that would be a quartet, but the NMR doesn't show that. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent might be -COCH2CH(CH3)2. Let me think: that would give a structure where the substituent is a ketone attached to a branched chain. The CH group adjacent to the carbonyl would show up at around 2.9 ppm, the CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet or something else.

But maybe the substituent is a propyl chain. For example, the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group. So the carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1. The CH2 groups would be split into a quartet and triplet in the NMR. But in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which could be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a multiplet, which could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but in -COCH2CH2CH3, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet (split by the neighboring CH2). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-O-R group, which would be an ester. Then, the carbonyl would be around 1720. But then the O-R group would show up in the NMR as a triplet or something. But the NMR doesn't show a peak around 4 ppm which is typical for OCH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-R group where R is another group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOH group. Then, the benzene ring would have a -COOH (carboxylic acid) in one para position and a -CH2CH2COOH in the other. But that seems unlikely because the NMR doesn't show peaks that would fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group, but again, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH3 group. So, the substituent is a methyl ketone. Let me see: the CH3 would be a singlet in the NMR. But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH2. So perhaps it's a -CH2COCH2CH3 group. Wait, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CO- group. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2CH(CH3)2 group. Let me think: the CH adjacent to the carbonyl would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, m). The CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet for the CH2 groups, but not sure. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl groups attached to the CH.

Wait, but the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which is more like a single methyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent is a butyl group attached via a ketone. The NMR would have the CH2 next to the ketone (2.9 ppm, 1H), the adjacent CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), then the next CH2 (maybe around 1.4, but it's a doublet for 3H, which doesn't fit because the last CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group, which is a propyl ketone. Then, the NMR would have peaks for the CH2 next to the carbonyl (2.9 ppm, 1H?), but wait, that's a CH2 group, which would typically be a triplet if adjacent to another CH2. But the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, so maybe it's a CH group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the molecular formula or possible structure that fits the given NMR.

The NMR shows 7 signals, but more importantly, the integration: 1H, 2H, 2H, 1H, 3H, 3H.

So, total H: 1 + 2 + 2 +1 +3 +3 = 12 H.

But wait, the aromatic protons are 4H (2H each), so 4H. The others are 8H. But wait, the given data:

- 10.5: 1H

-8.0: 2H

-7.2: 2H

-2.9: 1H

-1.7: 2H

-1.4:3H

-0.9:3H

Total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=14. So molecular formula must have 14 H.

So, the structure would have 14 H.

If the benzene ring is para-substituted, each substituent would account for some H.

Assuming the substituents are -COOH and another group, let's say R.

The benzene ring has 4 H (since it's para-substituted), so substituents account for the remaining H.

-COOH has no H (well, the O-H is present, but the COOH group itself doesn't add H beyond that). So the other substituent R would account for the rest.

The substituent R has 10 H (since 14 - 4 = 10 H). Let's check the substituent's NMR peaks.

Looking at the substituent peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (1H)

- 1.7 ppm (2H)

- 1.4 (3H)

- 0.9 (3H)

So that's 1+2+3+3=9 H. Hmm, but the substituent R has 10 H. So maybe I'm missing one H. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is something like -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) with a branch. Let me think: the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. The structure would be:

Ph-CO-O-R, but that's for an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COO- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COCH3 group. Let me see:

The structure would be benzene with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH2COCH3 group in the para positions. Then, the substituent would have a CH2COCH3. The NMR would show the CH2 next to the carbonyl (maybe 2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, 3H), but that doesn't fit because the CH3 would be a triplet if it's at the end.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. Hmm, but that would complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH2CH3 group. So, the substituent is a propyl ketone: -COCH2CH2CH3.

In that case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl (CO) would have a triplet at around 2.3 ppm. But the NMR shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet for 1H. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH adjacent to the carbonyl would be a CH group (1H) at around 2.9 ppm. The CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet for the two CH3 groups. But the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), which would fit a methyl attached to a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH2 would have a triplet, and the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH2CH3 group. Then, the structure would be a butyl ketone. The NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the CO at ~2.4 ppm (quartet, 2H)

- The next CH2 at ~1.6 ppm (triplet, 2H)

- The last CH2 at ~1.0 ppm (quartet, 2H)

But the given NMR doesn't show these. Instead, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), and 0.9 (3H). This doesn't match a straight chain butted to the CO.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, a CH with a propyl chain attached. Then, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, m). The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (2H, m). The end CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H, t). But the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH2. So maybe the substituent is a -COCH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but in this case, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have a CH2CH2CH3 attached. The NMR would have:

- CH at 2.9 ppm (m,1H)

- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) at 1.7 ppm (m,2H)

- The next CH2 at 1.4 ppm (m, 2H)

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me think of the possible structures based on the options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position. Benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would show up in the IR as a broad O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. The aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think: The butyl group can be in different positions. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- with the substituent on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is: CH2CH(CH3)CH2- as the substituent. So, attached to the benzene ring would be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? Wait, no, because that would imply a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Benzoic acid: COOH attached to benzene. The substituent is in the para position. The substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. That would make the substituent a three-carbon chain, with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), which is in the data.

The substituent's protons would include:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: maybe around 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-CO-OH (benzoic acid) and a para substituent of -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

The substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: the protons here are on a CH2 group. The next CH has a methyl group attached. The last CH2 has a methyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR for the substituent:

The substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is four carbons? Or perhaps it's a three-carbon group with a methyl branch.

Wait, no, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which has four carbons. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a substituent on the benzene. Let me clarify.

Wait, the substituent is a butyl group. The term 'sec-butyl' refers to the position of the substituent on the butyl chain. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think correctly: The butyl group has four carbons. The 'sec' refers to the position where the substituent is attached. So, for a sec-butyl group, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Butyl groups can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

The four carbons in a butyl group can be arranged as:

n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

iso-butyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, no, iso-butyl is when the branch is on the second carbon: -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's instead look at the NMR data for the substituent:

The substituent has:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H)

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H)

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H)

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H)

So, what substituent would give this?

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group. That's the end of an ethyl chain.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH2.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) is a CH2 group.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a CH group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. That would be a tert-butyl group? No, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that would give a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, which would have a CH2 adjacent to a CH(CH3). The CH(CH3) would have two CH2 groups attached.

Wait, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (maybe 2.9 ppm, 1H, but it's a CH2 group, so possibly a triplet)

- The CH(CH3) next to it would have protons that might show up around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group: -CH2CH2CH3, but that would give a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (2H), and a triplet at 2.9 ppm (2H). But in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which doesn't fit a CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that wouldn't explain the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (2H, m), the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, m), and the two CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 6H?), but that doesn't fit the data either.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COCH2CH3 group. Then, the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 next to the CO (2.9 ppm, 1H), the adjacent CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), and the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (3H, triplet). But the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH2, which would be the case if there's a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but in that structure, the substituent would be a ketone: -COCH2CH2CH3.

So, putting it all together, the structure would be 4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid, which is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, which is itself attached to a carboxylic acid group in the para position.

So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH (with Ph being a benzene ring) and a para substituent of -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), which matches.

- The substituent's CH2 attached to the ring would be a triplet, but the given data has 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H). Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a multiplet because of coupling with adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that doesn't fit the data either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), and the two CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 6H). But the given data only has 3H at 1.4 ppm.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the CH2 groups would split into different peaks.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's look at the reaction again.

The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. So, the reaction is likely a substitution or elimination. But earlier, I thought it might be a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but the IR didn't show a nitrile peak.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the hydroboration of an alkene, but I don't see evidence of an alkene in the IR (no peak around 1650 cm-1 for C=C in an alkene; the 1610 is probably aromatic C=C).

Wait, maybe the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 3300 cm-1 for sp-hybridized C-H.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's for carbocation shifts.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the reaction. Let's think: If the initial compound is a nitrile, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak. So maybe the initial compound has a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to a carbonyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxide cleavage of alkenes. For example, in the cleavage of vicinal dihalides to ketones or carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the elimination of HX from a halide to form an alkene. But that usually involves strong bases, not HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group with HI. For example, if Compound X is a benzyl halide, HI could substitute the halide with an iodide. But then the product would be a benzyl iodide, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, if Compound X is a tosylate or mesylate, HI would substitute it to form a benzyl iodide. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an ester. But the IR doesn't show a strong ester peak besides the carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Let me think of the reaction as a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's a synthesis reaction, not a reaction with reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from a carboxylic acid, but that usually involves SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid, but that would require water, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that usually involves H2 and a catalyst.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the reaction part. Maybe I should focus on figuring out what the starting material is, and then see what the reaction would do.

Assuming that the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are usually used to reduce nitriles to amines. But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction would not proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. For example, if the starting material is a vicinal dihalide, treating with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate to form an alkene. But I don't see any halogen in the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl halide, and the reaction is elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond. But again, the options don't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group with iodide. If Compound X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, HI would substitute it to form an iodide. But the options don't include any iodides.

Wait, let's think about the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this, and the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile, that doesn't make sense because it's already a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. Let me think: If the starting material is a nitrile, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then treating with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

So, the reaction would be nitrile + HI and red phosphorus → carboxylic acid.

So, if the starting material is a nitrile, then the product would be the corresponding carboxylic acid.

But in the NMR data, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde or an acidic proton (like a carboxylic acid). But in the NMR of a carboxylic acid, the O-H would typically appear as a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which fits the 10.5 peak.

So, if the starting material is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C.

Wait, but in the IR data, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's a nitrile, the IR would show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present. So, perhaps the starting material is not a nitrile.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to reevaluate.

If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't do much. But maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the carboxylic acid group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. The reaction might hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction converts the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. But how?

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for oxidation. More commonly, oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or CrO3 are used.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. But without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the addition of HI to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an iodo compound via nucleophilic substitution. If the starting material has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, then reacting with HI would substitute it with iodide. But the options don't show an iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne to form a diiodide, but again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the reaction. Let me go back to the starting material.

If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: The IR and NMR data suggest that the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a ketone substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cinnamic acid derivative, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this, then the reaction might be something else. But the reaction is stated to occur between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the starting material is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But then, the IR and NMR would be for the nitrile, not the acid.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize:

The IR of Compound X shows O-H (broad) and a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which could be a carboxylic acid's O-H.

The aromatic protons are two doublets (each 2H), suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

The other protons suggest a substituent with a chain leading to a terminal methyl group.

So, the substituent is likely a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, making the substituent a sec-butyl group.

Thus, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, the reaction: when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, I think I might have this wrong earlier. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But in this case, if the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction wouldn't change it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is the carboxylic acid. So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Data Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a broad O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching.
- **1450 cm⁻¹**: Likely C-O stretching.

### NMR Data Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH₂.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

### Structural Interpretation:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons confirm a para-substitution pattern, and the substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals:
- The **sec-butyl group** contributes the following signals:
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
  - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
  - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Methyl group attached to the CH₂.
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Terminal methyl group of the ethyl chain.

Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI. These reagents are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since the starting material is already a carboxylic acid (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), no further reaction occurs under these conditions. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, corresponding to **Option C**.
