Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. So, each compound listed must be checked for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism, but wait, geometric isomerism (like cis-trans) isn't about optical activity, right? So optical isomerism is specifically about molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light, which requires chirality.

Let's look at each option one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Hmm, the structure here is a biphenyl group. That means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The nitro groups are on the 6' positions, and the carboxylate ester groups are on the 2' positions. Wait, but the central bond is a single bond. So, the question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not. If the two substituents on each ring make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it could be chiral.

Wait, in biphenyls, if there's a substituent on each ring such that the arrangement is symmetric, the molecule might not be chiral. But if the substituents create a different arrangement on each side, making it impossible to be superimposed on the mirror image, then it would have optical isomers.

Looking at the substituents: each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. Since the biphenyl is 1,1', the positions are such that each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. Wait, but for a biphenyl, the positions are in relation to the connecting bond. So perhaps each ring has a nitro at para to the ester group. Wait, maybe the arrangement is such that the substituents are in symmetrical positions on each ring, but considering the biphenyl's structure, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, the nitro groups are both at 6 on each ring, and the ester groups at 2 on each. So, are the substituents on each ring mirror images?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me try to imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, which are across from each other. So, each ring's substituents are in a para arrangement. But because the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry down the center. So when you mirror it, it's the same. So would this compound have optical isomerism? Wait, maybe not. Unless the two substituents create different environments on each side.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl ester groups on each ring. Maybe the arrangement leads to axial chirality. Wait, biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the rings are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the two rings have different groups in each position. But in this case, both rings have the same substituents—nitro and ester. So, would that create a plane of symmetry? Because each ring is identical in substituents and their arrangement.

Wait, if the two rings are identical in substituents but connected via a single bond, then the entire molecule would be symmetrical. So, the molecule would be achiral, meaning no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Each ring has a nitro and an ester group. But the positions are 2 and 6 on each ring, which are opposite each other. So, each ring is symmetric, and the two rings are identical. So the whole molecule is symmetric, meaning it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism here. So option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. I remember that for biphenyls to be chiral, the substituents must not be symmetrical. So if each ring has two substituents that are mirror images of each other across the biphenyl axis, then the molecule is achiral. So in this case, with both rings being identical, it's symmetrical, so no chiral centers or axial chirality. So no optical isomerism for compound 1. So 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

Let me draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester. So, the structure is O
           |
O-C-O-CH2-C-OH
           |
           CH3 ?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but methyl ester would replace the -OH with OMe. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the acid, but methyl ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3. But if it's 2-hydroxy, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, 2-hydroxy propanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So the ester is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the acid. The ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. For 2-hydroxy, the OH is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's the structure. So the molecule is:

O
|
O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbons are: methyl (CH3), then a CH(OH), then COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that's possible. So, the carbons are arranged as:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that's four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Propanoate is three carbons: propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would have the structure R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, for methyl ester, it would be CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester, methyl propionate, is CH3CH2COOCH3. But in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the second carbon of the propionate. So, structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, I think I'm messing this up. Let me try again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-: so, the chain is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propionate. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons in a row: CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, that's not right because propionate only has three carbons. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's number from the COO group:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3?

No, that would make it a three-carbon chain, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's:

CH3-COO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Hmm, but wait, that's a four-carbon chain, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, that's three carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about it as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, the propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Position 2 is the middle CH2. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be the methyl ester: HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, looking for chiral centers: the hydroxy is on the second carbon. Let's see the groups attached to that carbon. The second carbon is connected to:

- One CH2 group (from the COOCH3 side)
- One OH group
- One CH3 group from the other side? Wait, no, wait the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH2, so that carbon is CH2; wait, no, wait the structure is O

Wait, am I getting the structure wrong? Let me think again. If the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the second carbon (the one attached to OH) is CH2. So each of those CH2 groups—so the second carbon is in the middle, connected to:

- One CH2(OH) group
- One CH2COOCH3 group

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Now, looking at each carbon. The central CH2 group (the second carbon) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (one to the OH, one to the COOCH3)
- Two H's.

Wait, if that's the case, then that carbon is CH2, which has two H's and two CH2 groups attached. So, four substituents: two H, one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because each bond is to a carbon or an atom. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a different structure. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3O)OCOCH2CH2OH. So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH2-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no. Wait, it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are arranged as:

COOCH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH2OH group.

So, the central CH2 is attached to the COOCH3 group on one side and the CH2OH on the other. But each CH2 is a carbon with two H's.

Wait, but the central carbon (the one adjacent to the COOCH3) would have the structure:

- One bond to COOCH3,
- One bond to CH2OH,
- Two H's.

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. Oh, wait, no. Let's correct. The structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the CH2) is connected to:

- One CH2(OH) group,
- One CH2(COOCH3) group,
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would mean four substituents: two H's, a CH2OH, and a CH2COOCH3. So that's four groups, which is correct. So, does this carbon have four different groups attached?

Wait, the substituents are: H, H, CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. But wait, the CH2OH is attached to the same carbon as the CH2COOCH3?

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2, connected to:

- One CH2(OH) group (so, two H's and one OH on that CH2)
- One CH2-COOCH3 group (two H's and the COOCH3 group)
- Wait, but each of those is connected via a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, and the carbon is actually CH with different substituents.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me try to count the substituents around each carbon.

Looking at the central carbon (the one attached to the OH): it's the second carbon. So:

- One bond to the first carbon (CH2OH group)
- One bond to the third carbon (which is connected to the COOCH3)
- Two H's.

Wait, so the substituents are:

- Two H's,
- CH2OH (which is a group with an -OH),
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a propionyl group attached to OMe).

Wait, but wait, that would make the substituents: H, H, CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. So, are any of these the same? The H's are same, so the substituents are H, H, (CH2OH), (CH2COOCH3). So, the central carbon has two identical substituents (H), so can it be a chiral center?

Wait, for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. If two substituents are H's, then it can't be chiral. So, the central carbon has two H's, making it impossible for that carbon to be a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism here. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the OH is on the same carbon as the ester. For example, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, but that would be a different compound. Wait, but according to the name, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxy is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think about propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, in the methyl ester, it's CH2CH2COOCH3. If the hydroxy is on the second carbon (the middle CH2), then the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the middle carbon is CH2 with the substituents: two H's, a CH2OH, and a CH2COOCH3. So, as before, two H's, so the substituents are not all different. So, no chiral center. Therefore, option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What if the structure is different? Like, maybe the OH is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group, making the central carbon a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. In that case, the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the second carbon (the one with the OH) has:

- One CH3 group,
- One OH group,
- One COOCH3 group,
- And one H.

So, substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. All four substituents are different. So, this would be a chiral center, implying optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in determining the structure. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the second carbon has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That's four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has optical isomerism.

So, option 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**

Benzophenone is (Ph)COPh, where Ph is a benzene ring. So, it's a diketone with two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. The structure is O=C-(Ph)2. So, the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. The carbonyl carbon has no hydrogens and is connected to two benzene rings and an oxygen.

In terms of chirality, the carbonyl group is trigonal planar, not a chiral center because it's double-bonded and doesn't have four different substituents. Additionally, benzophenone doesn't have any other chiral centers. So, it's symmetrical, with two identical benzene rings on either side of the carbonyl. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**

Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is a trans-dihydroxy derivative. Its structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. When it's the dimethyl ester, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, dimethyl fumarate is an ester with a double bond between the two central carbons. The groups on each end of the double bond are:

On the left: MeO2C-

On the right: CO2Me

Wait, but the double bond is between the two carbons. So, each carbon attached to the double bond has two substituents: MeO2C- on one end and CO2Me on the other, but arranged in a trans configuration. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \ /
     C=C
    / \
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, more accurately, the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, but the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are:

Left carbon: MeO2C- and two CH2 groups? No, wait, correct structure: the fumarate ester is formed from (E)-fumaric acid. So, the two methyl ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, fumarate is trans, so the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each carbon of the double bond has:

- One ester group (OCH3),
- One carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3),
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH in the cis form, but actually, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, in the dimethyl ester, it's MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. The double bond is between the two CH groups, and the ester groups are on either end.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   CH2
          ||
          C=C
          ||
          CH2
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The structure would be:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me?

No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

The double bond is between the two CH groups, and each CH is connected to a carbonyl (COOCH3) group on one side and a CH2 group on the other? No, wait, that's not correct. The correct structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me for the cis isomer (which would be maleate), but fumarate is the trans isomer.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two methyl ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the ester groups on opposite sides.

Now, what about stereoisomerism? Well, in fumarate, the double bond has substituents on each carbon. Each carbon has an ester group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3) on opposite sides.

Wait, but wait, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. Let's see: each carbon is connected to:

- One OCH3 group (from the ester),
- One carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3),
- And two H's. No, that can't be right because each double bond carbon would have two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each carbon is connected to:

- One OCH3 (from the ester),
- One O=C-OCH3,
- And two H's.

No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond has:

- One O=C-OCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- And two substituents which could be H's or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think about whether dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism. It does, but that's about cis and trans, which doesn't relate directly to optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, can a molecule with geometric isomerism also have optical isomerism?

No, only if it has a chiral center. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, let's check.

Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- One OCH3 group,
- One O=C-OCH3 group,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH=CH which is connected to another O=C-OCH3.

Wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me (but that's the cis isomer, which is maleate), while fumarate is the trans isomer, which is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, no, fumarate isn't MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. Let me get this right. The correct structure of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Its dimethyl ester is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- One MeO2C group,
- One CO2Me group,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, each of those carbons is connected to:

- One MeO2C group,
- One CO2Me group,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond is CH. So, each has one H, and the rest substituents.

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to:

- One MeO2C group,
- One CO2Me group,
- One H,
- And one double bond to the other CH.

In that case, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- H,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is to the other carbon, so it's part of the structure. So, the two substituents on each double bond carbon are MeO2C and CO2Me, and each has a H as well.

So, looking for chirality, each double bond carbon has substituents MeO2C, CO2Me, and H, plus the double bond. But a double bond restricts rotation, but that doesn't make the carbon a chiral center because the double bond doesn't allow for the necessary tetrahedral geometry. So, even though each carbon has three different substituents (MeO2C, CO2Me, H), the double bond means they don't have four different substituents. Thus, no chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism, but it does have geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.

Wait, but wait, what about if the molecule has a plane of symmetry? For example, in the trans isomer, the two substituents (MeO2C and CO2Me) are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For instance, in the trans configuration, the substituents on either end are mirror images, so the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, in summary:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes, after reevaluating, this has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone: no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: no.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought option 4 might have a possibility. Let me recheck. Oh, wait, no, I think I was mistaken. Dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, but in the molecule, the substituents on each double bond carbon are arranged symmetrically, so the molecule is achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another angle: maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me think. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration, the two OCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each end are mirror images, then it's symmetrical.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are same (both OCH3 groups), then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, among the options given, only option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the possible correct options are:

The question is which compounds show optical isomerism.

So, looking back:

Which of the four compounds have optical isomerism?

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only option 2 is correct. But wait, looking back at the options provided, the choices are:

Option A: 1,2,4 → no, because 1 and 4 don't.

Option B: 3 and4 → no.

Option C: 2 and3 → no, 3 doesn't.

Option D: 1 and2 → no, 1 doesn't.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and4

C) 2 and3

D) 1 and2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. So none of the options match that. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4. Let me reevaluate.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Structure: MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with trans configuration.

Now, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Each of the double bond carbons has:

- One MeO2C group,
- One CO2Me group,
- And two H's.

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond is CH, so each has one H and three substituents.

Wait, each double bond carbon has:

- MeO2C,
- CO2Me,
- H,
- and the double bond.

But the double bond is to the adjacent carbon, so each carbon is bonded to three groups and the double bond. So, for each, three substituents:

MeO2C, CO2Me, and H. So, each has three substituents plus the double bond.

So, no, each carbon is not a chiral center because it's not bonded to four different groups. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them say only 2. So, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again.

Another approach: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Fumarate has the trans configuration, while maleate is cis.

But does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? If the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (both OCH3), then yes, the molecule would be symmetrical, hence achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, what if the substituents are different? No, in this case, both ends are OCH3, so identical.

So, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option A has 1,2,4. Others don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Let me imagine the structure again. Two benzene rings connected by a single bond (1,1' position). Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2.

So, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The nitro is at 6, ester at 2.

Now, in biphenyl compounds, axial chirality can occur if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

If the two rings are identical in substituents, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents para to each other. So, each ring is symmetrical with respect to the central bond.

But does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the structure: both rings have the same substituents in the same positions. So, when you look at the molecule, flipping it over a plane would result in the same structure, meaning it's not chiral. So, no axial chirality. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, option 1 doesn't have it.

So, only option 2 is correct. But the options given don't have a choice with only 2.

Wait, looking back at the question, perhaps the options are different.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and4

C) 2 and3 

D) 1 and2 

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center somewhere else. But no, it's a symmetrical molecule.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when the ester groups are on opposite ends, the molecule is chiral. But no, because in the trans form, the substituents are symmetrically placed, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 2. Let me recheck.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Is the structure CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3?

If so, then the central carbon (the one with OH) has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, that's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So, option 2 is correct.

So, which options include 2? Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are incorrect.

Option D: 1 and2 → includes 2, but 1 is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, if the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but what if the molecule isn't symmetrical? Let me think again. If the substituents on each end are different, but in this case, they are the same (both ester groups). So, the molecule is symmetrical.

So, only option 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option that only includes 2. The closest is option A (1,2,4), but 1 and 4 don't have it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again about its structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: perhaps it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HOCH2-,
- CH2COOCH3,
- And two H's.

So, substituents are H, H, HOCH2-, and CH2COOCH3. So, two H's, so not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I was wrong about option 2.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to determine if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

Alternative approach: IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So, structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the one with OH) is CH2. Its substituents are:

- Two H's,
- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3.

So, substituents: two H's, CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. So, not all four different. Therefore, no chiral center.

Thus, option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center. But perhaps I was mistaken in that structure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct structure. Alternatively, I can think based on nomenclature.

The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon.

So, propanoate is:

COO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon, which is the middle CH2.

So, the structure would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe, so:

HO-CH2-CH2-COO-OMe.

Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, the esterification would form:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (the CH2 with OH) has two H's, so no chiral center.

Therefore, option 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, now, all four compounds don't have optical isomerism? That can't be right, because the question expects one of the options to be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons has different substituents, making them potential chiral centers if they were single bonds.

Wait, but in this case, it's a double bond, so they're sp² hybridized. So, even if the substituents are different, they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four substituents.

So, no optical isomerism.

So, if none of the options have optical isomerism, but the options must have at least one correct, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, dimethyl fumarate has E configuration. But does it have any chiral centers? No, because the substituents on each double bond carbon are MeO2C and CO2Me, each with a H. So, each has two identical substituents (since the other two are the double bond and a H), so no four different groups.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing it with another structure. Let me think about another scenario: if the substituents are different on each end, but in this case, they are the same.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option 1: biphenyl with substituents. If each ring has two substituents that are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers, no isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. No chiral centers, no isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have an option saying none. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and H.

In that case, four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, option 2 does have optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer would be option 2, but looking at the options, which include 2?

Looking at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → includes 2, but 1 is incorrect.

Hmm, but I thought option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let me think again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected at 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring is symmetrical, but the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, option 1 doesn't have it.

So, only option 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't include a choice with only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I thought 1 and 4 don't have it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4. Let me think again.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, what if the substituents on each double bond carbon are not the same? No, in this case, they are the same (each has a MeO2C and CO2Me group).

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are on the same side. No, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so they are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical.

So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have a correct choice with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me think about the other options again.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, perhaps it's a diastereomer, but that doesn't affect optical activity. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, a meso compound has multiple chiral centers but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. But in this case, there are no chiral centers, so it can't be a meso compound.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structures wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). But I thought 1 and 4 don't have it.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in option 4.

Wait, another angle: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a center of symmetry. If so, it's achiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, in conclusion:

Only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that only option 2 is correct, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the structural formula of each compound and their possible chiral centers.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: two benzene rings connected at 1 and 1'. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2.

Each ring is symmetrical, so the entire molecule is symmetrical. No chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3 → has a chiral center. So, yes.

3. benzophenone.

No chiral centers. So, no.

4. dimethyl fumarate.

No chiral centers. So, no.

Thus, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again.

Wait, if the structure were MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, that would be the cis isomer (maleate), which has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But the trans isomer (fumarate) is symmetrical as well, so again, no optical isomerism.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the options. Oh wait, perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and option 4 has a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another thought: fumarate is a trans double bond, but perhaps the molecule is also capable of existing in a cis form, but that's not what the question is about. The question is about whether the given compounds have optical isomerism, not geometric isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2. But none of the options include only 2, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 2. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is (CH3O)OCOCH2CH2OH.

Wait, that would be the structure if it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH2-OH

In this case, the central CH2 group is connected to:

- OCOOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- and two H's.

So, substituents on the central carbon are H, H, CH2OH, and OCOOCH3. So, two H's, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe the correct answer is none of the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 has a possibility.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. No, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical.

Thus, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on known facts.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, which is a meso compound. Wait, no, because meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't have chiral centers, so it can't be a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism, so the correct answer is none of the options, but that's impossible.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, so I'll have to go with my analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism that lead to optical activity.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1,1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The molecule is symmetrical due to identical substituents on both rings, and there is no axial chirality because the substituents do not create a lack of symmetry. Thus, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, leading to the presence of optical isomerism. Therefore, this compound **exhibits optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)COPh, where Ph represents a benzene ring. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two identical benzene rings. This makes the molecule symmetrical and achiral, with no chiral centers. Thus, benzophenone does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester of fumaric acid, with the structure MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. The double-bonded carbons are each bonded to identical groups (MeO2C and CO2Me), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes it achiral, and there are no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (option 2) exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided answer choices include only option 2. Based on the analysis, the closest match to the reasoning is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, even though options 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
