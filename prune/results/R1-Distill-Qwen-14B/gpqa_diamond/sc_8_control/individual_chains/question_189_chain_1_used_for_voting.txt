Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about particles associated with spontaneously broken symmetries and which one doesn't fit.

The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's in a particular state. Like how a pencil balanced on its tip has rotational symmetry, but once it falls, it breaks that symmetry.

Particles arising from such symmetry breaking are called Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry that's spontaneously broken, there's a massless boson. But wait, some of these might not be bosons. Let me think about each option.

Phonon (A): I'm pretty sure phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. They arise from the vibrational modes, and I think they're related to broken translational symmetry. Wait, no, actually, the phonon comes from the lattice vibrations when the crystal is in a solid state, which is a form of broken translational symmetry compared to a liquid. So phonons are Goldstone bosons for broken translational symmetry.

Skyrmion (B): Skyrmions are a type of topological soliton, right? They were proposed by physicist Tony Skyrma. Skyrmions are associated with the pion in the context of nuclear physics. I think they arise from the breaking of chiral symmetry in the strong interaction. So pions are Goldstone bosons, and Skyrmions are their topological configurations.

Magnon (C): Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in a magnetically ordered material. I remember that in ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism, the system has a broken symmetry because the spins align, breaking rotational symmetry. The magnon comes from spin waves, which are a result of the broken symmetry. So magnons are Goldstone bosons too, arising from the breaking of rotational symmetry in the magnetic order.

Pion (D): Pions are the lightest hadrons and are pseudoscalar mesons. They are the Goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the low-energy regime of QCD, and the pions (well, the light pions) are the massless bosons resulting from that. But wait, the pions are massive? Or wait, in reality, they have small masses because of explicit symmetry breaking due to the quark masses. But regardless, they are associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The question is asking which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So I need to find which one doesn't come from such a symmetry breaking.

Wait, the phonon comes from the breaking of translational symmetry. Wait, no, actually, phonons are a result of the lattice vibrations when the material is in a solid state. The translational symmetry is still there in the bulk, but the phonon is a low-energy excitation around a lattice vibration. Hmm, not sure. Wait, phonons are the quanta of the sound waves, which are collective excitations in a solid. The solid has a crystalline lattice, so the translational symmetry is broken in the sense that the solid's structure doesn't have the same symmetry as a liquid, but phonons are the low-energy excitations around the equilibrium positions. But wait, in a crystal, the translational symmetry is still present in the bulk, but with a periodic structure. So maybe the phonon doesn't directly come from a spontaneously broken symmetry in the same way as the others.

Wait, let's think. Goldstone's theorem applies to continuous symmetries that are spontaneously broken. Phonons are related to the breaking of translational symmetry, but that's a discrete symmetry (crystal structure) rather than a continuous one. Wait, no, translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry. But in a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken in the sense that the system isn't invariant under arbitrary translations anymore, only under a discrete set. So the spontaneous symmetry breaking here is the transition from a liquid (where all translations are allowed) to a solid with a periodic lattice. So in that case, the phonon would be the Goldstone boson for this broken symmetry. So A is associated with SSB.

Wait, but phonons are also considered as arising from the quantization of the crystal's vibrations, which are a result of the periodic lattice. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe phonons aren't the Goldstone bosons but are rather related to other types of symmetry breaking.

Wait, another angle: which of these particles isn't a Goldstone boson? Because the question is about not being associated with SSB. So if any of these is not a Goldstone boson, that's our answer.

Pions (D) are Goldstone bosons. Magnons (C) are Goldstone bosons for the broken magnetic symmetry. Skyrmions (B) are topological solutions, but the pions are the Goldstone bosons. So Skyrmions are more about the structure rather than the boson itself.

Wait, but the question is about particles that are effective, like quasi-particles. So if all options except one are Goldstone bosons, then the exception is the answer.

Phonon: Goldstone for translational symmetry breaking? Or perhaps no, because the translational symmetry is not broken in the same way. The phonon arises from the quantized vibrations, but I'm not so sure about whether it's a Goldstone boson.

Wait, in the case of a crystal, the translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry, but the ground state is periodic, so the system doesn't exhibit the full translational symmetry. So the phonon is the Goldstone boson for the broken translational symmetry. So all the options except one are Goldstone bosons, but which one isn't.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about each option.

A) Phonon: Goldstone boson for broken translational symmetry in solids.

B) Skyrmion: It's a solution in the presence of an approximate symmetry, like chiral symmetry in QCD. The Skyrmion model is an effective theory, and the pion is the Goldstone boson. But Skyrmion itself is a soliton, not a Goldstone boson. So maybe the Skyrmion is not the Goldstone particle but a composite.

C) Magnon: Goldstone boson for broken rotational symmetry in magnets.

D) Pion: Goldstone boson for chiral symmetry breaking.

So the question is: which is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. So, the Skyrmion is a solution due to the symmetry, but it's not the Goldstone boson itself. So the correct answer would be B) Skyrmion, because it's not a Goldstone boson but a topological solution. Or maybe the question is about which particle does not come from SSB.

Wait, but the question is which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. If all the others are, then the answer is the one that isn't. So phonon (A) is associated with SSB (broken translational symmetry). Magnon (C) with broken magnetic symmetry. Pion (D) with chiral symmetry. So the Skyrmion (B), is it a result of symmetry breaking? Or is the Skyrmion a model related to symmetry breaking.

Wait, the Skyrmion model is used to describe the pion as a Goldstone boson. So the Skyrmion itself isn't a Goldstone boson, but a model that has pions as their collective coordinates. So Skyrmions are not the Goldstone bosons; they're more like the configurations. So Skyrmions are not the particles resulting from SSB. So the answer is B) Skyrmion.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way: which of these is not a Goldstone boson. Pion is a Goldstone boson. Magnon is a Goldstone boson. Phonon is a Goldstone boson. Skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson but a soliton. So the correct answer would be B) Skyrmion.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

### A) Phonon  
Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice and arise from the vibrational modes of the lattice. In a solid, the translational symmetry is broken compared to a liquid, and phonons are considered the Goldstone bosons for this broken translational symmetry. Thus, phonons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

### B) Skyrmion  
Skyrmions are topological solitons proposed by Tony Skyrma and are associated with the chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, Skyrmions themselves are not Goldstone bosons; they are solutions in the effective theory where the pions (Goldstone bosons) appear as collective coordinates. Therefore, Skyrmions are not directly the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking but are instead related to the symmetry-breaking phenomenon.

### C) Magnon  
Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials. In systems like ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, the magnetic ordering breaks rotational symmetry, and magnons are the Goldstone bosons for this broken symmetry. Thus, magnons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

### D) Pion  
Pions are pseudoscalar mesons and the lightest hadrons. They are the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. Although their masses are slightly nonzero due to explicit symmetry breaking from quark masses, pions are directly associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Phonons, magnons, and pions are all Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken symmetries. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and not Goldstone bosons themselves. Therefore, the particle not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry is the **Skyrmion**.
