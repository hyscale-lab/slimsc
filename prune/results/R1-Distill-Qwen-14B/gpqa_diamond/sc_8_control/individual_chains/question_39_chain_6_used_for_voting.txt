Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function usually should have a modulus squared that integrates to 1, right? Because it's a probability amplitude.

Wait, but the wave function given seems a bit odd. Oh, wait, maybe it's a simplified form. The problem states that when they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given in a specific region, like between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because the problem says that when measuring, particles are only found between 1 and 3. So the wave function should be zero outside this interval. But the given expression is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Maybe that's the form in the region where the particle exists, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the expression is just an approximation in that region.

Wait, but the wave function given includes an imaginary part. Oh, right, wave functions can be complex. But when we compute probabilities, we take the modulus squared of the wave function.

So perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but that applies only within the region where the particle can be found, which is x between 1 and 3. Outside of that, it's zero. Wait, but the given expression doesn't include any terms that would make it zero outside. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again.

The question states: "the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So that part where it can exist is x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i in this region, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise. But wait, that would mean that the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So to find the value of 'a', I need to normalize the wave function so that the integral of |ψ|^2 from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is a complex number, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

Wait, let's compute ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Because (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and the imaginary part is squared, so it's positive.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the equation becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Therefore, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2):

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2? Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, and -0.5i is the imaginary part, so when you square the modulus, it's (real)^2 + (imaginary)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So |ψ|^2 is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Integrate from 1 to3, set equal to 1.

So the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5/0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, so approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.

To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and it is zero outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the modulus squared of the wave function over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} \, dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

   Thus, the first term becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
