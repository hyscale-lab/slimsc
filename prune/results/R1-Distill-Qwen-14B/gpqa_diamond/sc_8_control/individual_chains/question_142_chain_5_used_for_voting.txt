Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this represents a completely mixed state. Like, when a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's in the maximally uncertain state. So, it can't be distinguished from any other state because all the information is lost.

But how does this translate into geometric terms? I remember that the space of qubit states is represented by a Bloch sphere. Oh wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize all possible states of a qubit. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state, with the north pole being |0⟩ and the south pole being |1⟩. But wait, that's for pure states, right?

Density matrices come into play for mixed states. So, the density matrix for a completely mixed qubit is ρ_mixed = I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let me check: if I take the identity matrix (2x2), which is [[1,0],[0,1]], and divide by 2, I get [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So ρ is exactly that. So this must be a maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think that for the Bloch sphere, any pure state |θ, φ⟩ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector (x, y, z), where the vector has magnitude 1. The density matrix for a pure state is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

Wait, for a mixed state, the density matrix is a statistical mixture. For the maximally mixed state, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, that's equivalent to I/2. So how does that fit into the Bloch sphere representation?

The density matrix for a mixed state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with magnitude less than or equal to 1. For a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is I/2. So substituting that in, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies r·σ must be zero. So r must be zero, because any non-zero r would contribute. So the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0). That makes sense because a maximally mixed state has no coherence and is equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix for the completely mixed state is indeed (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which equals I/2. The Bloch vector is r = (x, y, z) such that the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. If I set ρ = I/2, then I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → I = I + r·σ → r·σ = 0. Which can only be true if r is zero. So yeah, the position is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents a maximally mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the space of qubit states is visualized, where pure states correspond to points on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states correspond to points inside the sphere. For a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is equivalent to the identity matrix divided by 2, i.e., \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\).

The Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), it follows that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), which implies \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the maximally mixed state is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided:

- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with specific coherences.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state at the north pole (\(|0\rangle\)).
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with specific coherences.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state is represented by the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
