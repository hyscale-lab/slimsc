Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reaction steps, and I need to find the right reagents A and B from the options provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and Reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually form cyanohydrins. So the first part is probably a cyanohydrin formation. The mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, and then the protonation. Oh wait, but the reagent here is NaCN. So NaCN is providing the cyanide ion. But what's Reagent A's role here?

In the formation of cyanohydrins, the mechanism typically goes like this: the ketone's carbonyl reacts with CN- to form a tetrahedral intermediate, which then gets protonated. So in the presence of an acid, perhaps. Wait, but sometimes the reaction can be done under acidic conditions. So Reagent A is probably an acid. Like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or maybe something else.

Looking at the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide added to the carbonyl, making a new carbon-carbon bond, and the hydroxyl group is added as well. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin. So for the first reaction, the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ because it's a proton source. But wait, I think sometimes other acids can be used too, but let's note that.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with Reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is getting converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical way is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat, or maybe using a strong oxidizing agent. Wait, another approach is the hydrolysis of nitriles under acidic conditions. So maybe Reagent B is something that helps in this hydrolysis.

Wait, the reaction is written as reacting with Reagent B (H2O). So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. The conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid are usually either under strong acidic conditions, often with heat, or using a strong base followed by acid work-up. Alternatively, using a reagent like HCl or H3O+ would be required.

Let me think. The starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed. The reaction conditions for this are typically either acidic or basic. In acidic conditions, you might use HCl, H2SO4, or another strong acid. In basic conditions, you might use something like aqueous NaOH, but then you'd need to acidify the solution afterward.

Looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the most likely reagents for the second step would be an acid, like HCl, providing the aqueous acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through each one:

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl. So first step uses acid, which makes sense for cyanohydrin. Second step uses HCl and water. That fits the idea of hydrolysis in acidic conditions. But wait, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires more than just HCl. Oh, but in the presence of water and acid, maybe it's a hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of HCl, it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH. So for the second step, acetic acid is used. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. Is that sufficient for hydrolysis of nitriles? I'm not too sure. I think nitrile hydrolysis typically needs stronger acids, like HCl, especially for the conversion to a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid might not be strong enough, but I'm not certain.

Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate. What does that do? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, sometimes in organic reactions, especially in the presence of CN groups, maybe sulfites are used. Oh wait, another thought: the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. In some cases, NaHSO3 is used as a mild acid or as a source of sulfite ions, which can act as a nucleophile. Wait, but in the first reaction, the cyanide is the nucleophile, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the role of A is to protonate the solution to make the reaction proceed.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. It's a source of H+ (since it's a diprotic acid, H2SO3, so NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- can donate a proton to become SO3^2- and H+). Hmm. So if A is NaHSO3, that would provide some H+ but not as strong as H3O+. Not sure if that's correct.

Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH. So for step one, maybe the reaction uses a sulfite. But I'm not sure about the first step with NaHSO3. Let me think again about the first reaction.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product is a cyanohydrin. To form cyanohydrin, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, and the acid helps protonate the intermediate to drive the reaction forward.

So Reagent A is likely an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+ or something else. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is more of a source of H+ and sulfite ion. Does it act as an acid here? Perhaps, but if the reaction requires H+ for the protonation, maybe H3O+ is a stronger acid, so option A uses that.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so either option A or B), and for the second reaction, B is HCl or something else.

Wait, the second reaction is with H2O as a reagent, but the reagent B is listed as H2O? No, actually, the way the question is worded: the second reaction is (Reagent B) and H2O. So the reagent B is used along with water. So the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Hmm, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis. The nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. So the conditions would be acidic or basic. Let's think about the reagents.

In the presence of H2O, the reaction is probably hydrolysis. For converting nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are:

a) Acidic hydrolysis: using HCl (like HCl and heat) followed by neutralization.

b) Basic hydrolysis: using NaOH (strong base), followed by acid work-up.

In the options, for Reagent B, some options use HCl (option A and C) and others use CH3COOH (options B and D).

So for the second reaction, if Reagent B is HCl, then the reaction is in aqueous HCl. That would provide the acidic conditions needed for hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, perhaps it's enough. But I'm not sure. I think for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, strong acid is necessary. So HCl (option A and C) would be more appropriate.

So looking back: first reaction requires an acid (so A must be H3O+ or NaHSO3, but which one? Wait, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+ because H3O+ is a strong acid (as it's the conjugate acid of water).

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a stronger acid than H3O+? No, wait: the pKa of H2SO3 is about 1.8 (first dissociation), and the second is around 7.2. So HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (pKa ~15.7 or so). So if you have NaHSO3, the solution would be acidic, but perhaps not as strong as H3O+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the acid is needed to protonate the intermediate in the cyanohydrin formation. So a strong acid might be better. So H3O+ (option A or B) would be more appropriate for the first step.

So in option A, A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That would mean:

1st step: butanone + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin. Makes sense.

2nd step: the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of HCl and water. So that would likely form the carboxylic acid. So option A is looking good.

But let's check the other options. Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. So for the second step, using acetic acid as the reagent. I'm not sure if that would be enough for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so maybe it's not strong enough. Hence, option B's B would not be suitable.

Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. But in that case, what's the first reaction? If A is NaHSO3, then the solution would be acidic. But I'm not sure if that is the right condition. I think H3O+ is more suitable for the first reaction.

So option A seems correct: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but wait another thing. The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So when the ketone reacts with CN-, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl is attacked by CN- to form an intermediate, which then is protonated. So in the presence of an acid, that would help in the protonation step. So H3O+ makes sense as the acid.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Then for the second reaction, B is HCl or CH3COOH.

But why would the second reaction need HCl? Because when you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually have strong acid conditions. For example, using HCl in water with heat. Alternatively, sometimes H2O and HCl are used as catalysts.

So in the second reaction, adding HCl and water would provide the acidic environment for hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So putting it together, option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That would make both reactions work.

I don't see any issues with that. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) for each step. 

### Reaction 1: Formation of Cyanohydrin
The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one with NaCN and Reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The reaction typically proceeds under acidic conditions, as the acid helps protonate the intermediate to drive the reaction forward. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary protons for the reaction.

### Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such reactions typically require acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, strong acids like HCl are commonly used to facilitate the reaction. Among the options, **HCl** is the most appropriate reagent for this step, as it provides the strong acidic environment needed for the conversion.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl):** Both reagents are suitable for their respective reactions. H₃O⁺ is ideal for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is appropriate for the nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH):** While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl):** NaHSO₃ is not a strong enough acid for the cyanohydrin formation, making it unsuitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH):** Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is not strong enough for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion
The most suitable reagents for the given reactions are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, as they provide the optimal conditions for both the cyanohydrin formation and the nitrile hydrolysis reactions.
