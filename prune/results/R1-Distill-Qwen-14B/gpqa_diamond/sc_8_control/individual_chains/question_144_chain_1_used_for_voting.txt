Okay, so I have this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think through it.

The question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh yeah, the natural linewidth is Γ, and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Or is it Γ = ħ / τ? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Oh wait, from the uncertainty principle, ΔE * Δt ~ ħ/2, so when we have Γ (which is like the uncertainty in energy), and a lifetime τ (which is the uncertainty in time), then Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, particles with a larger width Γ have a shorter lifetime, right? Because Γ is inversely proportional to τ. So if Γ is big, τ is small, so the particle doesn't live long. That aligns with what I remember about unstable particles.

So the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I also need to consider the speed of the particle. Because the decay distance is how far it travels before decaying, so it's v * τ. So the mean decay distance L is v * τ = v * (ħ / Γ). 

But wait, the particle's velocity v depends on its energy and mass. So how do I find v? Oh, I think I can use the relativistic relation. The energy E is given, which is the total energy. So E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The velocity v is related to γ by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). But maybe it's easier to express in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the velocity from the relation p = gamma m v, but maybe a better approach is to compute the velocity using v = (pc²)/E. Because, for a relativistic particle, E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Then, the velocity is v = (p c²) / E. 

Wait, let me think. The momentum p is given by p = gamma m v. So E = gamma m c². So v = (p c²) / E. Because, substituting gamma m v = p, then v = (p c²)/(gamma m c²) )? Hmm, maybe another approach. 

Alternatively, I remember that for a particle moving at speed v, the relation between energy and momentum is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ). So p = sqrt( E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c. 

So, then, v can be expressed as (p c^2) / E. Let me verify that. Because p = gamma m v. So, p c² = gamma m v c². And E = gamma m c². So, p c² = v E. So, v = (p c²) / E. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together, the decay length L is v * τ = v * (ħ / Γ). 

But wait, the units might get tricky here. Let me make sure I handle the units correctly. 

So first, let's compute the velocity v.

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. But wait, the GeV is a unit of energy, not mass. So I need to convert mass into kg. Because m = 1.2 GeV/c². Because E = mc², so m = E/(c²). So, 1 GeV is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg * c². Wait, let me think. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1.602e-10 J. E = mc², so m = E/(c²) = (1.602e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) ≈ 1.78e-27 kg.

So 1 GeV/c² is about 1.78e-27 kg. So m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so m_X = 1.2 * 1.78e-27 kg ≈ 2.14e-27 kg.

E is 8 GeV, which is 8 * 1.602e-10 J = 1.2816e-9 J.

So compute p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E is in J, m is in kg, c is m/s. Let's compute (m c²)^2: m c² is (2.14e-27 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 2.14e-27 * 9e16 = 1.926e-10 J. So (m c²)^2 is (1.926e-10)^2 = approx 3.71e-20 J².

E is 1.2816e-9 J. So E² is (1.2816e-9)^2 = approx 1.642e-18 J².

So E² - (m c²)^2 is 1.642e-18 - 3.71e-20 = approx 1.605e-18 J². So sqrt(1.605e-18) = approx 1.267e-9 J.

Then, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c = (1.267e-9 J)^(1/2) / (3e8 m/s) → wait, no, wait. Let me correct this. The expression is p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. So the sqrt gives the value in J·s/m, because p has units of kg·m/s.

Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically.

But perhaps a better approach is to use natural units. Wait, maybe I can compute v in terms of E and m without getting bogged down in the units. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation v = c * sqrt(1 - (m c^2)/E ). Hmm, that might be easier.

Wait, because E = gamma m c², and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Because E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV, so gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta (v/c) is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ) → because gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma^2 → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So let's compute beta.

gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Then, beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is roughly 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into units that match ħ's units.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me confirm: ħ = h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So, converting J to GeV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV → approximately 6.242e9 GeV. So ħ in GeV·s is (6.626e-34 J·s) * (6.242e9 GeV/J) ) / (2π) → let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps I can just look up the value of ħ in GeV·s. I think it's approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ → 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me double-check. Because Γ is the decay width, and the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. So yes, that's correct.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ.

v is 0.9887 c, so approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) → let's compute that.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8-24 = approximately 6.108 * 1e-16 → 6.108e-16 meters.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, etc.

Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let's go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let's recalculate beta.

gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So, gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/gamma squared is 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) → let's compute this more accurately. Let me think: sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(1 - 0.0225). Let me see, 0.988^2 = (1 - 0.012)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144= 0.976144. Hmm, but that's less than 0.9775. Wait, wait, no, 0.988 squared is 0.976144. So 0.988 squared is about 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is a bit higher than 0.988.

Let me compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887 → let's compute:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2

= (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2

= 0.9604 + 0.017188 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97766369.

Which is about 0.9777, which is just over 0.9775, so 0.9887 is a good approximation. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is about 0.9887 c.

So that part seems correct.

Now, back to τ. Let me recompute that.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let's compute that precisely.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

So v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying these together:

2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) = (6.108) * 1e-16 = 6.108e-16 meters.

But the options are all either about 4e-15 or 5e-15 or similar, which is an order of magnitude higher than my result. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity. Let me check the approach again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mean lifetime formula correctly. Let me think about natural units again. Because when dealing with particle physics, natural units (c=1, ħ=1) are often used. Maybe I should approach the problem using natural units.

So in natural units, c=1, ħ=1. So let's recompute everything in natural units, then convert the result to meters.

First, let's convert all energies to GeV.

E = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, Gamma_X = 0.32 GeV.

The width is Gamma_X=0.32 GeV.

In natural units, the lifetime tau is ħ / Gamma. But since ħ=1 in natural units, tau is 1 / Gamma. But we need to convert that into seconds.

Wait, no, in natural units, 1 GeV^{-1} is how many seconds? Because ħ c^5 is in units that let GeV^{-1} → meters.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the mean lifetime in natural units is tau = ħ / Gamma. But using GeV for Gamma, let's compute tau in seconds.

Alternatively, the formula for the decay length L is given by:

L = c * (ħ / Gamma) * beta gamma.

Wait, because in natural units, L = beta gamma * (ħ c / Gamma).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime τ multiplied by the velocity beta (v = beta c). So L = c * tau * beta.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma), so L = c * (ħ/(Gamma)) * beta.

But in natural units, ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So let me write L in terms of GeV and s.

So L = c * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV) ) * beta.

Because Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, compute this:

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s), then by beta (0.9887).

So L = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Wait, that's the same as before. So L ≈ 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 * 0.9887.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16. Multiply by 0.9887 gives about 6.10e-16 m. Which is what I had before.

But the options are all in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. So the results I'm getting are around 6e-16 m, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:
A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm. My calculation gives approximately 6e-16 m, which is not exactly any of the options. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recheck that.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma squared) = 1 - (1/(400/9)) → 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic gamma as E/(m c²) in natural units where c=1. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me compute it again.

L = v * tau = (0.9887 c) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV )

Wait, 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV → 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

So 0.9887 c * 2.056875e-24 s → 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiplied by 0.9887 gives 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.107e-16 m.

Hmm, same result as before. So that's about 6.1e-16 m. But the closest option is A) 5.02e-16 m, which is about 18% less than my value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for beta. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

0.9775 is 0.9775. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me think: 0.988^2 = 0.976144. 0.989^2 is (0.988 + 0.001)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.001 + 0.001^2 = 0.976144 + 0.001976 + 0.000001 = 0.978121.

Wait, our target is 0.9775.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144, 0.9885^2 → let me compute that.

0.9885 * 0.9885:

Compute (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 * 0.988 * 0.0005 + 0.0005^2 → 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.97713225.

Close to 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, as I had before, but let me see. 0.9885^2 is 0.977132, which is less than 0.9775. The difference is 0.9775 - 0.977132 = 0.000368.

How much more than 0.9885 do I need to get an additional 0.000368 in the square.

So, let x = 0.9885 + delta. x^2 ≈ 0.977132 + 2 * 0.9885 * delta.

Set 0.977132 + 2 * 0.9885 * delta = 0.9775 → 2 * 0.9885 * delta = 0.000368 → delta = 0.000368 / (2 * 0.9885) ≈ 0.000368 / 1.977 ≈ 0.000186.

So x ≈ 0.9885 + 0.000186 = 0.988686. So beta is about 0.988686, which is approximately 0.9887. So my earlier approximation was correct.

So that's not the issue. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong value for ħ. Let me double-check the value. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in putting the value of ħ. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So converting to GeV·s:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) ) → 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 = approx 6.586e-25 GeV·s.

Yes, so 6.582e-25 is a correct approximation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity differently. Let me try using the formula v = (pc²)/E.

Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ). So,

v = (pc²) / E → pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ), so v = (sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) * c² ) / E.

But in terms of units, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, in natural units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so perhaps it's easier.

Wait, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2). So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

And v = p / E → v = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) → which is the same as what I did earlier. So beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ), which is 0.9887, as before.

So I'm confident that beta is correct.

Hmm. Let me think about another approach. Maybe the decay length formula is L = c * tau * beta gamma. Wait, I thought it was v * tau, which is beta c * tau. So which is correct?

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Then, the distance is v * gamma tau. So L = v gamma tau.

Wait, yes, that's correct. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so tau_lab = gamma tau.

So, L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma tau.

But wait, earlier I used tau as the proper lifetime, so I need to multiply by gamma.

Wait, that's probably where I made the mistake. I forgot to include gamma in the calculation.

So let me recompute.

The proper lifetime (tau_0) is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

The lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_0.

But v is beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So putting it all together:

L = beta gamma c tau_0 = beta gamma c ( ħ / Gamma )

But since beta gamma is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) * (E/(m c^2)) ), but perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as (E)/(m c^2) ) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) → but wait, beta gamma = E/(m c^2) ) * beta.

Alternatively, since beta gamma = gamma beta = (E/(m c^2)) * (v/c) ) = (E/(m c^2)) * (sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E)^2 )) ) → but that's getting complicated.

But perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as gamma * beta, which is (E/(m c^2)) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E)^2 )

But let me compute beta gamma in this problem.

gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

beta is 0.9887.

So beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 ≈ 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.660.

So total is approximately 6.5922.

So beta gamma is about 6.592.

So, L = c * tau_0 * beta gamma.

tau_0 is ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s * 6.592 ≈ 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 * 6.592.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.592: 6.170625e-16 * 6.592 ≈ approximately 4.08e-15 meters.

Wait, that's about 4.08e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.

Hmm, so previously, I forgot to include the gamma factor and calculated L as v * tau_0, which was about 6.1e-16 m. But when including gamma, the L becomes about 4.08e-15 m, which matches option B.

So I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

So the correct formula should be L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So in summary:

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

beta gamma ≈ 6.592.

L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 6.592 ≈ 4.08e-15 m.

Which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = \hbar / \Gamma \) is the proper lifetime,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the energy of the particle,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.592
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \beta \gamma = 6.592 \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.592
\]

First, compute \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}
\]

Then, multiply by \( 6.592 \):

\[
L = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.592 \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
