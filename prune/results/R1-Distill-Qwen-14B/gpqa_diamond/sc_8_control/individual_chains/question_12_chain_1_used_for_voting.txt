Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, the question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the given reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are nearly massless, so I guess their rest mass is zero or negligible. So the muon's mass is 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's mass is approximately zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino after decay must cancel each other out. That means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. But since the neutrino's mass is zero, its momentum is just E/c, where E is its energy. The muon's momentum would be sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c. But maybe there's a simpler way to approach this without getting too deep into momentum.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So the sum of their energies must also be 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, right? So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic since it's massless. So E_nu = K_nu.

So the sum E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting, we get (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6.

But wait, because of conservation of momentum, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

For the muon, p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c. But since the neutrino is massless, p_nu = E_nu / c.

So setting them equal: sqrt(E_mu^2 - (105.7)^2 ) = E_nu.

But E_mu is (105.7 + K_mu), and E_nu is K_nu.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the masses and kinetic energies.

Let me try to write the equations.

Conservation of energy:
m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Conservation of momentum:
|p_mu| = |p_nu|

p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c
= sqrt( (m_mu c^2 + K_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c
= sqrt( (m_mu^2 c^4 + 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) - m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c
= sqrt( 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) / c

p_nu = E_nu / c = K_nu / c

Setting them equal:
sqrt( 2 m_mu c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) = K_nu

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Oh, right! In particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, you can use the formula for the kinetic energy in terms of the masses.

Wait, wait. The pion is at rest, so the muon and neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta, and their energies will be related.

I remember that the kinetic energy of each particle can be found using the formula:

K = ( (M^2 - m1^2 - m2^2) ) / (2 M) ) * c^2, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the invariant mass or use some energy-momentum relations.

Wait, but in this case, since the neutrino's mass is zero, some terms might simplify.

Let me try another approach. Let me denote the pion's mass as M, the muon's mass as m, and the neutrino's mass as 0.

So M = 139.6 MeV/c², m = 105.7 MeV/c².

The decay is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. So the total final momentum must be zero. So the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

The total energy is M c² = (m c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

So, M c² = m c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Also, because of momentum conservation, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|

p_mu is given by sqrt( E_mu^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

E_mu is m c² + K_mu.

p_nu is E_nu / c, since E_nu = K_nu.

So setting p_mu = p_nu:

sqrt( (m c² + K_mu)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c = K_nu / c.

Simplify the sqrt part:

sqrt( m² c^4 + 2 m c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 - m^2 c^4 ) = K_nu.

Which simplifies to sqrt( 2 m c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 ) = K_nu.

So,

K_nu = sqrt( 2 m c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 )

Hmm, and from the energy equation:

M c² = m c² + K_mu + K_nu.

We can substitute K_nu from the previous equation.

M c² - m c² = K_mu + sqrt( 2 m c^2 K_mu + K_mu^2 )

Let me denote x = K_mu. Then the equation becomes:

(M - m) c² = x + sqrt( 2 m c^2 x + x^2 )

Let me compute M - m. M is 139.6, m is 105.7. So M - m = 33.9 MeV.

So,

33.9 c² = x + sqrt( 2 * 105.7 c² x + x² )

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated to solve for x. Maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Let me write:

33.9 c² - x = sqrt( 2 * 105.7 c² x + x² )

Now, square both sides:

(33.9 c² - x)^2 = 2 * 105.7 c^2 x + x^2.

Expand the left side:

(33.9 c²)^2 - 2 * 33.9 c² x + x² = 2 * 105.7 c^2 x + x^2.

Subtract x² from both sides:

(33.9 c²)^2 - 2 * 33.9 c² x = 2 * 105.7 c^2 x.

Combine terms:

(33.9)^2 c^4 = (2 * 33.9 + 2 * 105.7) c^2 x.

Compute the coefficients:

33.9^2 = approx 1149.21.

The other side: 2*(33.9+105.7) = 2*(139.6) = 279.2.

So,

1149.21 c^4 = 279.2 c² x.

Divide both sides by c²:

1149.21 c² = 279.2 x.

So,

x = (1149.21 / 279.2 ) c².

Compute 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

1149.21 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 4.114.

So x ≈ 4.114 c^2 → but wait, x is in MeV because all terms are in MeV. Wait, c^2 is (MeV/c²) * c^2 → MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a unit mistake. Let me re-express the entire equation without units for simplicity.

Wait, M, m, and K are in MeV/c², but when multiplied by c², they become MeV.

Wait, perhaps all terms are in MeV, so let me just treat them as numbers.

So, M is 139.6, m is 105.7, M - m is 33.9.

The equation after substitution is:

33.9 = x + sqrt(2*105.7 x + x² )

From earlier steps, we found x ≈4.114.

Wait, but when I did the calculation, I think I might have confused the units. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, x is K_mu in MeV, right? Because it's the kinetic energy, which is energy, so in MeV.

So, in the equation:

33.9 = x + sqrt(2 * 105.7 * x + x² )

So with x ≈ 4.114, does that fit?

Let me plug x =4.114 into the right-hand side.

Compute 2*105.7 *4.114 = 211.4 *4.114 ≈ 870.8 MeV.

x² is (4.114)^2 ≈16.92 MeV².

So sqrt(870.8 + 16.92 ) = sqrt(887.72) ≈29.8 MeV.

So RHS is 4.114 +29.8 ≈33.914, which is close to 33.9. So that works.

So K_mu is approximately 4.114 MeV, and K_nu is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That looks correct.

Wait, but another option, option C is 3.52 and 20.8. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate the division. We had:

(33.9 c²)^2 = (33.9)^2 c^4 = (approx 1149.21) c^4.

The denominator was 279.2.

So x = 1149.21 / 279.2.

1149.21 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute that again.

279.2 * 4 = 1116.8.

1149.21 - 1116.8 =32.41.

So 4 + (32.41/279.2) ≈4 + 0.116 =4.116.

So x ≈4.116 MeV. So K_mu is around 4.12 MeV.

Then K_nu is sqrt( 2*105.7 *4.116 + (4.116)^2 ) → calculate 2*105.7=211.4.

211.4 *4.116 ≈ 211.4 *4=845.6, 211.4 *0.116≈24.5, total ≈870.1.

4.116^2 ≈16.94.

Sum is 870.1+16.94=887.04 → sqrt(887.04)≈29.78 MeV.

So K_nu is ~29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, that's option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Another sanity check: the sum of the kinetic energies should be 139.6 - (105.7 + 0) =33.9 MeV. Let's see, 4.12 +29.8=33.92 MeV, which is correct.

So the answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), while the neutrino's mass is effectively zero.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = (m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}) + K_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting \(m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we get:
\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
The pion is initially at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. This means the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
\]
For the muon, the momentum is given by:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(E_{\mu^+})^2 - (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}/c,
\]
where \(E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}\). For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
p_{\nu} = E_{\nu}/c = K_{\nu}/c.
\]
Equating the momenta:
\[
\sqrt{(m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+})^2 - (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} = K_{\nu}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\sqrt{2 m_{\mu^+} c^2 K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2} = K_{\nu}.
\]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu^+}\) and \(K_{\nu}\)
Let \(x = K_{\mu^+}\). Substituting into the above equation:
\[
K_{\nu} = \sqrt{2 m_{\mu^+} c^2 x + x^2}.
\]
From the energy equation:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu} = 33.9,
\]
we substitute \(K_{\nu}\):
\[
x + \sqrt{2 m_{\mu^+} c^2 x + x^2} = 33.9.
\]
Squaring both sides and simplifying:
\[
(33.9)^2 = x^2 + 2 m_{\mu^+} c^2 x.
\]
Expanding and solving for \(x\), we find:
\[
x \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Substituting \(x\) back into the momentum equation:
\[
K_{\nu} = \sqrt{2 m_{\mu^+} c^2 x + x^2}.
\]
After calculation:
\[
K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
