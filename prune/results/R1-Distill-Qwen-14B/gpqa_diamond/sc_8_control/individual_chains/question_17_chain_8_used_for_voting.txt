Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out which one's correct.

Wait, the problem mentions that the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or protonation. Oh right, because EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds metal ions, forming complexes. So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY^2- or something like that.

The formula I think I need is the one for the dissociation of the complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells me how much the complex dissociates. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, so Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). But wait, sometimes the K given is the dissociation constant, which would be the inverse. Hmm, the question states KCa-EDTA is 5x10^10. I think in this context, it's the formation constant, so Kf = 5e10.

Wait no, sometimes K is given as the dissociation constant, Kd = 1/Kf. So if KCa-EDTA is 5e10, then Kd would be 1/(5e10). Wait no, I think the question is giving Kf as 5e10, because formation constants are typically large. So Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the equilibrium is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, which is the [CaEDTA^2-] term. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, and the complex doesn't dissociate much, but given that Kf is large, the complex is very stable, so [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] would be very small.

But wait, the problem is about finding [Ca^2+], right? So from the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is either in the form of Y^4- (the deprotonated form) or as H4Y or other protonated forms. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So [EDTA^4-] is the same as the free EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA is usually present as H4Y, which is a polyprotic acid. But since the pH is ideal, maybe the problem is assuming that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [Y^4-] is just the free EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in the solution, the total EDTA comes from two sources: the free EDTA and the EDTA that's bound in the complex. So the total EDTA (both free and bound) is the sum of [Y^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-]. But given that Kf is very large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal, so [Y^4-] would be very small. Therefore, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Y^4-] is negligible compared to that. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

The total concentration of EDTA species would be [Y^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = Ct, the total EDTA. But if the complex is mostly undissociated, which it should be because Kf is so large, then [Y^4-] would be much smaller than [CaEDTA^2-]. So for the sake of approximation, [Y^4-] ≈ [Ca^2+], but I'm not sure. Wait, that's maybe not right. Let me think.

Wait, the reaction is Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-.

At equilibrium, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x, and free Y^4- as y.

So the Kf expression is:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/(x * y) = 5e10.

But the total EDTA is the sum of [CaY^2-] and [Y^4-], but wait, no. Because the EDTA is either in the complex or free. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M, because each complex has one EDTA. So the initial EDTA would be 0.02 M, but some may dissociate into Y^4-.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt. So if the salt is, say, Ca(EDTA)·nH2O, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So the sum [CaY^2-] + [Y^4-] = 0.02 M. But [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M (since it's given) and [Y^4-] is negligible, but wait that can't be possible because 0.02 + something small equals 0.02. So maybe [Y^4-] is x, and [CaY^2-] is 0.02 - x. But if Kf is very large, x is very small, so [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02, and [Y^4-] ≈ x.

Wait, but the solution is the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial EDTA is 0.02 M, all in the form of the complex. So the free EDTA (Y^4-) is x, and the complex is 0.02 M. So, [Y^4-] = x.

Then, the Kf equation is:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

Because [Ca^2+] is x, since each dissociation releases one Ca^2+ and one Y^4-.

So 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Then, solving for x^2: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 =4e-14.

Wait, no:

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at an ideal pH and 25 °C, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Equilibrium Expression**:  
   The formation constant is given by:
   \[
   K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]
   Here, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) (since the dissociation releases equal amounts of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)).

2. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   Substituting into the equilibrium expression:
   \[
   K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x^2\)**:  
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]

4. **Find \(x\)**:  
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.

### Final Answer:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is **\(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
