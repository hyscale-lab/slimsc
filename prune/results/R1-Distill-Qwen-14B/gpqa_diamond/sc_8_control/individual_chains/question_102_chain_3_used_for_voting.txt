Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically dealing with transgenic constructs and expression. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're trying to study their developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic vectors have two open reading frames (ORFs) in one construct, usually under a single promoter but separated by an IRES element so that both can be expressed.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' end and is fused to mCherry. Wait, wait, no, wait. The question says the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Oh wait, no, let me read that again. The ligand ORF is at 5', and mCherry is after a stop with a loxP cassette. Oh wait, no. So between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed, then a stop, then mCherry? Or is that it's a separate construct?

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the ligand is first, then an IRES, then the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the IRES, which allows it to be expressed without the need for a separate promoter but depends on the ribosome's scanning.

So the structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop with loxP -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop with lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no, the question says the ligand is under CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the construct is probably CBA promoter driving the ligand, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop), then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So when the vector is transfected into cells, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor would be expressed as separate proteins, because the stop cassettes prevent the ORFs from being read through. But when Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, allowing the ORFs to be in frame. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, the loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272 are stop cassettes. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the mCherry is not expressed because the stop is in place. Similarly, the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning it has two ORFs. The first ORF is the ligand, which is fused to mCherry. Wait, no, the ligand ORF is at 5', and mCherry is after a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed as a separate protein, and mCherry is under the control of the loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be in the same reading frame, producing a fusion protein? Or perhaps the stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript as the ligand.

Wait, maybe I should visualize the construct:

[ Promoter (CBA) ] --> [ Ligand ORF ] --> [ loxP Stop loxP ] --> [ IRES ] --> [ Receptor ORF ] --> [ lox2272 Stop lox2272 ] --> [ eGFP ]

So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a separate protein, and the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being expressed. The receptor is also expressed, but the stop cassette prevents eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is introduced, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry as a fusion, and the receptor along with eGFP as a fusion. Or, because Cre is used, perhaps it's for tissue-specific expression, like using a Cre line to activate the expression of both ligand and receptor in specific cells.

Wait, the setup says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest derivatives, like in the skin, maybe Schwann cells, and other neural crest cell lineages.

So when the Cre is introduced, it would recombine the loxP sites in the construct, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed.

Wait, but the question says that after the offspring is born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal. They don't see any green. So the eGFP is not being expressed.

But according to the vector setup, the eGFP should be expressed when Cre is present, because the stop cassette before eGFP would be removed.

So why isn't eGFP being expressed? The possible answers are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, let's think.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but if the cells are expressing both, maybe they signal each other. Not sure how this affects the expression in the Western blot or the fluorescence. But the question is about why eGFP isn't showing up. So maybe not A.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. So the construct is made but not secreted or not on the surface. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, perhaps it's properly trafficked. But eGFP is a reporter, so if the construct is properly processed, eGFP should be expressed. If it's stuck in the Golgi, would eGFP not be expressed, but perhaps the receptor is? Not sure. But the Western blot result is that the proteins are expressed proportionally to actin. Wait, the question says that the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin loading. So probably, the proteins are being expressed, but when using the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in the Western blot. Wait, but the Western blot is done on the transfected primary astrocyte culture. So in the culture, they transfected the plasmid, and then used antibodies to check expression.

Wait, the part about the mouse model: the mice are homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, leading to the recombination of the lox sites in the construct, activating the expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But when they look for green signal in the offspring, they don't see any. So the eGFP isn't being expressed in the tissues where SOX10-Cre is active.

Why would eGFP not be expressed? Let's think about the vector.

The vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place. When Cre is present, the lox2272 stops are recombined, allowing the eGFP to be expressed along with the receptor.

But perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, or the construct wasn't properly integrated.

Looking at the options, option D is the receptor and eGFP not in the same frame. If the stop cassette wasn't removed, the ORF would be interrupted. But if the lox2272 is correctly recombined, the stop is removed, and the eGFP should be in frame. If the frames don't match, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But the question says that the stop is in the lox2272 cassette; perhaps, when Cre is used, the lox2272 sites are recombined, so the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed in frame.

Wait, but the lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but I think it's used for different recombination events. So perhaps the construct is set up so that in the presence of Cre, the stop between receptor and eGFP is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed after receptor.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being translated because of the stop codon. But if the Cre-recombination removes the stop, then it's expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because of the way the vector is set up. But in the question, the researcher used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in the Western blot. So perhaps in the transfected astrocytes, both ligand and receptor are expressed, but when the mouse is made, the SOX10-Cre isn't activating the construct correctly.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the Cre isn't being expressed properly, or the recombination isn't happening. But the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should provide Cre in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the construct should be activated.

But perhaps the issue is in the expression in the mouse. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, but IRES allows the second ORF to be expressed in the same mRNA.

Another possibility is that the promoter for the receptor is not strong enough, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. But the IRES-driven receptor may not be expressed as well.

Wait, the question says that after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they use the antibodies on the Western blot. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but when the mouse is made, the construct isn't expressed because of the way the plasmid was integrated?

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed. So let's look at the options again.

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so I don't think that's the issue. The receptor is under the IRES, which is dependent on the first promoter. So if the promoter is missing, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but the ligand would. But in this case, neither is expressed, perhaps?

Wait, but the question says that in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't observed. So the issue is probably in the way the construct is designed. 

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed via Cre, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. That could prevent eGFP from being made, which would explain the lack of green signal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed so that the loxP and lox2272 sites are different, and only one of them is recombined, leaving the stop cassette intact. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF is expressed as a separate protein. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the IRES. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. So with Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP fusion.

But if the vector isn't correctly recombined, the stop cassettes remain, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem could be that the stop cassette isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Why wouldn't the stop cassette be removed? Perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells, but the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, so Cre can't recombine them.

Wait, the ligand has a loxP stop, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop. Are these compatible with the same Cre? I think lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but I'm not sure if they can be used interchangeably. Oh wait, loxP and lox2272 are different; they have different sequences and require specific Cre variants. So perhaps the construct uses loxP and lox2272, and the Cre used is wild-type, which can only recombine loxP sites.

Wait, no, I think wild-type Cre can recombine both loxP and lox2272, but maybe not. Because lox2272 is a mutant site that requires Cre with a certain mutation to recombine. Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. 

So, loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a mutant version that requires Cre to have a specific mutation (like the Dre site) to recombine. Or wait, lox2272 is a loxP variant that can be recombined by Cre but has different recombination efficiency. Alternatively, maybe lox2272 is a pseudo site that doesn't recombine with wild-type Cre.

Wait, no, I think that lox2272 is a loxP variant that can be recombined by wild-type Cre, but the recombination is directional. So perhaps the construct has loxP and lox2272 sites, and only when Cre is present to recombine both, the stops would be removed.

But in the given scenario, the Cre used is from SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. So if the lox sites are loxP and lox2272, and the Cre can't recombine both, then the stop cassettes wouldn't be removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, if the ligand ORF is flanked by loxP sites and the receptor by lox2272, then using wild-type Cre would only recombine the loxP sites, not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop would remain, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But in the case of the mouse, the ligand and receptor are controlled by different stop cassettes. So if only the loxP site is recombined, ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but receptor-eGFP wouldn't. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Ah, that's a possibility. So if the vector uses different lox sites (loxP for ligand and lox2272 for receptor), and the Cre used can't recombine both, then only the ligand's stop is removed, not the receptor's. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Which would mean that the problem is that the receptor's stop isn't removed because the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 site. So the eGFP isn't made, which is why no green signal is observed.

But looking at the options, which option would this correspond to?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent eGFP expression. But in this case, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but that's due to the stop, not the frame.

Wait, but the question says that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in the way. But if the stop is removed, then the eGFP should be expressed in frame.

So if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present. So why isn't the stop removed? Because Cre can't recombine the lox2272 site.

But the question says that the vector uses loxP-stop for ligand and lox2272-stop for receptor. The Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. So if wild-type Cre can't recombine lox2272, the stop would remain.

But wait, I'm not sure if wild-type Cre can recombine lox2272. Maybe lox2272 requires a different Cre, like Dre or another variant.

If that's the case, then the Cre in the mice (wild-type) can't recombine the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly address the issue of the lox sites not recombining. The options given are A to D.

Looking again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. If the stop is not removed, perhaps the frame is wrong. But that's a separate issue.

Alternatively, if the stop is removed correctly, but the reading frame is wrong, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the design would have them in frame.

Wait, but the question says the vector has the stop between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed. If the ORFs are in the same frame, then it would be expressed.

But if the frames are different, then eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no signal. So option D would explain this.

So why would the frames be different? Because when the stop is removed, the reading frame of the receptor and eGFP might not align, making the eGFP not expressed. But I think the design of the vector would ensure that they are in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, so when Cre recombines, the reading frame shifts. But if the construct is designed correctly, this shouldn't be the case.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the vector uses the same stop cassette for both, but they used different lox sites. If the Cre can't recombine both, then only the ligand's stop is removed, leaving the receptor's stop intact. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't mention lox sites. So perhaps the issue is with the IRES element.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed at all. But that would affect the ligand as well, which is under CBA.

Wait, the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, so they could check if the ligand and receptor are expressed. The fact that the signal is proportional to actin loading suggests that the proteins are expressed. So in the transfected cells, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but when the construct is in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't activating the right parts.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is being expressed but not detected because of some technical issue. But the question says that the green signal isn't observed under the confocal, so it's likely that the eGFP isn't expressed.

Putting it all together, the most likely reason for no green signal is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't recombined, perhaps due to the lox sites not being compatible with the Cre used.

But given the options, the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Alternatively, option C says the enhancer is missing, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so that's probably not the issue.

Wait, another thought. The vector has the ligand under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the CBA promoter drives the transcription, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein in the same mRNA. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry (after stop is removed), and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But in the Western blot, the transfected astrocytes express the proteins, so the IRES must be working.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the stop cassettes are not correctly placed. For instance, the lox2272 in the receptor's stop cassette might not be correctly recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't removed, preventing eGFP from being expressed. If the lox2272 isn't recognized, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But without knowing the exact details of Cre and lox2272 compatibility, it's hard to say.

But none of the options directly address this. So looking back at the options, let's think about each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. That means they act on different cells. But the question is about expression. Maybe if they're paracrine, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cell as the receptor. But I'm not sure.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it's correctly trafficked. But if eGFP is cytoplasmic, perhaps it's not expressed. But the question states that the eGFP is fused to the receptor's C-terminus, so if the receptor is properly processed, eGFP should be expressed as well.

Option C: Enhancer missing for ligand and receptor. But ligand is under CBA, so maybe the receptor requires an enhancer. But the IRES should drive expression without an enhancer.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed, then if they're in frame, it should be expressed. So if they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed.

So which is more likely? If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is removed but the frames are wrong, eGFP isn't expressed either.

In the given setup, if the Cre can't remove the stop (because the lox sites are incompatible), then the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't removed because the vector wasn't correctly recombined, which would prevent eGFP from being expressed. But the option that aligns with this is D, if the frames are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed so that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. When Cre removes the stop, the eGFP is in frame, but if the vector had an incorrect reading frame, it wouldn't.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach is to think about how the expression works.

If the construct is correctly recombined, then the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as a fusion. If the frames are wrong, the eGFP won't be expressed.

Alternatively, if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre. If the lox sites are compatible, the stops are removed.

Given that the green signal isn't observed, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the frames are not aligned, meaning D is the correct option.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: the IRES is for the receptor, so the C-terminal part of the receptor is followed by eGFP. If the stop is correctly removed, then the eGFP should be expressed. But if the reading frame isn't correct, the eGFP won't be expressed.

So the issue is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame. So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, separated by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice to activate Cre-mediated recombination. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy in the offspring. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this observation.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of eGFP, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. Paracrine signaling does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be transcribed and translated but improperly trafficked. However, the Western blot result indicates that the proteins are expressed proportionally to actin loading, suggesting that the construct is being transcribed and translated. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to prevent its expression. The receptor is driven by an IRES, which does not require an enhancer. The Western blot result also confirms that both the ligand and receptor are expressed in transfected astrocytes, making this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   For eGFP to be expressed, the stop cassette must be removed via Cre-mediated recombination, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed in the same reading frame. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, eGFP would not be expressed. This is a plausible explanation for the lack of green signal, as frame misalignment would prevent proper eGFP expression.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation that no green signal is detected under confocal microscopy.

**Answer: D**
