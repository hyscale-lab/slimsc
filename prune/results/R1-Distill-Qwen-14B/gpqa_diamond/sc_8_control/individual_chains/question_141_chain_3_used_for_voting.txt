Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A through D.

Wait, wait. First, I need to make sure I understand what the starting material is. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, benzene with substituents? Wait, maybe it's benzene with a bromine at position 1 and something else at position 2? Oh, but the "-d" part is a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think that's a typo or shorthand. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium (d) substitution. Or, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? No, not sure. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2.

Okay, moving on. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, right? Common reactions with such conditions include elimination reactions, dehydrohalogenation, or perhaps dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But since the starting material is a benzene ring, I'm thinking about aromatic substitution reactions.

Wait, no, if it's benzene with substituents, maybe it's undergoing a ring substitution. But wait, bromine is a meta-directing group. But wait, the solvent is ammonia, which is aprotic. Hmm. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in elimination or dehydrohalogenation, but in aromatic substitution, maybe it's used for dehydrobromination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond, making a benzene ring with a substituent that's deprotonated.

Wait, wait, another thought: when an aromatic compound has a halide, like bromobenzene, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, especially in a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps it's a case of aromatic nucleophilic substitution. But aromatic nucleophilic substitution usually requires strong activating groups, like electron-donating groups, which are present in the ring to activate it towards nucleophilic attack. Bromine is a deactivating group, so nucleophilic substitution on bromobenzene is unlikely. Or perhaps under these conditions, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: elimination. If the compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, then perhaps in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, the deutero proton might be abstracted, leading to elimination of H2O or something? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the deuterium.

Wait, but benzene is already a ring with all sp2 hybridized carbons, so any elimination would have to form a new double bond, but it's already a ring. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, right? Because in benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho). So, the structure is Br at position 1, and a D (deuterium) at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton or the deuterium. Wait, deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, but in terms of basicity, it's similar, but perhaps reactions involving deuterium are slower because of the mass difference. So, maybe the base abstracts a deuterium from position 2.

If the base abstracts the deuterium, that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 2. But wait, benzene is aromatic, so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a dehydrohalogenation mechanism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a triple bond, but that doesn't make much sense with benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base is causing the bromide ion to leave, but that would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. So, perhaps a substitution occurs where the bromide leaves, and the base takes a proton from somewhere else. Wait, but in aromatic substitution, the leaving group would have to be in a position that allows for a transition state where the ring remains aromatic. For example, in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards such a substitution, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Since bromine is a deactivating group (EWG), perhaps it's possible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, but I'm not sure how that would work on a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps the compound isn't benzene but a naphthalene system? No, the question says benzene.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, but something else. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Wait, the 'd' could be a typo for 'NMe2' or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, with Br and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamine? No, maybe 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So I'll stick with that structure.

Now, the reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia. Maybe it's a case of a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has all double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction? No, Birch reduction is with sodium and ammonia in ethanol, I think, and it's a reduction of aromatic rings to cyclohexadienes. But that would be a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the NaNH2 is causing the elimination of HBr. So in the starting material, Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2. If the base abstracts a beta proton, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene already has all sp2 carbons, so forming a new double bond would imply breaking an existing one. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is at position 2, and the base abstracts the deuterium, leading to a benzene ring with a bromine and a negative charge. That's not stable, so perhaps the bromide leaves, and a benzene ring with a negative charge would form a more stable structure through conjugation. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as a Ullmann coupling, but that usually requires a copper catalyst and typically occurs under different conditions. Plus, I don't see any coupling partners here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's unlikely because it's not a typical outcome.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the starting material isn't a benzene ring but a substituted toluene or something else. Wait, no, the question clearly says benzene.

Another approach: think about the possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the number of possible products depends on the number of possible positions where substitution can occur.

Wait, but in the case of elimination, perhaps more than one product is possible. Or maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to different isomers.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. But in benzene, all positions are adjacent in a way, but the structure is a ring, so elimination would form a new double bond, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a meta-directing substitution where the base attacks, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible elimination products. Let's imagine that NaNH2 abstracts a proton that's beta to the Br. So, in the structure, Br is at position 1, and the adjacent position is 2. So, the base could abstract a proton from position 2 or position 6 (if the Br is at 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6). Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has a deuterium. So, if the base abstracts that deuterium, perhaps leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require the loss of Br- as a leaving group, but in that scenario, the base would deprotonate, and the Br would leave, forming a double bond.

So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's just part of the aromatic ring. So, perhaps that's not possible because benzene is already conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes non-aromatic, but that's not likely under these conditions.

Wait, maybe the reaction is forming a diradical or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a strong base, and in ammonia, perhaps it's generating NH2- as a nucleophile. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the NH2- attacks the ring in a position activated towards such attack.

But wait, Br is a deactivating group, so the ring isn't very activated. Unless there's another substituent. Oh, wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, which I thought was Br at 1 and D at 2. So, the ring has two substituents: Br and D. Wait, but D is just a hydrogen isotope, so perhaps it's a substituent that's just a single H replaced by D. So, the ring has Br and H (or D) at adjacent positions.

Wait, but in that case, the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2. So, the structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Now, when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton from the ring. Where could that proton be? The most acidic protons in a benzene ring are usually those ortho and para to electron-withdrawing groups. So, Br is a meta director, and the ring's acidity would be higher at the ortho and para positions relative to Br.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions (ortho) are 2 and 6. Position 2 already has a D, but perhaps the base could abstract a proton from position 6.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is meta to Br, but wait, Br is at position 1, so position 2 is ortho, 3 is meta, 4 is para, etc. So, position 6 is ortho to Br. So, the H in position 6 is acidic because it's ortho to the Br, which is deactivating and can stabilize the negative charge upon deprotonation.

So, when the base (NH2-) abstracts a proton from position 6, the ring would have a negative charge at position 6. But how does that proceed? In aromatic systems, deprotonation can lead to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which is resonance-stabilized.

After deprotonation, the ring would have a negative charge at position 6. Then, what would happen? The Br is a leaving group, perhaps. But wait, in an aromatic substitution, the leaving group would need to depart, but in this case, Br is at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2 (D) and position 6 (where deprotonation occurred).

Wait, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, and the negative charge moves around the ring. But that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ring undergoes some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to a diradical or some other structure that can eliminate Br. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a deuterium, but since D is less acidic than H, maybe it's not as likely. But if the base is strong enough, it could abstract the D. But then, what's the product of that?

If the base abstracts the D from position 2, the ring would have a negative charge at position 2. Then, perhaps the Br could leave as Br-, but that would require a good leaving group, which Br is. So, the ring would lose Br- and D-? That doesn't make sense because D is a proton substitute, not a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after deprotonation at position 6, the Br leaves, and the ring forms a new double bond. So, the ring would lose Br- and have a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene already has a conjugated ring, so forming a new double bond would imply breaking the existing ones, which isn't feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure without more information.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but in benzene, that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, let me think about the possibility of substitution. If NH2- is a nucleophile, and the ring is activated towards substitution, maybe it attacks the ring. But with Br being a meta director, the nucleophile would attack at the meta position relative to Br. But wait, in this case, the ring already has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the meta position to Br would be position 4. So, perhaps the NH2- could substitute at position 4.

But wait, to attack position 4, the ring would need to be activated towards nucleophilic substitution. Br is a deactivating group, which makes the ring less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. However, if there's another substituent that activates the ring, perhaps that could help. But in this case, the only substituents are Br at 1 and D at 2. The D is just a hydrogen isotope, so it's an activating group? No, because D is similar to H, which is an activating group. But wait, in this case, the ring has Br and D as substituents. So, perhaps the ring is being activated at positions adjacent to D.

Wait, D is like H, so it's an activating group, ortho/para director. So, the positions ortho and para to D would be more activated. So, the ring has D at position 2, so positions 1 (already occupied by Br), 3 (meta), and position 6 (ortho) would be ortho to D. Position 4 and 6 would be para to D.

Wait, but position 6 is already ortho to Br, which is a deactivating group. So, perhaps the ring is activated at position 4 (para to D) and position 3 (meta to Br and adjacent to D? Not sure). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type, but since Br is a deactivating group, that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to the formation of multiple isomers, say, due to different positions of substitution, then the number of products would be higher.

Wait, another approach: maybe the starting material is undergoing a ring expansion or some sort of coupling to form a new ring structure. But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, let's think about dehydrohalogenation again. If the Br is removed and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, but that's part of the benzene ring. That might not be possible because benzene is already a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a triple bond, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where Br is replaced by an amine group. So, NaNH2 in ammonia could provide NH2- as a nucleophile. If it substitutes Br, the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But would that be possible? I think aromatic nucleophilic substitution with NH2- is possible under certain conditions, especially with strongly activated rings. But in this case, the ring has Br and D substituents, which aren't strong activators.

Wait, but if the ring is activated at position 4 (para to D), perhaps the nucleophile could attack there. Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at position 3 or 5, depending on the substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible positions the substitution could occur. If the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2, the possible positions for substitution by NH2- would be influenced by both substituents.

Br is a meta director, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5 (assuming numbering starts at Br as 1). D, being like H, is an activating group and an ortho/para director. So, D at 2 would direct incoming groups to positions 1 (already Br), 3 (meta to D), and 6 (ortho to D). Wait, but position 1 is already occupied. So, possible positions are 3 and 6.

But wait, the presence of Br at 1, which is deactivating, might also influence where the substitution occurs. So, the overall effect would be a competition between the directing effects of Br and D.

Wait, perhaps the Br directs the substitution to positions 3 and 5 (meta to Br), and the D directs substitution to positions 3, 6 (ortho to D), and 4 (para to D). So, the possible positions for substitution are 3,4,5,6.

But if both substituents are present, their combined directing effects could lead to substitution at certain positions. For example, position 3 is meta to Br and ortho to D, so perhaps it's a possible site. Position 4 is para to D and meta to Br (since Br is at 1, position 4 is meta to Br? Let me think: positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, position 4 is across from position 1 (Br), so it's para to Br. But Br is a meta director, so para to Br would be position 4. Hmm, but wait, the meta positions to Br at 1 would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, no. Let me correct that: for a substituent at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Para is position 4.

So, Br at 1 would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5 (meta) and position 4 (para). But wait, aromatic substituents usually direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions based on their nature.

Wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director. So, it would activate positions 3 and 5 (meta to Br) for electrophilic substitution, but in this case, we're dealing with nucleophilic substitution, which is less common and requires a strongly activated ring.

D is like H, which is an activating group, so it's an ortho/para director. So, D at 2 would direct substitution to positions 1 (ortho), 3 (meta to D would be position 5, but not sure), and 6 (ortho), and position 4 (para to D).

Putting it all together, the possible positions for substitution by NH2- could be influenced by both Br and D. But since Br is deactivating, it's not clear if substitution can occur at all. Alternatively, perhaps only certain positions are activated enough for the substitution to happen.

Alternatively, if the reaction is elimination, perhaps the product is a ring with a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the Br. But that seems impossible because benzene already has all double bonds conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a missing Br and a new substituent from the base. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But would that be possible under these conditions?

But the solvent is condensed ammonia, so maybe it's a good environment for such a substitution. But as I thought earlier, Br is a poor leaving group for nucleophilic aromatic substitution unless the ring is highly activated.

Wait, but if the ring is activated by another substituent, like the D at position 2, which is an ortho/para director, maybe the substitution can occur at position 4 (para to D) or position 3 (ortho to D). Hmm, but Br is at position 1, which is a meta director, so perhaps the substitution can occur at position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br. But I'm not sure how the two substituents interact.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one substitution product. For example, substitution at position 3 and position 4, leading to two different products. Or maybe three positions are possible, leading to three products.

Alternatively, perhaps only one substitution is possible because the other positions are not activated enough.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the possible products again. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction leads to substitution at positions 3 and 4, that would be two products. If substitution occurs at three positions, then three products.

Wait, let's think about the possible positions where NH2- could attack. If the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2, the possible positions for substitution would be influenced by both substituents.

Br at 1 is meta-directing, so meta positions are 3 and 5. D at 2 is ortho/para-directing, so ortho positions are 1 and 3, and para is 4.

So, the positions that are both meta to Br and ortho/para to D are position 3. Position 4 is para to D but not meta to Br. Position 5 is meta to Br but not ortho/para to D. So, perhaps substitution can occur at position 3 and position 4.

Wait, but substitution at position 4 would be para to D. However, Br is at position 1, which is ortho to position 2 (D), so position 4 is para to D, which is at position 2. So, position 4 is across from position 2, which is para.

So, if substitution occurs at position 3 (which is meta to Br and ortho to D), and at position 4 (para to D), that would be two possible substitution sites. Hence, two products.

Wait, but what about position 6? Position 6 is ortho to Br at 1 and ortho to D at 2. But in that case, if substitution occurs at position 6, would that be possible? Let me see: position 6 is ortho to Br (position 1) and ortho to D (position 2). So, Br is a meta director, so position 6 is ortho to Br. But Br being deactivating, maybe substitution there is less favored.

Alternatively, position 6 might not be a favored site for substitution because Br is deactivating, and it's ortho to Br. So perhaps substitution only occurs at positions 3 and 4, leading to two products.

So, the number of possible products would be 2. Thus, the answer would be option C) 2.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to a ring with a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would produce multiple products.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps more than one double bond can form, but in benzene, that's not possible because all positions are conjugated. So, maybe elimination doesn't lead to multiple products.

Alternatively, if the reaction is substitution, and two possible positions are activated, leading to two products, then the answer is C) 2.

Wait, but another thought: the deuterium at position 2 might not influence the substitution as much as the Br. So, maybe the substitution only occurs at the meta position to Br, which are positions 3 and 5. So, substitution at 3 and 5 would give two products. But wait, if the ring is symmetric, perhaps positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, leading to only one product. But no, because the ring has substituents at 1 and 2, which would make positions 3 and 5 non-equivalent.

Wait, no. Let me draw the structure:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So, numbering is clockwise: 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, for substitution at position 3: it's meta to Br (position 1), and ortho to D (position 2). For substitution at position 5: it's meta to Br (1) and para to D (2), since position 5 is across from position 2. Wait, position 2 is at the top, position 5 would be two positions away in the other direction. So, perhaps substitution at position 5 is para to D.

So, substitution at 3 and 5 would be two different products, making option C) 2 correct.

Alternatively, substitution could also occur at position 4, which is para to D at 2. So, that's a third possible product, leading to three products. But would position 4 be a possible site?

Wait, position 4 is para to D at 2. But position 4 is also meta to Br at 1. So, if substitution occurs at position 4, it's meta to Br and para to D.

But in that case, the Br's deactivating effect might make that position less reactive. So, perhaps substitution only occurs at positions 3 and 5, leading to two products, making the answer C) 2.

Alternatively, perhaps position 6 is also a possible site. Position 6 is ortho to Br (1) and ortho to D (2). But Br is deactivating, so substitution there might be less favorable. So, maybe only positions 3 and 5 are possible, leading to two products.

Wait, but if the D at 2 directs substitution to position 6 (ortho to D), which is also ortho to Br, which is deactivating. So, substitution at position 6 would be influenced by both substituents. But I'm not sure if that's favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the substituents direct the substitution to the same position. For example, if both substituents direct substitution to position 3, then only one product forms.

But in this case, Br directs to 3 and 5, and D directs to 3 and 6. So, position 3 is a common site. Then, substitution could occur at 3, leading to one product. But I'm not sure about position 4.

Wait, maybe the reaction only allows substitution at position 3, leading to a single product. That would make the answer B) 1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that substitution could occur at 3 and 5, leading to two products. So, I'm a bit confused.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling leading to a biaryl structure, but I don't see a coupling partner here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but under these conditions, that seems unlikely.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to think about what NaNH2 in ammonia does in aromatic chemistry. Oh, wait! NaNH2 is often used in the Birch reduction, but that's with a different solvent (like ethanol). Alternatively, in some cases, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation, like in the formation of alkenes from haloarenes.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But in benzene, all the carbons are already double-bonded. So, perhaps the ring becomes a diradical or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzynes intermediate. Benzyne is a aryne, a benzene ring with a triple bond. Formation of benzyne typically involves the elimination of two substituents, like two halogens, or a halogen and a proton, to form a triple bond.

In this case, the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. If the base abstracts the D at 2, perhaps leading to the elimination of Br and a proton, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.

So, the reaction would produce benzyne (aryne) with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But benzyne is a high-energy molecule and can undergo various reactions, such as cycloaddition or rearrangement.

But the question is about the possible organic products in this reaction. If the reaction produces benzyne, which is highly strained, it might not be the final product but an intermediate. Alternatively, benzyne might dimerize or undergo other reactions.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at benzyne. Maybe benzyne can rearrange or add something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if elimination occurs, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's part of the existing conjugated system, so it's not possible. So, perhaps the reaction forms a diradical or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's an amine. For example, substitution of Br with NH2.

But then, considering the directing effects, if substitution occurs at position 3 and 5, that would be two products, or perhaps only position 4 if that's the only possible site.

Wait, but the presence of two substituents (Br and D) complicates the directing effects. Let me think about this again.

In a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can have additive or opposing directing effects. For example, if one is meta-directing and the other is ortho/para-directing, the possible sites for substitution would be where their effects overlap.

In this case, Br at 1 is meta-directing, and D at 2 is ortho/para-directing.

So, the possible positions where substitution could occur would be positions that are meta to Br and ortho/para to D.

Looking at the positions:

- Position 3: meta to Br (1), ortho to D (2). So, this position is influenced by both substituents. So, substitution could occur here.

- Position 4: para to D (2), meta to Br (1). So, this position is influenced by both substituents as well.

- Position 5: meta to Br (1), para to D (2) (since D is at 2, position 5 is two positions away in the other direction). Wait, no: the para position to D (2) would be position 6, because in benzene, the para position is across the ring.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the positions. For a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2:

Positions are arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a circle.

So, substituent at 2 (D) would have para position at 6 (since 2 and 6 are across from each other). Ortho positions are 1 and 3.

Substituent at 1 (Br) has meta positions at 3 and 5.

So, position 3 is ortho to D (2) and meta to Br (1).

Position 4: is it influenced by either substituent? Position 4 is meta to D (2), which is an ortho/para director. So, D at 2 would direct to positions 1 (ortho), 3 (meta to D?), and 6 (para). Wait, no, ortho/para directors direct to ortho, para positions relative to themselves.

So, for D at 2, para is 6. Ortho are 1 and 3.

Br at 1, being a meta director, directs to 3 and 5.

So, the overlapping positions where both substituents direct substitution are position 3. Because position 3 is meta to Br (1) and ortho to D (2).

Another possible position is position 6, which is para to D (2) and meta to Br (1) (since position 6 is meta to 1). So, position 6 is influenced by both substituents.

Wait, let me check:

Position 6:

- Br at 1: position 6 is meta to 1 (since 1, 3, 5 are meta positions for 1).

- D at 2: position 6 is para to 2.

So, position 6 is a possible site for substitution, as it's meta to Br and para to D.

Thus, substitution could occur at positions 3 and 6, leading to two possible products.

Wait, but position 6 is also ortho to Br (1), which is a deactivating group. So, substitution at position 6 may not be favored because of the deactivating effect of Br.

Hmm, perhaps only position 3 is a favorable site for substitution. So, only one product would form.

But wait, another thought: if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br, perhaps leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would create a triple bond? Or perhaps a diradical.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with an amino group at position 3 or 6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at 6, and Br leaves as Br-, leading to a new structure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at position 3 and position 4. But earlier analysis suggested that position 4 is para to D and meta to Br.

Wait, position 4 is across from position 2 (D), so it's para to D. And position 4 is meta to Br (since Br is at 1; meta positions are 3 and 5). So, position 4 is not meta to Br, it's para to D. So, perhaps substitution at position 4 is directed by D but not by Br.

So, substitution could occur at position 3 (directed by both Br and D), position 4 (directed by D), position 5 (directed by Br), and position 6 (directed by D but deactivating by Br).

But considering the deactivating effect of Br, substitution at positions 5 and 6 might be less likely.

So, perhaps only position 3 is a viable site for substitution, leading to a single product.

If that's the case, the number of products would be 1, making option B) correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if substitution occurs at positions 3 and 6, that would be two products, making option C) correct.

Wait, but I think that in the presence of two substituents, the most activated position would be where both substituents are directing. So, position 3 is influenced by both Br and D, making it the most likely site for substitution. So, only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at position 4, which is para to D and not influenced by Br, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is a tough one. I think I'm going to go with the earlier conclusion that substitution occurs at position 3 and 6, but considering the deactivating effect of Br, perhaps only position 3 is possible, leading to one product. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the presence of D at 2 (which is like H) makes position 6 para to D. So, substitution could occur there. But Br is at 1, which is ortho to 6. Br is deactivating, so substitution at 6 would be less favored. Hence, perhaps substitution only occurs at position 3.

If that's the case, only one product forms, so the answer is B) 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I'm stuck between options B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to benzyne, which is a single product. So, the answer would be B) 1.

Wait, but the formation of benzyne would require elimination of HBr, which would involve losing Br and D. Wait, no, the base abstracts a proton, leading to the elimination of Br. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that's just one product, so the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, could the triple bond form between different positions, leading to multiple products? No, because the starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2, so elimination would only form a triple bond between 1 and 2.

So, if the reaction forms benzyne (aryne) as the product, there's only one possible product. Thus, the answer would be B) 1.

But earlier I thought substitution might lead to two products, but if elimination is the main pathway, then it's only one product.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. But considering that NaNH2 is a strong base and the reaction conditions are for dehydrohalogenation, perhaps the elimination pathway is more favorable, leading to only one product.

So, the number of possible organic products is 1. The answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The compound is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Bromine is a deactivating, meta-directing group, while deuterium (like hydrogen) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia is a strong base, often facilitating elimination reactions. The reaction conditions suggest that the bromine at position 1 may act as a leaving group, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne or arine) via dehydrohalogenation.

3. **Possible Reaction Pathways**:  
   - **Substitution**: For nucleophilic aromatic substitution to occur, the ring must be strongly activated. However, bromine is a deactivating group, making direct substitution unlikely unless strongly activated by another substituent. The deuterium at position 2 is an ortho/para-directing group, but its effect is weak compared to the deactivating influence of bromine. Thus, substitution is unlikely to proceed efficiently.  
   - **Elimination**: The strong base NaNH₂ can abstract a proton (or deuterium) from the benzene ring, leading to the elimination of HBr (or HD) and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. This forms benzyne, a highly strained intermediate, which is the most plausible product under these conditions.

4. **Number of Products**:  
   - If elimination occurs, the product is a single compound: benzyne with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - Substitution at other positions (e.g., 3, 4, or 6) is unlikely due to the deactivating nature of bromine and the weak activating effect of deuterium.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The reaction conditions favor elimination over substitution, leading to the formation of a single product: benzyne. Therefore, there is only one possible organic product in this reaction.
