Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation of P_z might involve some calculation.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Hmm, I should double-check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values. 

So, (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized, which is good.

Now, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>. But wait, the state is in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Oh, right, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which might simplify things.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. But the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That means that when I write the state as a vector in this basis, each component corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z.

So, the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Each component represents the amplitude for each P_z eigenstate. The eigenvalues of P_z can be found from its matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix: diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective basis states.

So, the state |ψ> can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So, each component in the vector corresponds to the coefficient of each eigenstate. 

So, <P_z> is the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalue multiplied by the square of the amplitude for that eigenstate.

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the expectation value <P_z> is the sum over all basis states of (coefficient)^2 * (eigenvalue of P_z). Because each coefficient squared gives the probability of being in that eigenstate, and each eigenstate has its own eigenvalue.

So, let's compute this. Each component is the coefficient (amplitude), so the probability is the square of the absolute value. But since all components here are real, it's just the square.

So, the three components are:

First component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. The corresponding eigenvalue is ħ.

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. The eigenvalue is 0.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. The eigenvalue is -ħ.

So, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 

Which is (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) )= 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, what about <P_z²>? Well, since in each eigenstate, P_z² would just be the square of the eigenvalue. So each eigenvalue is either ħ, 0, or -ħ. Squared, they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So, <P_z²> is sum of (coefficient^2) * (eigenvalue squared).

So again, the components are:

1/4 * (ħ²) + 1/2 * (0) + 1/4 * (ħ²) 

Adding them up: (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = (2 ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So, <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would fit. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, I can think about the state vector in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation of P_z is zero because the positive and negative contributions cancel out. But the expectation of P_z squared is the average of the squares, which is (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2, so the square root gives the uncertainty as ħ / sqrt(2). 

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\hbar$, with the state vector given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state $|\psi\rangle$ is expressed in this basis, so the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{4}$,
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$,
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Squaring these gives $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$,
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$,
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
