Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about transiting planets. Hmm, let's see. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so that's the key here. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

Wait, the question says both planets were detected via the RV method. Oh right, RV gives us the minimum mass of the planet and the orbital period. But for transit probability, I think it's more about the orbital parameters, like the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

The planets have the same mass, so that might not matter directly. Their orbital periods are different though. Planet 1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet 2. So Planet 1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means a smaller orbit (assuming same mass star, but wait the stars aren't the same here).

Wait, the host stars have different masses. Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting, so even though Planet 1's star is more massive, they have the same radius. So the star's radius is same for both.

Transit probability formula—what's that again? Oh right, the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a^2 + d^2)) where d is the distance between the planet's orbit and our line of sight. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbit is edge-on enough. Oh wait, maybe transit probability is approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (sin i))), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way to think about it is the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is correct. 

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but for circular orbits e=0, so it simplifies. Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (sin i)) ), but I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe the key factors are (R_p / R_s)^2 and the orbital separation. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. The bigger the planet relative to the star, the higher the chance. But also, the planet's orbit needs to be aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability of this alignment is higher when the star is larger, but wait, no, because if the star is larger, the area the planet has to cross is bigger. Wait, no, actually, the probability is higher when the star is smaller because the planet's disk is a larger fraction of the star's disk. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting that backwards.

Wait, the transit probability is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, multiplied by some function of the orbital parameters. Or perhaps it's more about the relative size of the orbit. Let me try to recall the formula.

Oh, I think the formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius. Or maybe the probability is higher for planets that are closer to their stars because they have a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but I'm not certain. Let me think about the factors.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for a transit) is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (sqrt(1-e²)) )) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's 1/a. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the RV method tells us the minimum mass, but for the transit probability, the inclination is a factor. But wait, the RV method tells us the mass function, which depends on sin i, where i is the inclination. But since they've already detected the planets via RV, does that imply anything about their inclinations? Or does the RV method not tell us the exact inclination, but gives the minimum mass?

Wait, in this question, the RV method has been used, so we know their minimum masses but not necessarily their true masses. But the question is about the probability of transiting, which depends on the actual inclination. So if the RV method gives a minimum mass, that implies that the actual mass could be higher if the inclination is higher. But for the transit probability, the RV method doesn't directly affect it unless we know the inclination. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the key here is to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting when observed. The probability depends on:

1. The ratio (R_p / R_s)^2. So if both planets have the same mass (same R_p?), wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the planets have the same masses. But mass doesn't directly translate to radius unless we know their densities. Oh, right, the question doesn't state that the planets have the same radius, only the same mass. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, but the transit probability depends on the planet's radius, not mass. Unless I can assume that same mass implies same radius, but that's not necessarily true. For example, a low-mass planet could be a gas giant with a larger radius, but in this case, both are Earth-like. Oh, the question states they are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar. Or perhaps I should consider that same mass doesn't imply same radius, but given that they're Earth-like, maybe their radii are similar. Wait, the question says "Earth-like planets," so I can assume they have approximately the same radius as Earth. So R_p is the same for both? Or is there a way to relate their radii to their masses if their densities are different?

Wait, if the planets have the same mass but different densities, their radii would differ. But the question doesn't give any info on their radii, only that the host stars have the same radius. So perhaps I'm to ignore the planet's radius and only consider the star's radius and orbital period. But that might not be correct because the transit probability does depend on R_p as well.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question states that both planets are Earth-like, so their radii should be similar to Earth's. So for the purposes of this problem, perhaps R_p is the same for both.

But let's read the question again. The question says, "the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets are known." So the host stars' radii are the same. The host stars have same R_s.

Now, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)) )

But wait, I think another way to think about it is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. The probability of the edge-on alignment is 1/(a * d), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a)) because for a given star and planet size, the farther away the planet is, the less likely we are to see a transit.

Wait, another approach from my notes: The probability that a randomly oriented orbit leads to a transit is about (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but for circular orbits, it's (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1/(a)). Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's 1/a.

Wait, but in this problem, the planets have the same mass. But mass doesn't directly give R_p unless we know the density. So perhaps I need to think of other factors.

Wait, maybe I can relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law. Since both planets are around their respective stars, we can find their semi-major axes.

Kepler's third law is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p << M_s for planets, we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/(G M_s)) a^3.

So a^3 = (G M_s P²)/(4π²)

But since both planets have the same mass, but their stars have different masses. Let me compute the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Let me denote M1 as the mass of Planet 1's star, which is twice that of Planet 2's star (M2 = M1/2). The orbital period of Planet 1 is P1 = P2/3.

Wait, no: the question says Planet 1 has three times shorter orbital period than Planet 2. So P1 = P2 /3.

So for Planet 1:

a1^3 = (G M1 (P1)^2)/(4π²)

Similarly, for Planet 2:

a2^3 = (G M2 (P2)^2)/(4π²)

Substituting M2 = M1 /2 and P1 = P2/3:

a1^3 = (G M1 (P2/3)^2 )/(4π²) = (G M1 P2²)/(9 *4π² )

a2^3 = (G (M1/2) P2² )/(4π² )

So a1^3 = (G M1 P2² )/(36 π² )

a2^3 = (G M1 P2² )/(8 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (1/36) / (1/8) ) = 8/36 = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63.

So a1 is about 0.63 times a2.

Wait, but wait: Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 something, yeah.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet 1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet 2 and is orbiting a more massive star. So it's closer to its star.

Now, back to the transit probability. Assuming that R_p is the same for both planets (since they're Earth-like and same mass), and R_s is same for both stars, the (R_p/R_s)^2 term is the same for both planets.

The other factor is 1/a. So the transit probability for each planet is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a).

So since (R_p/R_s)^2 is the same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 ≈ 0.63 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.587.

Wait, because a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63 → a2 / a1 ≈ 1/0.63 ≈ 1.587.

So P1 is approximately 1.587 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that Planet 1 has a higher probability.

But the options are about which is preferred. The researchers want to observe the one with higher probability, so if Planet 1 has higher P, they'd choose Planet 1.

Looking at the options:

Options C and D suggest Planet 1 is preferred.

Option C says ~1.65 times higher, which is close to our 1.587.

Wait, 1.587 is approximately 1.6 times. So option C says 1.65 times, which is near that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute a1 and a2.

Given M1 = 2 M2 → M2 = M1/2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = ( G * M1 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = ( G * (M1/2) * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1^3)/(a2^3) = [ (G M1 (P2²/9) ) ] / [ (G (M1/2) P2²) ) ] = [ (M1 * P2²/9) ] / [ (M1/2) P2² ) ] = (1/9) * 2 / 1 = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

(2/9) is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So P1 ∝ 1/a1 = 1/(0.606 a2) = (1.65) * (1/a2).

Since P2 ∝ 1/a2, P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the transit probability of Planet 1 is approx 1.65 times higher than Planet 2.

So the researchers would prefer Planet 1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: higher (~2.7 times) but that's way higher.

Wait, our calculation gives P1/P2 ≈ 1.65. So option C is correct.

So the answer should be C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information and apply the principles of transit probability. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared, as well as the orbital separation. The formula for transit probability is approximately:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Key Information:
1. **Planets**: Both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, implying similar radii (\(R_p\)).
2. **Host Stars**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), but Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's star.
3. **Orbital Periods**: Planet 1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet 2 (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law for circular orbits:
\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]
where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star. For Planet 1 and Planet 2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's star).
- \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\).

Substituting into the formula:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_2 \cdot P_1^2}{M_1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{(M_2) \cdot (P_2 / 3)^2}{(2M_2) \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{1}{18}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1}{18}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(1/a\)) and directly proportional to \((R_p / R_s)^2\). Since both planets have the same radius and both stars have the same radius, the \((R_p / R_s)^2\) term is constant for both planets. Therefore, the transit probability ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet 1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet 2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers prefer to observe the planet with the higher transit probability. Since Planet 1 has a transit probability 1.65 times higher than Planet 2, the correct choice is:
