Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The observation is that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of its star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is asking: what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots? So, they want Rpl (planet radius) divided by Rstar (star radius), right?

Hmm, I remember that the dip in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. So when a planet passes in front, the light we lose is (Rp/R*)^2 of the star's total light.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip; it's these dark spots. So I need to figure out the equivalent effect of these spots on the star's brightness variation as a planet would.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by the spots. Wait, but only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh, right, so the spots are on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a periodic change in brightness.

But how does this compare to the planet transit scenario?

Let me think: when a planet transits, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area blocked, (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But with spots, the dip is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower because those cooler regions are emitting less light. The variation in brightness depends on the difference in brightness between the spots and the rest of the star.

Wait, so the total brightness of the star is the sum of the brightness from all its surface. The spots contribute less because they are cooler. The star's total flux is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4πRstar²) * (filling factor) * (1 - filling factor) ? Wait, not exactly. Let's think in terms of flux.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) / (4π D^2), but for this problem, perhaps I can ignore the distance as it's about relative changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the star's brightness as the sum of two components: the normal surface and the spotted regions.

The normal surface emits at T_eff = 6000 K. The spots are at T_spot = 5000 K. The filling factor f is 20% (0.2), so 20% of the star's surface is spots, and 80% is normal.

So the total flux from the star is F_total = F_normal + F_spots.

Each part is calculated as:

F_normal = sigma * T_eff^4 * (0.8) * (Rstar^2 * 4π) / (4π D^2) ) 

Wait, but actually, when we calculate the flux from a part of the star, the area is the fraction (filling factor) times the total area. So, the flux from the normal part is f_normal * sigma * T_eff^4 * (Rstar² / D²), where f_normal is 0.8 (since 20% is spots). Similarly, the flux from the spots is f_spot * sigma * T_spot^4 * (Rstar^2 / D²).

So total flux F_total = (0.8 * sigma * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * sigma * T_spot^4 ) * (Rstar^2 / D² )

When the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. But wait, the question says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when viewed from Earth, as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere will rotate in and out of view. So the brightness variation will be periodic as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

The maximum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is away from us (so we see the non-spotted side), and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait no, wait. Because the star is a sphere, so when we're looking at one hemisphere, the other is on the back. So when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them. So the brightness would be higher when the spots are on the far side (since they're contributing less to the flux when they're on our side). Hmm, maybe I should model the brightness variation.

Let me think of the star as a sphere. The flux we receive is proportional to the sum of the flux from each visible part. So the total flux when a certain hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the contributions from the parts we can see.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side, meaning that all the spots are not contributing to our view. The minimum brightness is when the spots are fully on the front, so we see all the spots.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on only one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spotted side will come into view and then go away. So when the spotted side is facing us, the spots are in front, and when it's rotated away, we don't see them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in our view, so the flux is lower. When the star rotates so that the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the back side, so their flux doesn't contribute. The brightness thus oscillates between a lower value (when spots are visible) and a higher value (when they're not).

Wait, no. Because, when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them, so the flux is higher. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted side is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotted side is facing us. So the variation in flux would be F_max - F_min.

Wait, but the problem is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and the minimum brightness divided by the average brightness, perhaps. Or is it just the difference?

Wait, when modeling a transit, the dip in brightness is (Rp/R*)^2. But in this case, the dip is due to a temperature difference. So the dip would be the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are not visible (all normal surface) and when as much of the spots as possible are visible.

But wait, the star is only partially covered with spots, and only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible changes. Let me model this.

The star has a radius Rstar, and the spots cover a fraction f (0.2) of one hemisphere. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the surface area, right? So the total area of the star is 4π Rstar². So the area covered by spots is f * (2π Rstar²) because a hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20% of the star's surface. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π Rstar² = 0.8π R². So each hemisphere is 2π R², so the 0.8π R² of spots would cover 40% of one hemisphere. Because 0.8π / 2π = 0.4, 40%. So the spots cover 40% of one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the hemisphere is spots, so the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots would be 0.4/2 = 0.2. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think of the star's surface as a sphere. The filling factor f is the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. So f=0.2 means 20% of the entire star is spots.

So when the star rotates, the fraction of the spots that are visible depends on the rotation. When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, then the visible spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Wait, no. Because the spotty area is 20% of the entire star, which is distributed on one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps when the star rotates, the visible fraction of spots changes. So when the spotty hemisphere is exactly facing us, the entire 20% of spots is visible. When it's rotated by 180 degrees, the spotty hemisphere is on the back, so 0% is visible.

But in reality, as the star rotates, the fraction of spots visible varies sinusoidally. The variation in brightness would reach a maximum when the spotty hemisphere is edge-on, and the minimum when it's fully visible.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is due to the changing area of the spots that is visible. So the maximum change in brightness would occur when the spots are moving across the star's disk, and the variation in the flux would be the difference between when all the spots are visible and when none are.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum and minimum fluxes can be calculated based on the rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum and minimum fluxes are when the entire spotted area is facing us or away.

Wait, what's the maximum flux? It's when the spots are on the back side, so we see the entire star's normal surface. The flux is F_max = sigma * T_eff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) / (4π D^2) ) * (1 - f) + sigma * T_spot^4 * (4π Rstar^2)* f / (4π D^2) ) * (when spots are on the far side, but no, wait. No, if the spots are on the far side, we don't see them. So F_max is when the normal surface is fully visible.

Wait, but no, wait. The star has 20% spots on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. When it's rotated, the spots are on the far side. So F_max is when the spots are on the far side and not visible, so the flux is when all the star's surface is at T_eff. Or wait, no. Because the other side is the same as the spotted side, but the spots are on one hemisphere only. So when the star rotates, the other side is the same as the spotted one, but we can't see those spots because they're on the back. So when the star is viewed from Earth, we only see the front hemisphere, which has spots.

Wait, no, because it's a sphere. When the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots on that side. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (non-spotted) is facing us, but wait, the non-spotted hemisphere has no spots? Or does the star have spots only on one hemisphere, meaning that the other hemisphere is spotless?

Wait, the question says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. So the other hemisphere is not spotty. So when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the total area is spots, and 80% is normal. But when the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, so all the visible area is normal, so the flux is higher.

Wait, but the area we see is a hemisphere. So when the star is viewed face-on from Earth, we see a hemisphere. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 20% of the star's surface as spots and 80% as normal. But if the star is a sphere, when it's viewed edge-on, perhaps we see more of the star's surface, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation in flux is due to the spots being in or out of view as the star rotates. So the maximum and minimum fluxes will be when the entire spotted area is visible or not.

But wait, the star's rotation makes the spots come into and out of view. Since the spots are on only one hemisphere, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots visible is 20% of the star's disk. So the flux would be lower because those spots contribute less. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher.

So the maximum flux F_max is when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum flux F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So we can calculate F_max and F_min. The amplitude of the brightness variation would be (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, but perhaps the question is looking for the dip, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_max or something similar.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation resembles the presence of an exoplanet. So the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. The dip caused by the spots is the difference between F_max and F_min divided by F_max (because when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/R*)^2 of the total flux). Wait, no, the dip is the loss of flux when the planet covers part of the star. So the dip is (Rp/R*)^2 * F_total, but in the case of spots, the dip is F_max - F_min.

So we need to set F_max - F_min equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's model this.

The exoplanet transit causes a dip in brightness of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The star with spots has a variation in brightness of F_min = (when spotted hemisphere is visible) to F_max (non-spotted hemisphere visible).

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min).

Wait, I think the dip caused by the planet is (Rp/R*)^2 * F_total.

The dip caused by the spots is (F_max - F_min).

So, to find Rpl such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_total = F_max - F_min.

Wait, but let me think again. When the planet transits, the brightness drops by (Rp/R*)^2 * F_total. So the dip is the loss of that area's flux. Similarly, when the spots are on the front, the brightness is lower by the amount of flux from the spots. So when the star's brightness is at F_min, the flux is F_total * (1 - (f_spot * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ), perhaps? Or not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma*Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2). But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * sigma*Tspot^4 * (Rstar^2)/(Rstar^2) ) — no, wait, because the spots cover f of the area, the flux would be F = (1 - f) * sigma*Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) + f * sigma*Tspot^4 * (4π Rstar^2)/(4π) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, the star's normal flux is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²)/(4π D²) ), which simplifies to sigma Teff^4 Rstar² / D².

The spots contribute F_spots = f * sigma * Tspot^4 * (Rstar² / D²), since they cover f of the area.

So the total flux when the star is viewed with the spots is F = (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 R²/D² + f sigma Tspot^4 R²/D².

F = (sigma R²/D²) [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ]

So the maximum flux F_max is when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, when the non-spotted hemisphere is viewed, all the spots are on the far side, so their flux doesn't contribute. So F_max = (sigma R²/D²) [ (1) Teff^4 + 0 ] = sigma R² Teff^4 / D².

Wait, no. Wait, the star has 20% spots on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so their flux doesn't contribute. So in that case, the flux is F_max = sigma R² Teff^4 / D².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_min = (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * Tspot^4, all multiplied by sigma R² / D².

So F_min = sigma R²/D² [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ]

Thus, the variation in flux is F_max - F_min = sigma R² / D² [ Teff^4 - ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ) ) ]

Simplify that:

= sigma R²/D² [ Teff^4 - (1-f)Teff^4 - f Tspot^4 ]

= sigma R²/D² [ f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 ) ]

Because:

Teff^4 - (1-f) Teff^4 = f Teff^4.

So F_max - F_min = sigma R²/D² * f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 )

Now, the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_total, where F_total is the star's normal flux. Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip of (Rp/R*)^2 times the total flux.

Wait, the total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 Rstar² / D².

The dip when the planet transits is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So we can set this dip equal to the variation from the spots: F_max - F_min = (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

Wait, but wait. The variation due to spots is F_max - F_min, which is the dip when the spots are on the front. So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, perhaps.

Wait, no. Let's think. For the planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. For the spots, the dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, which is the relative dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model both in terms of relative brightness.

The dip due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The dip due to the spots being on the front is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

So we can set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Because, for the planet, the dip is (Rp/R*)^2, and for the spots, the dip would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

So let's compute (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

We have:

F_max = sigma R²/D² Teff^4,

F_min = sigma R²/D² [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ]

So (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [ F_max - F_min ] / F_max

= [ sigma R²/D² (Teff^4 - (1-f) Teff^4 - f Tspot^4 ) ] / [ sigma R²/D² Teff^4 ]

The sigma R²/D² cancels, so:

= [ Teff^4 - (1-f) Teff^4 - f Tspot^4 ] / Teff^4

= [ f Teff^4 - f Tspot^4 ] / Teff^4

= f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 ) / Teff^4

Factor that:

= f [ 1 - (Tspot^4 / Teff^4) ]

= f [ 1 - (Tspot / Teff )^4 ]

Given that Teff = 6000 K, Tspot = 5000 K. f=0.2.

So let's compute the value.

Compute (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.2:

0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So (F_max - F_min) / F_max ≈ 0.10355.

So the relative dip is about 10.355% when the spots are fully visible.

So the dip due to the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Wait, but wait: the dip due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So setting that equal to the relative dip from the spots.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Take the square root:

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. Option C is ~0.11, which would be the square of 0.32.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. The dip due to the planet is when the planet covers part of the star, blocking that light. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the dip is F_max - F_min. So when the spots are fully visible, the flux is lower by F_max - F_min. So the dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, which is about 0.10355.

Wait, but the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32. So option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the dip in brightness when the planet transits is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2).

The amplitude of the star with spots is the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. So the dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max ≈ 0.10355, which is about 10.355% dip.

So to get the same dip, a planet would need to block (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. I'm modeling the dip as (Rp/Rstar)^2. But in reality, when a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but when the star's brightness is modulated by spots, the dip is the difference in flux when the spots are present. So the dip is F_max - F_min. Which is the absolute dip, not the fractional.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. When the planet transits, the dip is a fraction of the total flux. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, as a fraction of F_total.

Wait, no. The flux without any planet is F0. When the planet transits, the flux is F0 - F_blocked, where F_blocked is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0. So the dip is F_blocked/F0 = (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2).

In the case of the star with spots, the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, which is F_max - F_min. But F_max is the flux when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, and F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So F_max is the flux without any spots visible. F_min is the flux when all the spots are visible.

So F_max = F0.

F_min = F0 * [ (1-f) * (Teff^4) + f (Tspot^4) ) ] / Teff^4.

Wait, this is because F_min = (1-f)*F0 * (Teff^4) + f*F0*(Tspot^4) ) / (F0) )? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I should define F0 as the flux when the entire surface is at Teff. So F0 = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi Rstar²)/(4 pi D²) ) = sigma Teff^4 Rstar² / D².

In which case, F_min = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ] * sigma Rstar² / D².

So the dip is F_max - F_min.

F_max is F0.

So dip = F0 - F_min = F0 [ 1 - ( (1 - f) + f (Tspot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

= F0 [ 1 - (1 - f) - f (Tspot^4 / Teff^4) ) + f ]

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

F_min = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ] * (sigma R²/D²)

F_max = Teff^4 * sigma R²/D².

So dip = F_max - F_min = sigma R²/D² [ Teff^4 - ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ) ]

= sigma R²/D² [ Teff^4 (1 - (1-f)) - f Tspot^4 ]

= sigma R²/D² [ f Teff^4 - f Tspot^4 ]

= f sigma R²/D² (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 )

The planet's dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So set dip_spots = dip_planet:

f sigma R^2/D^2 (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * sigma R^2/D^2 Teff^4.

Cancel out sigma R^2/D^2 from both sides:

f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2 ) Teff^4.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4 ) / Teff^4

= f (1 - (Tspot^4 / Teff^4) )

= f [1 - (Tspot / Teff )^4 ]

As before.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and dark spots covering 20% (filling factor \( f = 0.2 \)) of one hemisphere. The spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The brightness variation caused by the spots depends on the difference in flux between the spotted and unspotted regions.

The total flux from the star is proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
F_{\text{total}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot (1 - f) + \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \cdot f
\]

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is higher. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux between these two states:

\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}
\]

Here:
- \( F_{\text{max}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \) (flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible),
- \( F_{\text{min}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot (1 - f) + \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \cdot f \) (flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible).

The relative brightness variation is:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( f = 0.2 \):

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
\]

First, calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):

\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.482) = 0.2 \cdot 0.518 \approx 0.1036
\]

This corresponds to a relative brightness variation of approximately \( 10.36\% \).

For an exoplanet transiting the star, the brightness variation is given by:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

**Critical Analysis of Options:**
- **A) ~0.39**: Too large; exceeds the calculated value.
- **B) ~0.07**: Too small; does not match the calculated value.
- **C) ~0.11**: Incorrect; this represents the square of the correct value.
- **D) ~0.32**: Correct; matches the calculated value.
