Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves spin states and operators, and I need to find probabilities and an average value. Hmm.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component of spin. I think that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin states. So |alpha> is a linear combination of these two states.

First, I think I should normalize this state because probabilities depend on the norm. The normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. Let me calculate that.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2-i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no, actually, the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the actual |alpha> is that combination divided by the norm. So after normalization, it's (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The matrix would look like this:

Row 1: A_11=0, A_12= ħ/2
Row 2: A_21= ħ/2, A_22=0

So the matrix is:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, that's interesting. I think this is a spin operator in the x-direction or something else. Oh wait, wait, no. The standard Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli matrices have entries like σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Ah, so operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. That makes sense. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because A is a scalar multiple of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe it's the other way around, but the key is that they are the eigenstates of σ_x.

But wait, the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of operator A. So to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

So the first step is to write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+A> and |-A>, corresponding to the eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. Because A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A>. Let me write |+A> and |-A> in terms of |up> and |down>.

As I said earlier, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, assuming |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-A> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but I should double-check. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So yes, |+A> = |+x>, and |-A> = |-x>.

So now, I can express |alpha> as a combination of |+A> and |-A>.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+A> + c_- |-A>

So I need to find c_+ and c_-.

In terms of |up> and |down>, |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

And |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-A> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's write |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write |up> and |down> in terms of |+A> and |-A>.

Since |up> = (|+A> + |-A>)/sqrt(2),
and |down> = (|+A> - |-A>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+A> + |-A>)/sqrt(2) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (|+A> - |-A>)/sqrt(2)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(14):

= [ (1+i)(|+A> + |-A>) + (2 - i)(|+A> - |-A>) ] / sqrt(14)

Expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+A> + (1+i)|-A> + (2 - i)|+A> - (2 - i)|-A>

Combine like terms:

[ (1+i + 2 -i) |+A> ] + [ (1+i -2 +i) |-A> ]

Simplify coefficients:

For |+A>: (1 + 2) + (i -i) ) → (3) |+A> 

Wait, 1+i + 2 - i → (1+2) + (i -i) → 3 + 0i =3.

For |-A>: (1 + i) - (2 -i) → [1-2] + [i +i] → (-1) + (2i) → -1 + 2i.

Wait, let me double-check that: 

(1+i) from the first term, then - (2 -i) from the last term. So (1+i) + ( -2 + i ) = (1-2) + (i + i) ) → (-1) + 2i.

So the numerator becomes 3 |+A> + (-1 + 2i) |-A>.

So |alpha> = [3 |+A> + (-1 + 2i) |-A> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, does that make sense? So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) for |+A>, and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) for |-A>.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to |+A> is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient c_+, which is |3|^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... which is approximately 0.64.

Similarly, the probability for |-A> is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / 14. Let's compute that: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5 → 5/14 ≈0.357142... which is about 0.36, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that again. The coefficient is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (−1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So the probability is 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Oh, 9/14 is 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, let me check the computation again. Because when I expressed |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A>, I have:

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14)
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

So |c_+|² = (3² +0 ) /14 =9/14≈0.642857.
|c_-|²= ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 =5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute 9/14: it's 0.642857..., which is option A's first number, 0.64. So the probabilities would be approximately 64% and 36%.

So the first part of the question is answered: the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which matches. But I should check the other options too.

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7

Option B) 0.54, 0.46, and 3 hbar/sqrt(7)

Option C) 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7)

Option D) 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7)

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, so only option A and maybe another have these numbers. So the probabilities are correct in option A.

But wait, wait a second. Did I get the probabilities correctly? Because the state |alpha> is written in terms of |+A> and |-A>, and their coefficients give the amplitudes. So the probabilities are the square of the magnitudes.

But another approach could be to compute the expectation value of A. Because the average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, perhaps I should compute that as well. Let me think.

So the operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. If I can compute <A>, that would be the average value. Alternatively, because |alpha> is written as a combination of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Hmm, so in the eigenbasis of A, the state |alpha> is c_+ |+A> + c_- |-A>, where c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the expectation value would be ( |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) ) + ( |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2) )

Which would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [9 * ħ/(2*14)] - [5 ħ/(2*14)] = (9-5)ħ/(28) ) = 4 ħ /28 = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

So option A says the probabilities are 0.64, 0.36, and average is ħ/7. So that would match.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me re-calculate the average value via another method to cross-verify.

Another method: using the matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

In vector form, the state is a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

The operator A is a matrix:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So to compute <A>, we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Which is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute |alpha> as a vector:

v = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Then, the conjugate transpose is v† = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, compute v† * A * v.

Matrix multiplication:

v† * A = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Which gives:

First element: (0 * (1-i) + ħ/2 * (2+i)) ) / sqrt(7)
Second element: (ħ/2 * (1-i) + 0 * (2+i)) ) / sqrt(7)

Wait no, perhaps it's better to compute A * v first.

Compute A * v:

A*v = [ [0*(1+i)/√7 + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/√7],
         [ (ħ/2)*(1+i)/√7 + 0*(2 -i)/√7 ] ]

So the first component is (ħ/2)(2 - i) / sqrt(7) = (2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) )

The second component is (ħ/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ) = (1 +i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, multiply v† with this result.

v† * (A * v) = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)), (1 +i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the dimensions. Let me correct that.

Wait, after A * v, we have a vector:

[ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ]
[ ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ( (2 -i) ) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) )
, ( (1 +i) ) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

So when we compute v† (A v), it's the dot product between v† and A v:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] • [ (2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)), (1 +i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

= [ (1-i)(2 -i) * ħ/(2 *7) ) + (2 +i)(1 +i) * ħ/(2 *7) ) ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2.

i^2 is -1, so this is 2 -3i -1 = (1 -3i).

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i^2 = 2 + 2i + i -1 = (1 + 3i).

So putting it all together:

[ (1 -3i) * ħ/(14) ) + (1 +3i) * ħ/(14) ) ]

= [ (1 -3i + 1 +3i ) * ħ/(14) ) ]

= [ (2) * ħ/(14) ) ] = (2 ħ) /14 = ħ/7.

So yes, the average value is ħ/7, which matches what I found earlier.

So the average is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back, when I wrote |alpha> in terms of |+A> and |-A>, I got c_+ =3/sqrt(14), and c_- = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So |c_-|² is | (-1 +2i) |^2 /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.357142, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A matches.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle
\]

Here, the normalization factor is \( \sqrt{7} \), ensuring \( |\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle| = 1 \).

### Step 1: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), denoted as \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \), corresponding to eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively. These eigenstates are:

\[
|+A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle), \quad |-A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle)
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \)
Substituting \( |{\uparrow}\rangle \) and \( |{\downarrow}\rangle \) in terms of \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \):

\[
|{\uparrow}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+A\rangle + |-A\rangle), \quad |{\downarrow}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+A\rangle - |-A\rangle)
\]

Substituting into \( |\alpha\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+A\rangle + |-A\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+A\rangle - |-A\rangle)
\]

Simplify:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) |+A\rangle + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) |-A\rangle \right]
\]

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3 |+A\rangle + (-1 + 2i) |-A\rangle \right]
\]

Thus, the coefficients are:

\[
c_{+} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_{-} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(|+A\rangle) = |c_{+}|^2 = \frac{3^2}{14} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-A\rangle) = |c_{-}|^2 = \frac{(-1 + 2i)(-1 - 2i)}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the eigenstate decomposition:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|+A\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|-A\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)
\]

Substitute the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)
\]

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
