Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I guess some of the equations change because of relativity effects.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator, mass m, maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. And we're looking for the maximum speed. Right, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But since it's relativistic, things are different because of the gamma factor or maybe because energy considerations change.

In special relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but maybe in this case, the oscillator's energy is considered in terms of relativistic momentum and so on.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Oh, but wait, in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is still the same, but the total energy includes relativistic effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to equate the total energy at maximum displacement (all potential) to the total energy at maximum speed (all kinetic, but relativistic), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, in the classical case, the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², which converts into kinetic energy at maximum speed. But in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², right?

So perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, at maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest? No, in the classical case, at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. But in reality, when the oscillator is moving, it's kinetic plus potential.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², so at maximum x (x=A), the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Then, when the oscillator is moving through the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic. So in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but that's the non-relativistic case.

But the question is about the relativistic case. So the approach must be different. Maybe the energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and that's converted into relativistic kinetic energy when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position.

Wait, but relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy is the sum of potential and kinetic, but in a relativistic framework, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Hmmm, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy. 

At maximum amplitude, the particle is at rest in the potential well, so its velocity is zero. So the total energy would be purely potential energy. But wait, in the relativistic case, would the potential energy be (1/2)kA²? Or does relativism change the potential?

Hmm, I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², assuming that the spring is described in the rest frame, so the potential doesn't depend on velocity. So at maximum amplitude, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc² (rest energy)? Or wait, no, mc² is the rest energy, and in the rest frame, the total energy would include that. Wait, but in the rest frame, wouldn't the spring's potential energy be in addition to the rest energy? So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but when the oscillator is moving, at the equilibrium point, the potential energy is zero (x=0), so all energy is kinetic. So the total energy at that point should still be the same. So the kinetic energy would be E_total - mc².

Wait, no, because in the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy. So (1/2)kA² (the maximum potential energy) plus the rest energy, m c², would be the total energy, which equals the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest energy at the equilibrium point.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². It's the sum of potential and kinetic. So when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential: (1/2)kA². When it's at x=0, all is kinetic: (1/2)mv_max².

In the relativistic case, the total energy would be E = (gamma) mc², because at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so gamma is maximum. So the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) mc².

Wait, so perhaps the approach is:

At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², but wait, that can't be right, because where's the rest energy?

Ah, I think I was wrong. The total energy in the oscillator's frame includes both the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, all energy is kinetic. So,

E = gamma mc².

So:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

mc² (gamma -1 ) = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma -1 = (k A²) / (2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as some variable, say, let's call it a. So,

gamma = 1 + a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for v.

First, take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2].

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ]

= [ (1 + a)^2 -1 ] / (1 + a)^2

= [1 + 2a + a² -1 ] / (1 + a)^2

= (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2

= a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But what is a? a = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 mc²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 mc²))) ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 mc²))]^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

a(2 + a) = (k A²/(2 mc²)) [ 2 + (k A²/(2 mc²)) ]

= [ k A²/(2 mc²) ] * [ (4 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute 2 + a as 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) = [ (4 mc²) + k A² ]/(2 mc²).

So,

a (2 + a) = (k A²/(2 mc²)) * [ (4 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]

= [k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 mc²)(2 mc²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator:

(1 + a)^2 = [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) ]^2

= [ (2 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]^2

= (2 mc² + k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ [k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Wait, the denominators are the same, so they cancel out.

So, v^2 = c² * [ k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Let me factor the numerator:

4 mc² + k A² = 2*(2 mc²) + k A².

Wait, but denominator is (2 mc² + k A²)^2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out k A² from numerator and denominator.

Let me write 4 mc² as 4 mc² = 2 * 2 mc², and 2 mc² is 2 mc².

Hmm, perhaps we can write the numerator as (k A²) * (4 mc² + k A²) = k A² (4 mc² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

So,

v^2 = c² * [ k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A² )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps factor 4 mc² as 2*(2 mc²):

Wait, 4 mc² = 2*(2 mc²). So,

v^2 = c² [k A² (2*(2 mc²) + k A² ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A^2 )^2 ]

= c² [ 2 k A² (2 mc²) + k^2 A^4 ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A^2 )^2 ]

Wait, but perhaps another approach: Let me factor k A² in numerator and denominator.

Let me factor out k A² from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k A² [ (4 mc²)/(k A²) + 1 ] 

Denominator: ( [2 mc²/(k A²) ] + 1 )^2.

Wait, but that might not help much.

Alternatively, let me factor out (2 mc²)^2 from numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 mc² + k A² )^2 = [2 mc² (1 + (k A²)/(2 mc^2) ) ]^2 = (2 mc²)^2 (1 + (k A²)/(2 mc^2) )^2.

Numerator: k A² (4 mc² + k A^2 ) = k A² (4 mc²) (1 + (k A²)/(4 mc²) )) = 4 mc² * k A^2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/(4 mc^2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me compute the expression again.

Wait, let me take the expression for v squared:

v² = c² * (k A² (4 mc² +k A² )) / (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

We can factor the denominator as (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

So, let me write numerator as k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) = k A² (2 mc² * 2 +k A² )

= 2 k A² * 2 mc² + (k A² )^2.

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor 4 mc² as 2*(2 mc²):

So,

Numerator: k A² [ 2*(2 mc²) + k A² ]

Denominator: (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

Let me factor 2 mc² + k A² as a common term.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to factor numerator as (2 mc² + k A² ) * something.

Wait, perhaps 4 mc² + k A² = 2*(2 mc²) +k A^2. So, if I write it as 2*(2 mc²) +k A^2, which is 2*(2 mc²) +k A^2 = (2 mc² + k A^2) + 2 mc².

Wait, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps let me factor out (2 mc² + k A²) from the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is k A² (4 mc² +k A² ) = k A² ( 2*(2 mc²) +k A² )

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck, so perhaps I should proceed to compute the expression in terms of a.

Let me restate what 'a' is. a = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

4 mc² +k A² = 4 mc² + (2 mc²) a.

So,

v² = c² [k A² (4 mc² + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 mc^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

But k A^2 = 2 mc^2 a.

So,

k A^2 = 2 mc² a → substitute this into expressions.

So,

4 mc² +k A^2 =4 mc² + 2 mc² a = 2 mc² (2 + a).

Similarly,

2 mc² +k A^2 = 2 mc² (1 + a/2 )

Wait, no. Let me compute:

2 mc² +k A² = 2 mc² + 2 mc² a = 2 mc² (1 + a ). 

Ah, because k A² = 2 mc² a.

So,

Denominator (2 mc² + k A² )^2 = [2 mc² (1+a)]^2 = 4 m² c^4 (1+a)^2.

Numerator:

k A² (4 mc² +k A^2 ) = (2 mc² a) * (2 mc² (2 + a) ) )

= 4 m² c^4 a (2 + a).

So, putting it all together,

v² = c² * [4 m² c^4 a (2 + a) ] / [4 m² c^4 (1+a)^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 m² c^4 cancels out.

So,

v^2 = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Which simplifies to:

v^2 = c² [ a(2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Now, substituting a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 ), which is a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2).

So,

v^2 = c² [ (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) * ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) )^2 ]

Let me write this as:

v^2 = c² [ (a) (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2,

since a = k A^2/(2 mc^2).

So,

v^2 = c² * [ a (2+a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Let me factor the numerator:

a(2 + a) = a (a + 2) = a (a + 2 ) = a (a + 2 )

Denominator: (1 + a )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2 = c² [ a (a+2) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Let me compute this expression:

a (a+2) = a^2 + 2 a.

Denominator: (a+1)^2= a^2 + 2 a +1.

So,

v^2 = c² [ (a^2 + 2 a ) ] / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

= c² [ (a^2 + 2 a ) / (a +1 )^2 ]

= c² [ (a (a + 2 )) / (a +1 )^2 ]

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator and denominator.

Hmm, not sure. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, the expressions have square roots and terms with kA²/(2m) or similar.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think about how to write v in terms of a.

Wait, from earlier, we have:

gamma = 1 + a.

And,

gamma = 1/( sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )

So,

gamma = 1/( sqrt( (1 - v²/c²) ) )

So,

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c^2 )

So,

1 - v²/c^2 = 1/gamma^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 )

But from earlier, gamma = 1 + a.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ]

= c^2 [ ( (1 +a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

= c^2 [ (1 + 2a + a^2 -1 ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

= c^2 [ (2a + a^2 ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

Which is the same expression as we derived earlier.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 +a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a) ) / (1 +a )

Now, let me write a as (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 mc²) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ]

Simplify the numerator inside the square root:

[ (k A²)/(2 mc²) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ] = [ (k A²)/(2 mc²) ] * [ (4 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]

Wait, 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) = [4 mc² + k A² ]/(2 mc² )

So,

Multiply by (k A²)/(2 mc² ):

= [k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 mc² )^2 ]

= [k A² (4 mc² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

sqrt( numerator ) = [ sqrt( k A² (4 mc² +k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 mc² )

Taking sqrt(k A²) is k A, and sqrt(4 mc^2 +k A^2 ) remains.

So,

sqrt( numerator ) = (k A sqrt(4 mc² + k A² )) / (2 mc² )

Then, denominator is 1 + a = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) = [ 2 mc² + k A^2 ]/(2 mc² )

So, putting it all together:

v = c * [ (k A sqrt(4 mc^2 +k A^2 )) / (2 mc^2 ) ] / [ (2 mc^2 +k A^2 )/(2 mc^2 ) ]

The (2 mc^2 ) in numerator and denominator cancel out, so:

v = c * [ k A sqrt(4 mc^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 mc^2 + k A^2 )

Wait, but 4 mc^2 +k A^2 is (2 mc^2 )^2 + (k A^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to check which option matches our expression.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²) )) 

Wait, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²) )

No, because that would be 1 + (2 mc^2)/(2 mc^2 -k A^2 ), which I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps let me compute the denominator (1 + a ) in our expression.

Wait, our expression for v is:

v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 +a )

We can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

So,

v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ] ) / (1 +a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 +a )

Let me square both sides to get v^2:

v² = c² * [ a (2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

Which is the same as earlier.

Now, looking at the options, let me see which one matches this expression.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² ) )^2 )

Let me see.

Let me compute the term inside the square root.

1 - 1/(1 + b )^2, where b = kA²/(2 mc² )

Which is 1 - 1/(1 + b )² = [ (1 +b )² -1 ]/(1 +b )² = [1 + 2b +b² -1 ]/(1 +b )² = (2b +b² )/(1 +b )².

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (2b +b² )/(1 +b )² )

= c * sqrt( b (2 + b ) ) / (1 + b )

Which is exactly what our expression is, with b = (k A²)/(2 mc^2 )

So, that would make option D the correct one. Because when I compute 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2 and take the square root multiplied by c, it gives our expression.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Our earlier expression for v² is c^2 (a(2+a))/(1+a)^2.

Which equals c² [ ( a (2+a) ) / (1+a )² ].

Which is the same as c^2 [ ( a (2 +a ) ) ] / (1 +a )^2.

Which is the same as c^2 [ ( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )^2 ].

And option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² ))^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2b +b^2) / (1 +b )^2 ), where b = (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So, that would be sqrt( b (2 + b ) / (1 +b )^2 ) ) = sqrt( [ b (2 +b ) ] ) / (1 +b )

Which is what we have for v/c.

So, option D is v = c * sqrt( [ b (2 + b ) ] ) / (1 +b ) )

Which matches our expression.

Wait, but our expression is v = c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ] ) / (1 +a ), where a = (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So, yes, this is exactly what option D is.

Wait, let me read option D again:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc^2) )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( ( 2b + b² )/(1 +b )^2 )

So, v = c * sqrt( (2b +b² )/(1 +b )^2 )

= c * sqrt( b(2 +b ) ) / (1 +b )

Which is the same as our expression.

So, option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 mc^2) ) )

Wait, 1 + 1/(1-x) is (x/(1-x)) +1, not sure. Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 -x) = (1 -x +1 )/(1 -x ) = (2 -x)/(1 -x ).

Which doesn't match our expression.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m) ))^2 )

Hmm, that's probably not.

Option C is non-relativistic.

So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we start by considering energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. In the relativistic regime, the total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\gamma = 1 + a.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2} = \frac{(1 + a)^2 - 1}{(1 + a)^2} = \frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2 = c^2 \cdot \frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}} = c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a(2 + a)}}{1 + a}.
\]

Substitute \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression in **Option D**. The other options do not align with the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \). 

**Answer: D**
