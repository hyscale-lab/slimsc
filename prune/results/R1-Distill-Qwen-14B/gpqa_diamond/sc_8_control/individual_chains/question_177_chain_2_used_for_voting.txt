Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, interesting. So both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger for Star_1.

Then, the problem mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength? Oh right, that's probably referring to the peak emission wavelength due to blackbody radiation. So, both stars emit most intensely at the same wavelength. 

I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the effective temperature. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T changes, lambda_max changes. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the stars have different radii and masses. But same temperature. Interesting. So, their luminosities must be different because luminosity depends on radius and temperature.

The question says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So what's the formula for luminosity of a star as a blackbody?

Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. Since both are blackbodies, this formula applies.

So the problem is comparing L1 and L2. Let me write that out.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

But from the given, R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (since lambda_max is same, so T same).

So substituting R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2 into L1 and L2:

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T²
L2 = 4π R2² σ T²

So the ratio L1/L2 is [ (1.5)^2 R2² σ T² ] / [ R2² σ T² ].

Wait, the 4π and σ and T² and R2² terms cancel out. So it's (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the correct answer because the options have some other numbers. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So why is the question giving options beyond 2.25? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does this affect the problem?

Hmm, I think radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh wait, this might be about the Doppler shift affecting the observed peak wavelength.

Wait, but earlier I assumed the peak wavelengths are the same because the problem stated that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted.

Wait, so maybe the actual peak wavelengths (emitted) are different because of their velocities, but when observed, they appear the same. Oh, that's a twist I didn't think of.

So, perhaps Star_1 and Star_2 have different intrinsic temperatures because of their velocities, but the observed lambda_max is the same. So I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me think. The peak wavelength emitted by each star (lambda_emit) is given by Wien's law, which is based on their actual temperature. But due to the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is shifted.

For Star_1, which has radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s, there's no Doppler shift. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s. If it's moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). The Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed lambda_obs is longer than lambda_emit. But the problem states that lambda_obs for both stars is the same. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

So, lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs1, because v1 is zero. And lambda_emit2 is shorter than lambda_obs2 because it's moving away (redshifted). But wait, wait. Wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed. So lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) ) )

So, the emitted lambda for Star_2 is shorter than the observed. But the observed lambdas are the same for both stars.

So, for Star_1: lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs.

For Star_2: lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

But wait, wait. Alternatively, for recessional velocity, the formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) where v is positive for moving away. But that's a linear approximation, perhaps. But for higher velocities, the relativistic formula is better.

Wait, let me think again. The Doppler shift when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. The exact formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Where v is the radial velocity, positive if moving away.

So for Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute that velocity relative to the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.00233c. So v/c is about 0.00233, which is small, but let's see.

So for Star_2:

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 (since v1=0). And the problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

So:

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2

So, substituting, we get:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which simplifies to:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So, T1 is less than T2, because the velocity is positive (moving away), so (1 - v/c) is less than (1 + v/c), so the ratio is less than 1, and the square root makes it even smaller.

Wait, so that would imply that T1 is lower than T2. Because Star_2 is moving away, so when we observe its peak wavelength, it's longer, which would suggest a lower temperature. But because the observed lambda is the same as Star_1, which has no velocity, Star_1 must have a higher temperature.

Wait, but then the luminosity ratio would be different because T is different.

So the previous assumption that T1 equals T2 was incorrect. I need to reevaluate.

So, let's recap:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Given that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, so lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Expressed in terms of temperatures, since lambda_emit = b / T:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

So T1 is lower than T2 because the velocity is away from us, which makes the observed lambda longer, so the emitted lambda is shorter, implying higher temperature. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) (assuming v is much less than c). So the emitted wavelength is shorter. Because if you're moving away, the light you emit is redshifted when observed. So, when we see the same observed lambda for both stars, Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter, meaning higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, that's a critical point. Let me recheck.

If Star_2 is moving away, we observe a longer wavelength. So, if it emits a wavelength lambda_emit, but because it's moving away, we see lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c). So lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c).

But we know that for Star_1, lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs, since v1 is zero. So lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But emitted wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda_emit = b / T. So,

lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2

So,

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

Because lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 / (1 + v2/c)

Which equals:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T1 is lower than T2.

Wait, because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so T1 is smaller.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So, T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c).

Hmm, but since v2 is positive, (1 + v2/c) is > 1, so T2 > T1.

So, now the luminosity of each star is:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

We can write L1/L2 as (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c). Let me compute T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2/c)^4 ]

Now, we need to compute (1 + v2/c). Let's compute v2/c.

v2 is 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

So v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333...

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333...

So, (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4.

Compute that.

We can approximate (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² for small x.

x = 0.002333.

n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2

Compute:

First term: 1

Second term: 0.009332

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2.

(0.002333)^2 is approx (2.333e-3)^2 = approx 5.444e-6.

Multiply by 6: 3.266e-5.

So total approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003266 ≈ 1.009365.

But wait, maybe we can be more precise.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

(1.002333)^2 = 1.00467 approx. Then square that.

1.00467^2 = approx 1.00936.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So, 1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.991.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because in L1/L2, it's 2.25 * [1/(1.00936)]^2.

Wait, no, wait, no.

Wait, earlier, I have:

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * [ (T1/T2) ]^4.

Wait, [ (T1/T2) ]^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4.

So, the factor is 2.25 * [1/(1.00936)].

Wait, no, let me compute [1/(1.00936)].

Wait, 1/1.00936 ≈ 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, 1/(1.00936) is about 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. 

But wait, 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.25*(0.99 + 0.0007) = 2.2275 + 0.001575 = approx 2.229.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute (1.002333)^4 accurately.

Let me compute step by step.

x = 0.002333

So, starting with 1.002333.

Compute its square:

(1.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + (approx 5.444e-6)

≈ 1.004666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square this again.

(1.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + (approx 2.182e-5).

≈ 1.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So, 1/(1.0093647) ≈ 0.99071.

So, the factor [1/(1.0093647)] is approximately 0.99071.

So, 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99071.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00071 = approximately 0.0015975.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.0015975 ≈ 2.2291.

So about 2.229, approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

But wait, let me check if I did the calculation correctly.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2=2.25.

T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) → (T1/T2)=1/(1 + v2/c).

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/( (1 + v2/c)^4 ) → 1/(1.0093647) ≈ 0.99071.

Multiply 2.25 * 0.99071 → 2.229.

So around 2.23.

So the correct answer should be option D) ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity and account for the Doppler shift due to the radial velocities of the stars.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   The luminosity of a star radiating as a blackbody is given by:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the effective temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

3. **Doppler Shift**:
   The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \), we can equate the emitted wavelengths:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]
   Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \)), this implies:
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   The luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}} \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}\right)^4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}, \, c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - \( v_2 / c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \)
   - \( 1 + v_2/c = 1.002333 \)
   - \( (1 + v_2/c)^4 \approx 1.00936 \)
   - \( 1 / (1 + v_2/c)^4 \approx 0.99071 \)

   Substituting:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99071 \approx 2.229
   \]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
