Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and they've given some parameters. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are all different concentrations, so I need to find out which one is correct.

Wait, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

The formula for the formation of the complex is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in solution, the concentration of free EDTA^4- might be low because most of it is tied up in the complex. So when you have a solution that's 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, does that mean the concentration of free Ca²+ is really low?

I think that when the complex is formed, the concentration of the complex itself is the sum of the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- multiplied by Kf. But wait, no. Let me think again.

The problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So that's the total concentration of the complex, assuming that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. No, wait, no. Wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that just means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex dissociates, there will be some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution.

Wait, but in reality, the Kf is so large (5e10) that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation of the complex would be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So perhaps I can model this using the formation constant. Let me set up the problem.

Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let’s say that the dissociation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces some Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. So then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well, because each complex produces one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait, because the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, which is already a complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. As it dissociates, some x M of each form.

So then, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is likely very small because Kf is large).

Therefore, the Kf expression becomes:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2)/(5e12) = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6. So 2e-6, but wait 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root of that would be sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)= 1e-6.5? Wait, no. Because 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Hmm, perhaps a better way: 1e-13 = (1e-6.5)^2, but 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it accurately.

4e-13 =4 * 1e-13.

The square root is sqrt(4)=2; sqrt(1e-13)= 1e-6.5.

So 1e-6.5 is same as 10^(-6.5) = 3.1623 *10^-7.

Thus, 2 * 3.1623e-7 = 6.3246e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the setup. The formation constant is given as K_Ca-EDTA =5e10. Wait, but the formation constant is Kf, which is the same as K_Ca-EDTA. So yes, that part is correct.

Another way to think about it: because the formation constant is very large, the complex is almost completely formed, so the concentration of free ions is very low.

Yes, this makes sense. So the correct answer is option C: 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \(K_f\), the concentration of the complex remains approximately \(0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:
