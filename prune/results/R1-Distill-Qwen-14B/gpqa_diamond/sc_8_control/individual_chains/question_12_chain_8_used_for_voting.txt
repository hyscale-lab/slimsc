Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) as 139.6 MeV and mu(+) as 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies. Hmm.

Alright, so I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to sum back to zero. That part makes sense.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. They have very little mass, right? I think they're considered massless in these kinds of problems. So for the neutrino, its energy would be equal to its momentum because E = pc when mass is negligible.

So, the muon and neutrino must share the pion's rest energy. But wait, the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. So the remaining energy must go into the kinetic energy of the muon and the energy of the neutrino.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. But the muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible.

So energy equation: E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino.

But E_pion is 139.6 MeV. E_muon is m_mu*c² + K_mu, and E_neutrino is K_nu. So,

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu.

So that gives K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Hmm, but that's the sum. Now, the problem is how to find each individually. I think we need to use momentum conservation as well.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and since the neutrino's momentum is opposite, its magnitude is also p.

So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, in units where c=1 (as is often done in particle physics), E = sqrt(p² + m² ). So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu² ), and E_nu = p, since for neutrino m_nu is zero.

So, the energies are related by E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu² ), E_nu = p. And from energy conservation, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

So substituting E_nu as p, we get:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that's a bit of an equation to solve. Let me write it down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

So,

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p + p².

Wait, the p² terms on both sides cancel out.

So,

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p.

Compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6^2 is approximately: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

139.6 * 139.6: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, but wait, wait. 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2.

140² is 19600. 2*140*0.4 is 112. (0.4)^2 is 0.16.

So 19600 - 112 = 19488, plus 0.16: 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: Let's see.

105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7 = 147.

So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So now, substituting into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging to solve for p:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: let's subtract.

19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16. Then minus 172.49: 8488.16 -172.49.

8488.16 - 172 = 8316.16. Then minus 0.49: 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit larger than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 -279.2= 8096.8.

Wait, 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. So 279.2 goes into 218.87 about 0.78 times (because 279.2 *0.78 ≈ 217). So total p is approximately 29.78.

Wait, perhaps I should do a better division.

Alternatively, 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, so E_nu is p, which is about 29.78 MeV.

And E_mu is sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu^2 is 105.7^2 = 11172.49 (MeV)^2.

p² is (29.78)^2 = Let's compute that.

29.78 squared: (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + (0.22)^2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.8484.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384).

What's sqrt(12059.3384)? Hmm, 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100.

12059.3384 is between 109^2 and 110^2.

Compute 109.8^2: 109^2 is 11881. 0.8^2 is 0.64. 2*109*0.8= 174.4. So 109.8^2 = (109 +0.8)^2 = 109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8² = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04.

Wait, that's close to 12059.3384. So 12059.3384 is about 109.8^2 plus some. Let's see:

12059.3384 - 12056.04 = 3.2984.

So 3.2984/(2*109.8) ≈ 3.2984/(219.6) ≈ 0.015. So the square root is approximately 109.8 + 0.015 ≈ 109.815.

So E_mu ≈ 109.815 MeV.

But wait, the sum E_mu + E_nu should be 139.6.

So 109.815 + 29.78 = 139.595, which is close to 139.6. So that seems correct.

Now, the kinetic energies are K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 MeV approximately.

And K_nu is E_nu, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Another option is option B, which is 7.2 and 32.8. That's higher than what I got.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because perhaps I miscalculated the p.

Wait, earlier I had p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c, which makes E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV, and E_mu ≈109.815.

So, K_mu is about 4.115 MeV, and K_nu is 29.78.

So the option that matches is D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

But wait, looking at the options, option D has the KEs as 4.12 and 29.8, which are close to my approximate values.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the given reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \(E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)).

### Energy Conservation
The total energy after the decay is:

\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
\]

where \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} + K_{\mu}\) (rest energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy) and \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\) (kinetic energy of the neutrino, as its rest mass is negligible). Substituting:

\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta (\(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p\)). Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the muon:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]

and for the neutrino (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)):

\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

Substituting into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Squaring both sides:

\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:

\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]

Solving for \(p\):

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

Thus, \(E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating \(E_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\mu}\)
Using \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\):

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the muon is:

\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Results
The kinetic energies are approximately:

\[
K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Matching with Options
The closest match is **Option D**: \(K_{\mu} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), \(K_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).
