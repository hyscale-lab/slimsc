Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule. So, the main chain seems to be a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbaldehyde group. Wait, maybe I should think about how to build this from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached.

So, the target has a cyclohexyl group, hydroxymethyl, and an aldehyde. Let me think about the steps involved. I remember that ethynyl groups can be functionalized in various ways. Maybe the triple bond is going to be converted into something else.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, (CH3)2S, and NH4OH. These seem like typical reagents for deprotonation, alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, ozonolysis, and so on.

Let me think about the synthesis steps. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. One approach with alkynes is to perform an alkyne alkylation or perhaps a hydration. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the possible transformations.

The target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. How do I introduce that? Maybe through some kind of addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a result of a Grignard reaction or another nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, looking at the options, some reagents involve NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in alkyne chemistry. Methyl chloride might be for methylating something. Oh, perhaps it's used in a deprotonation followed by alkylation, like forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, maybe we need to do a hydration. But wait, the target has a carbaldehyde group. Oh, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. Hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. But in this case, perhaps we can form an aldehyde.

Wait, no. Let me think. Hydration of an alkyne can be done in two ways: acid-catalyzed hydration gives a ketone (since it adds water across the triple bond to form a carbonyl), or perhaps with some specific conditions, like using a different catalyst, could give an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some other process.

Alternatively, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol, which can then be oxidized. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into some diol, which could then be oxidized or modified.

Wait, let's think about each step. Option A has NaNH2 and methyl chloride first. NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps it's deprotonating something. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated to form an alkyne anion, which then reacts with methyl chloride as an alkylating agent. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has the structure cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal alkyne (CH) would give a cyclohexane-C≡C^- which would attack methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? But wait, that would be a butynyl group. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2Cyclohexane-C≡CH. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, so it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. Wait, the ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent: -C≡CH. So the molecule is CH2-Cyclohexyl-C≡CH? No, wait, it's cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. So it's cyclohexane attached to a CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent directly? Actually, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane connected to a -C≡CH group.

So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what each reagent does.

The first option starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating the alkyne. The alkyne is acidic (pKa around 25), so in presence of a strong base like NaNH2, it deprotonates to form an alkyne anion.

Then, methyl chloride would act as an alkylating agent. So the alkyne anion (which is a strong base) would react with methyl chloride to form a new carbon-carbon bond. So cyclohexane-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl^– + ...? Wait, wait, perhaps it's more like CH3Cl would provide a methyl group. So perhaps the alkyne would be extended.

Wait, wait, the alkyne is -C≡CH. Deprotonating gives -C≡C^–. Then, adding methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, so perhaps the alkyne would be extended to -C≡C-CH2Cl. But that wouldn't make sense because methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which would give a methyl group. So maybe it forms cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, with a methyl group added. Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

Wait, this isn't clear. Let me think about another approach. Let's look at the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and then an aldehyde group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me try to parse the name. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane. Then, the substituent at position 1 is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, it's something like cyclohexane-CHO with a substituent at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). So, the carbon at position 1 of the cyclohexane has two substituents: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and the aldehyde is at position 1 as well? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the target is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methylcyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a methyl group attached, which is substituted with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group, and also an aldehyde.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to figure out the steps to get there from ethynylcyclohexane.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is our starting material. Let's think about the steps:

1. Maybe we need to perform a deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group or another substituent.

Wait, looking at the options again, several reagent sequences involve NaNH2 and an alkyl chloride. For example, options A, B, C, and D all have the first step as NaNH2 and something. So, the first step is likely deprotonation of the alkyne to form an alkyne anion, followed by alkylation with a methyl or ethyl group.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) is treated with NaNH2, which deprotonates to form cyclohexane-C≡C^-.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate this to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group, making a longer alkyne? Or perhaps it's adding a methyl group to the alkyne anion.

Wait, but wait: after deprotonation, adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a longer chain.

But perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the target: it has a hydroxymethyl group attached somewhere. So maybe we need to introduce an alcohol group.

Looking at the reagents, some steps involve O3 (ozone) and then work-up. Ozonolysis is typically for cleaving alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, but our starting material is an alkyne. Maybe after some steps, we form a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

Another possibility is that the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. For example, using H2 and a catalyst like Pd (hydrogenation). Then, that alkene could undergo ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine the steps:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with a base (like NaNH2) and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form an anion, then methylate it. That gives a longer alkyne, maybe 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne.

Step 2: Maybe hydrogenate that alkyne to cis or trans alkene. So, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, the alkyne is now a single bond with a methyl group attached. Wait, maybe the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, making a cis or trans double bond: cyclohexane-C=CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation, which would add H2 across the triple bond, making a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, but then, step 3 in some options is O3, which would cleave the double bond. So, ozonolysis of the alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So, putting it together:

- Start with ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

- Step 1: Deprotonate with NaNH2, methylate with CH3Cl to get cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

- Step 2: Hydrogenate with H2 and Pd to make cyclohexane-C=CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait. The hydrogenation of an alkyne (like ethyne) with H2 and Pd gives an alkane. Wait, no, wait. Hydrogenation of an alkyne under hydrogen with a catalyst like Lindlar's gives cis alkene, while using a poisoned catalyst like Na or Li in NH3 gives trans. Alternatively, without a catalyst, perhaps it just stops at the alkene.

Wait, but in any case, hydrogenation of the alkyne would give an alkene.

So, after step 2, the triple bond becomes a double bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps hydrogenation of the alkyne would not add enough H2. Wait, ethyne (triple bond) hydrogenated over Pd would become ethane. So, for 1-alkyne, adding two H2 would give an alkane.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think: The hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically add two H2 molecules, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no: The alkyne is R-C≡C-R', hydrogenation (with H2 and Pd) would add two H's across each triple bond, so the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added. So, R-CH2-CH2-R'. So, in this case, the alkyne after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a straight chain. So, after hydrogenation, we have a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group attached?

Wait, but looking at the target molecule again, that doesn't seem to fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl and aldehyde group. Maybe the synthesis involves forming a ketone or aldehyde through oxidation, then introducing the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone via hydration. But then, how to get the aldehyde? Probably not, as hydration typically gives a ketone when starting from an alkyne.

Wait, but another possibility is that the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxymercuration or similar. But that's more for alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a carbonyl via ozonolysis. But wait, ozonolysis is for alkenes. So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysed.

Wait, let's think. If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in our case, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, hydrogenation would give cis-1-cyclohexylethylene? So, cyclohexane attached to a CH2-CH2 group. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. Let me try to write the structure.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Breaking this down, it's a cyclohexane ring (let's say position 1) with a substituent. The substituent is a group that has a cyclohexyl, a hydroxy, and a methyl. So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl group? So, the substituent is CH2CH2-cyclohexyl-OH? No, wait.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2CHO group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a central carbon, which also has a hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group. This methyl group is attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

Wait, but the aldehyde is also attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the main ring has both a substituent at position 1 (a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group) and a carbaldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the aldehyde is at the same position.

I'm not entirely clear on the structure, but perhaps I can think about the steps regardless.

Looking back at the options, let's consider each one.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Hmm, so after step 1, we'd have a methylated alkyne. Step 2, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 is for elimination, perhaps forming an alkene. Then, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O is for oxidation, maybe Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions. So, if after hydrogenation, we have a certain structure, Ba(OH)2 might induce elimination to form a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the steps.

Another approach: Let's think about the target molecule. It has a hydroxyl group on a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps a substitution reaction would introduce that.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves forming a diketone, which is then subjected to some kind of elimination or condensation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone. How? Maybe via hydration to a ketone, then oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, which can then undergo some reactions.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about each option.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: deprotonate with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, alkyne becomes longer. Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for Birch reductions or eliminations. Then, ozonolysis, then NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent, maybe for reductive work-up?).

Alternatively, Li in liquid NH3 can induce deprotonation or elimination. Wait, but after step 1, the alkyne has been extended with an ethyl group. Then, step 2 could be some elimination, perhaps forming a diene or another triple bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds into carbonyls.

But I'm not sure.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, step 1: methylate the alkyne. Step 2: hydrogenate using H2 and Pd-CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Then, ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up (unlike H2O which is oxidative). Then, Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base for elimination or saponification.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: deprotonate with NaNH2, then methylate with methanol? Wait, methanol as an electrophile? That would produce a methyl ether? Or perhaps it's a quench with methanol. Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction.

Wait, after deprotonating the alkyne, using methanol would provide a methyl group via alkylation. So, the alkyne would become O-Me or something else.

Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Let me approach this by considering the possible steps needed to reach the target.

The target has an aldehyde group. How do we get that from an alkyne? Maybe through oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps via a ketone followed by a reduction, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted to an aldehyde via a series of steps. For example, the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl via hydration, then another step.

Wait, but that would give a ketone, not an aldehyde. Unless it's a terminal alkyne that becomes an aldehyde. Wait, but in the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, the alkyne is not terminal. It's cyclohexane attached to C≡CH.

Wait, perhaps if the alkyne is deprotonated and then reacts with a methyl group, making a longer chain, then hydrogenated, then ozonized, and then some work-up.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents. So, perhaps a cyclohexane is being functionalized at two positions: one with the aldehyde, and another with the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to consider each reagent's role.

In the target molecule, the presence of a hydroxymethyl group suggests that some kind of addition of water or OH- has happened. Alternatively, perhaps an epoxide ring opening or a Grignard addition.

Wait, the presence of Ba(OH)2 suggests a possibility of elimination (like forming an epoxide or removing a group) or saponification if an ester is present. But I'm not sure.

Looking at option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne extended to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, now the structure is cyclohexane with a propyl group attached.

Wait, but then step 3 is O3/ (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of any double bonds. But after hydrogenation, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds. So that doesn't make sense. Wait, unless step 2 wasn't a full hydrogenation but only partial.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenolysis, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation, making a larger alkyne. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis-alkene. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyls. Let's see.

So, after step 1, alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd → hydrogenation of alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, now it's a straight chain with three carbons attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but if it's R-CH2-CH2-CH3, then ozonolysis would not do anything since there's no double bond.

Hmm, that's not working. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene, but then step 3 is ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, let's try that:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2, CH3Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's a single bond, no double bond. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a different catalyst that stops at the alkene. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst would give a cis-alkene. So, after step 2, we have a cis-alkene.

Then, step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the cis-alkene into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the molecule after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. So, no double bond; so ozonolysis can't happen.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Let me think about another approach. The target has an aldehyde. Maybe the final step is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking back to the options, some options have a step with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones oxidation. Others have NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. Alternatively, some have O3 followed by (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, so it would form aldehydes instead of carboxylic acids.

So, in option C, step 3 is O3/ (CH3)2S, which would form carbonyl groups without further oxidation. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have a dialdehyde or a ketone and an aldehyde, and then the hydroxymethyl comes from another step.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for elimination, forming a double bond or an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the Ba(OH)2 is for creating a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the synthesis involves forming a hemiacetal or some other functional group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Dealkylation and alkylation to add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. Work-up to form aldehydes.

But I'm not matching this to any of the options exactly.

Wait, looking at option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → Hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/ (CH3)2S → But since no double bond, nothing happens.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps quenched with methanol, giving R-C≡C-OCH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with methanol to form an ether.

But I'm not certain.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option D:

After step 1: NaNH2, methanol → Alkyne becomes something (maybe an ether? Or perhaps methanol is acting as an acid quench? Not sure.)

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → This is a strong base, used for Birch reductions, eliminations, etc.

Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → Work-up with ammonium hydroxide.

Hmm, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But I'm not exactly sure.

Another approach: Maybe the correct sequence involves forming a ketone, then performing some kind of oxidation or addition to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for forming an epoxide or a carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be for elimination, creating a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated (step 1).

2. Alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (step 2).

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form two carbonyl groups (step 3).

4. Work-up to form aldehydes, and then some base treatment to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not matching this to any option yet.

Wait, looking at option C:

Step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If, after ozonolysis, we have some carbonyl groups, perhaps Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination or some kind of condensation.

Wait, maybe after ozonolysis, we have a diketone, and Ba(OH)2 would cause a pinacol-like rearrangement to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target requires the formation of a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group through some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Dealkylation and alkylation to add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave into two aldehyde groups.

4. Then, some treatment to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → Perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated and then reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether. So, R-C≡OCH3.

But I'm not sure about that.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → Could be a Birch reduction, but that reduces aromatic rings, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, it could be used to deprotonate something else.

3. O3/ (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, then reductive work-up to form aldehydes.

4. NH4OH → Which is a mild base, perhaps to hydrolyze something.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne, methylate to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyls.

4. Work-up to form aldehyde groups.

But then, how to introduce the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the target is synthesized via Grignard addition. Let's think: Maybe after forming a carbonyl via ozonolysis, a Grignard reagent would add to it, introducing a new carbon group.

But that depends on the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a benzyl group, then undergoes some reactions to form the required substituents.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about each option's sequence.

Option C's steps after the first two:

After step 1 and 2, the molecule would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a straight chain. Then ozonolysis wouldn't break anything. So, option C is probably incorrect.

Option A: After step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is more commonly used for elimination or saponification. Hmm.

Option B: After step 2, Li in liquid NH3. Perhaps this is a Birch reduction, but I don't think that applies here.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this produces a methyl ester or ether. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, possibly leading to elimination.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne and alkylate with methyl chloride to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two aldehyde groups.

4. Then, perform a Grignard addition to introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxymethyl.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the substituent. So perhaps the Grignard reagent is a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide, which would add to a carbonyl group, forming the cyclohexyl substituent.

So, after ozonolysis, we have two aldehyde groups. Then, adding a Grignard reagent would add a cyclohexyl group to one of them, and perhaps the other aldehyde would be modified into a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure how that would exactly proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break into two carbonyls.

4. Reduction of one carbonyl to a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Looking at the options again, option C's fourth step is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S (a reductive work-up) would give aldehydes. Then, Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination or perhaps some kind of oxidation.

Wait, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for the elimination of a water molecule, forming a double bond, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think through that.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → Hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → But after step 2, no double bonds, so ozonolysis does nothing. So, this can't be correct.

Hmm.

Option B:

After step 1: Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps deprotonates something to form a strong base.

Step 3: O3/H2O → cleaves any double bonds, but after step 2, we don't have any. Unless step 2 introduces a double bond.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be used for elimination, creating a double bond.

Wait, after step 1, the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3, which is a strong base, could cause elimination. For example, if we have a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. But in this case, we have an alkyne. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis, which would only act on double bonds. So, if step 2 creates a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see where the halogen would come from.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse this IUPAC name.

The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, the substituent is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

Wait, so the substituent is a CH group attached to the cyclohexane ring, which has an OH group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, but that's not possible because the substituents can't be on the same carbon. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has two substituents: a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is:

cyclohexane
|
CHO

and at the same carbon (position 1), a CH2 group that is connected to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps it's:

cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached at position 1. That CH2 group is connected to OH and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and also has a CHO group.

Wait, but then that's two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible but rare unless it's a geminal di-substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group (making it a hydroxymethyl group) and a cyclohexyl group. And the aldehyde group is perhaps on the same carbon, making it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO.

But I'm not sure. Regardless, the main point is that the synthesis must introduce both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl groups.

Now, considering that, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2, then methylate to form R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene (R-CH2-CH2-CH3?), then perhaps dehydrogenate to form a diol.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkyne is extended and hydrogenated, we can perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is extended to R-C≡C-CH2CH3, then hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is then oxidized to form a diketone. But I don't see reagents for oxidation in any of the initial steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/ (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in some elimination or saponification, but I don't see how that would help.

So, perhaps this is incorrect.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated and then reacts with methanol to form an ether, R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction, but without an aromatic ring, I don't think that's applicable.

3. O3/ (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but no double bond.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again, but why?

3. O3/ H2O → cleaves any double bonds, but after step 2, if we have a triple bond, no double bond, so ozonolysis can't act.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible final steps.

The target has an aldehyde group, which could come from ozonolysis of a double bond followed by reductive work-up. But then, how does the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group get added?

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for elimination, creating a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Then, introducing the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups via Grignard or another addition.

But I'm not seeing how the steps in any option match this.

Another angle: Let's think about the possible reagents and their functions.

NaNH2 is used for deprotonating alkynes to form anions, which can then alkylate. So step 1 in all options is likely forming a longer alkyne.

Then, step 2: some options hydrogenate the alkyne. Others may do elimination.

If step 2 is hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes an alkane, which doesn't have any functional groups. But that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which can then be ozonolyzed.

Wait, but in that case, the step 2 would need to stop at the alkene, perhaps using a poisoned catalyst.

Let me think about option C:

Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. I think Pd with CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation, which would add hydrogen to the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, after step 2, it's R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would do nothing as there's no double bond. So, this can't be the correct path.

Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-OCH3 (maybe an ether formation).

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → Perhaps elimination, but not sure.

Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis on any double bonds, but after step 2, perhaps a double bond was formed.

Wait, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would act on it.

So, perhaps step 2 is deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene.

But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence should involve:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form two aldehyde groups.

4. Introduction of the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups via some addition.

Looking at the options, option C does not have ozonolysis followed by a work-up that would form aldehydes. It has O3/ (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, leading to aldehydes.

Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which could then be used in a subsequent step. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2 is used to create the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: Ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause a pinacol-like rearrangement, forming a new carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the steps:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → after step 1, becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

- Step 2: hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

- Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S → no double bonds, so nothing happens. So option C is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate alkyne, then react with methanol to form an ether: R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S → if there's a double bond, ozonolysis would occur.

But I'm not seeing how this would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I have, I think I'll have to make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group and a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, likely forming a straight-chain alkane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or saponification.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, typically for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced or how the aldehyde is formed.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, possibly for reductive work-up.

This sequence lacks clarity on how the aldehyde is formed or how the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, likely forming a straight-chain alkane.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up, which forms aldehydes from double bonds.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or saponification.

After step 2, the molecule lacks double bonds, so ozonolysis in step 3 would not proceed. This makes the sequence inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and reacts with methanol, possibly forming an ether or quenching the alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up, forming aldehydes from double bonds.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, possibly for reductive work-up.

This sequence also lacks clarity on how the aldehyde is formed or how the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reagents must involve forming a longer alkyne, introducing a double bond, and then using ozonolysis to form aldehydes. However, none of the options clearly align with the target molecule's structure and the required transformations. Based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it includes ozonolysis with a reductive work-up, which could form aldehydes, but the sequence is incomplete.

**Answer: C**
