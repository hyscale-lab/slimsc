Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe like a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe that's when it's with water. Or wait, another possibility: when you have a compound like an ester reacting with HI, you might get an elimination. Or maybe it's about the formation of an acid from an ester. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

First, let's try to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data should help. So, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe from a carbonyl group or an alcohol. Wait, no, O-H in alcohols is usually broader and around 3300-3500. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid because the peak is sharp, but I'm not sure. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very high chemical shift, which often suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid, but the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the 1H NMR, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around there. But in this case, it's a singlet, which might suggest it's an aldehyde because carboxylic acids usually have broad signals and maybe more splitting? Or perhaps it's an amide? Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is more likely an ester or ketone or aldehyde. Let me think. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but sometimes lower. The 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone, but in this case, the NMR might help more.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet. So let's consider an aldehyde. If that's the case, then the aldehyde proton is around 9-10.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but the aldehyde seems more likely. But let's look at the rest of the NMR.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two sets of doublets. So, the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but each as a doublet, so perhaps each substituent is a group that doesn't have neighboring protons, but in this case, it's para. So the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions.

Then we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet integrating for 1H. Hmm, maybe a CH adjacent to something else. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of 3H, which is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or CH. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group.

So putting this together, let's try to draw the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is an aldehyde group because of the 10.5 ppm peak. But wait, wait, an aldehyde group would require a CH where the aldehyde is attached directly to the benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then the proton would be elsewhere. Hmm, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, so no splitting, which is consistent with an aldehyde (RCHO) as the aldehyde proton is typically a singlet because there's no adjacent protons.

Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde, then the benzene would have -CHO in one para position. What's the other substituent? The other peaks in the NMR are for the rest of the structure. So, perhaps the other substituent is a substituent chain.

Wait, the other substituent could be something like a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let's see: the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH connected to that CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps like a CH(CH3) group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the end of an ethyl chain. So putting that together, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, let me try to build this. Let's say the benzene ring is in para positions with a CHO group (the aldehyde) and another substituent. The other substituent is perhaps a CH2CH2 group but more likely a branched chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group attached in some way. Let me think. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's a terminal CH2CH2... Wait, no, a triplet for 3H is usually a CH3 in an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. So the 0.9 ppm is probably the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group.

Looking at the other peaks: 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH, which is next to a branch. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH that's adjacent to two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a CHO group in one para position and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the other. Wait, but how would that connect?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH2) group that's branched. Let me try to sketch this:

The benzene has a CHO group on one carbon and another group on the opposite carbon. The other group is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but let's count the protons.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) must be a methyl group attached to a CH. So, for example, if there's a CH(CH3) group, then the CH also has another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group connected to the benzene.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but how? The substituent could be a isobutyl group or a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), so that would be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2 or something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2 group where the middle CH2 is attached to another CH(CH3), which is connected to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. So, maybe it's a CH2 between two CH groups.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch. Let me think of substituents. Let's see, if the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, that would give a certain pattern. Alternatively, it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me see.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which could be the CH in the middle. So, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- something? Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think of the substituent as CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the benzene? No, that would make the substituent longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me see. The substituent would then be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to the benzene. But then, how does that fit the NMR?

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene? No, because that would require more protons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group. Wait, no, the isopropyl group would have a CH(CH3)2 structure, and the NMR would show a septet for the CH(CH3)2 group, but here the 1.4 ppm is a triplet for 3H, so maybe not.

Wait, another approach: let's think about all the NMR signals. The benzene has two substituents, one is the aldehyde (CHO), and the other is a more complex group.

The substituent group: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group? Hmm, but that might be too long.

Wait, another way. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let's consider a structure where you have a central CH connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm). So, the substituent would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the benzene. But let me count the protons again.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is 1H, so that's the central CH. The CH would be connected to three groups: the benzene ring, a CH2 group, and a CH3 group (from 1.4 ppm). So, the structure would be CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, because that would make the substituent a pentyl group or something else. Hmm, perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me see: the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Then, the NMR would have the CH2 next to the benzene as 1.7 ppm (m, 2H?), the CH(CH2CH3) as 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the CH2CH3 as 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). But wait, the CH(CH2CH3) would have more than one proton, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Then, the CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (middle CH2) and the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm. That seems to fit. But wait, how many protons would each CH2 have?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me consider a structure where the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe it's a benzyl group attached to a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the group attached to the benzene is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let's see: the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (2H), the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H), and the terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H). The CH(CH2CH3) would have two neighboring CH2 groups, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. So, structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Then, the CH2 next to the benzene would be 1.7 ppm (2H), the CH would be 2.9 ppm (1H), and the CH2CH3 would be 0.9 ppm (3H). Then, what about the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Oh wait, that would be the methyl group attached to the CH. So, the CH is CH(CH3), which is attached to the CH2.

Wait, so substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe it's benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think of it as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 attached to the benzene. But that would make the substituent a bit longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups as 1.7 ppm (the middle CH2), the CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm. But wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl attached to the CH, so that fits.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene. But wait, that would make the substituent a butyl group? Or perhaps a pentyl group? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, which would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So, the 1.4 is a methyl attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2, which is attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be something like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a longer chain, but perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think. A sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting the terminology wrong. Wait, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Then, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But that would make the substituent a isopropyl group attached via a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). Then, the NMR would have:

- CH2 next to benzene (probably around 2.9 ppm?), no, wait. The 1.7 ppm is a CH2, 2.9 is the CH(CH3), 1.4 is the CH3 on the CH, and 0.9 is the terminal CH3 from the ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)1-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. So, the chain is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, that would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure if that's the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that would require a different NMR pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group. But then, the NMR would show a septet for the CH(CH3)2, but in this case, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which is more like a methyl attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2, then the benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options provided and see if any fit.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction is that? Oh! I think this is about the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester. No, wait, another possibility: the formation of an acid from an ester using HI and red phosphorus, which is the Oppenauer oxidation? No, wait, Oppenauer is for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Wait, no, that's the Stephen reduction. No, wait, the Stephen reduction uses phosphorus and an acid like HBr, but perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester.

Wait, perhaps I should first determine what Compound X is, and then figure out what reaction would produce the product.

So, let's go back to Compound X. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. But the IR of Compound X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl. Benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but as an acid, the O-H would be around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is a broad peak. The IR data includes 3400–2500 cm-1, which could indicate an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. So, if the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a carboxylic acid O-H, then the structure would be a benzoic acid with a substituent.

But wait, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet. Carboxylic acids usually show broad O-H signals, but sometimes in DMSO or other solvents, it can be a singlet. But in any case, in the NMR, the peak at 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid. Let me check the other signals.

If Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), then the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position. The substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the NMR would have peaks for the substituent. Let's see: the CH(CH3) would have a triplet for the CH2 attached to it, and the CH3 would be a triplet as well. Wait, no. Let me think about the structure.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the groups attached would be:

- The benzene is para substituted with the substituent.

The substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the CH2 would be next to the benzene, and the CH(CH3) would be next to that.

In NMR, the CH2 (attached to the benzene) would be a triplet or something else. Wait, but in the NMR data, we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 attached to the benzene. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a CH2 attached to it. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, that's an isoamyl group? No, perhaps a sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is: CH2-CH(CH2-CH3)-. No, wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is actually CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's only two carbons. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, no. Wait, the butyl group has four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. No, that's three carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: a butyl group is four carbons. So, a sec-butyl group would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's three carbons. Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, that can't be right because that's four carbons in total. Wait, maybe I should just draw it.

The substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 and a -CH2-CH(CH3) group in position 1 (para to the COOH). Wait, no, because the substituents are in para positions. So the benzoic acid would have the COOH in position 4, and the substituent in position 1 (assuming 1 and 4 are para).

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain where the branch is on the second carbon. So, it would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene? No, wait, that's a five-carbon group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-. Because butyl is four carbons: the first carbon is attached to the benzene, the second is a CH with a methyl group, and the third is a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would be a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but I'm not certain about the branching.

Wait, let's go back to the NMR of Compound X. The substituent's NMR signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

This suggests a chain structure where the CH group is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH2CH3.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. No, that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But then, the NMR would have the CH2 next to benzene at 1.7 ppm (2H), the CH at 2.9 ppm (1H), and the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (3H). But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come into play? Oh, wait, perhaps the CH(CH2CH3) has a CH3 attached to it, but that doesn't fit because the 1.4 is a d for 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would require the NMR to have more signals. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this part. Let me try to think differently. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position 1.

The sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's four carbons.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. No, that's four carbons but how? Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The sec-butyl group is where the substituent is on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's four carbons? No, CH2-CH(CH2CH3) would be three carbons, but the butyl group requires four. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another way: the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But then, the substituent would have a chain of four carbons: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in option C is a butyl group where the branch is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, not a butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR of option C. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the NMR would show peaks for the CH2, CH, and CH3 groups.

In the substituent, the CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet or a multiplet around 1.7 ppm. The CH group would be around 2.9 ppm, and the CH3 groups would be around 1.4 ppm (for the methyl attached to the CH) and 0.9 ppm (for the ethyl group's CH3).

Wait, that seems to match the NMR data. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have:

- CH2 (next to benzene): 1.7 ppm (2H)
- CH: 2.9 ppm (1H)
- CH(CH3): 1.4 ppm (3H, d)
- CH2CH3: 0.9 ppm (3H, t)

So, that fits perfectly with the NMR data. Therefore, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does this do?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to hydrolyze nitriles to amines, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, perhaps there's another reaction. Wait, wait a minute. Another possibility is that the benzoic acid is esterified, but if it's an acid, reacting with HI might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, but the initial analysis didn't point to that.

Wait, another thought: if Compound X is a nitrile, then upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus, it would undergo hydrolysis to form an amine. But the IR data doesn't show a nitrile peak (around 2200 cm-1), so that's probably not the case.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but in this case, if Compound X is a nitrile, the product would be a primary amine. But the IR of Compound X doesn't show a nitrile peak, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if Compound X is an ester, treatment with HI might lead to cleavage. But how?

Wait, another possibility: if Compound X is a benzyl chloride or another type of compound, but the data doesn't support that.

Wait, but in the given options, the product after reaction is one of the four. Let me think about each option.

The possible product is one of the four, so perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination.

Wait, the reaction is between Compound X and HI with red phosphorus. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but if Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent in Compound X is an ester group. Wait, let me think, if Compound X is an ester like benzene with an ester group and a substituent, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde group, and the reaction would reduce it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what is the reaction of red phosphorus with HI? It's a strong reducing agent. So, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction. For example, reducing a nitrile to an amine, or reducing a ketone to an alcohol, but without a clear direction.

Wait, going back: the IR of Compound X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.

If it's a benzoic acid (option C), the IR would have a peak around 1700 cm-1, which fits. The O-H stretch is broad in the IR (3400–2500 cm-1), which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.

So, if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Oppenauer oxidation, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but in this case, if it's already a carboxylic acid, nothing would happen.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group. For example, if the substituent is a ester like OCOCH2CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, but as I said earlier, there's no peak around 2200 cm-1 in the IR.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine, but I don't see nitrile peaks in the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group. If the substituent is a ketone, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which matches. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI could reduce the ketone to an alcohol. But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction is a saponification (hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid). If Compound X is an ester, then upon treatment with aqueous acid (like HI), it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But the options include a benzoic acid (option C), which would be the product if the starting material is an ester.

So, if Compound X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon hydrolysis with HI, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C. But that would mean that the product is the same as Compound X, which can't be right because the question says "the final product," implying a change.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent itself undergoes a reaction. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the benzoic acid group. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a bromide, and HI is causing a substitution. So, if the substituent is a benzyl bromide, treating with HI would cause an alkylation. But I don't think that's the case.

Let me think again. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Another possible reaction is the formation of an ylide. Wait, in the presence of HI, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the structure of Compound X. If it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the COOH is in the para position.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the phosphorus acts as a reducing agent. Wait, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, sometimes nitriles are reduced to amines. Alternatively, maybe the ester group is reduced, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the benzoic acid is being converted into benzaldehyde. But I don't know the exact reaction for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is being deoxygenated. For example, if the substituent were a nitrile, it would become an amine. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl group, so I'm not sure what reaction would occur.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the options. The options are A-D, and they are all substituted benzenes with either an acid group or an ethyl group.

If the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of an acid, then option C would make sense. But if X is already an acid, then maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can cause the formation of amines from nitriles. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But the options don't show amines, so that might not be the case.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, then the reaction with HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid, making option C the product.

But if X is already a carboxylic acid, then perhaps the reaction is unrelated to the substituent. Maybe the substituent is undergoing some reaction. For example, the sec-butyl group might be undergoing elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, perhaps the reaction is causing the formation of a more substituted alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the benzoic acid group is being converted into a benzyl group. But I don't know the exact mechanism for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of the substituent, but that would require the substituent to have an -OH group, which it doesn't.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI: another possibility is that they are used to eliminate a molecule, perhaps a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, the reaction could lead to an alkene. But in the NMR data, the substituent doesn't have any protons that would suggest a CH2CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. Then, the reaction could cause the elimination of H2O or HI, forming a double bond. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, then elimination would form a butene group.

But I'm not sure how this would fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydrogen is replaced by iodide. But that would require the substituent to have a good leaving group, which it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. So, the product would have an amine group. But looking at the options, none of them have amine groups. So, that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol. But again, the options don't show any alcohols.

Hmm. At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's Compound X, and the reaction is treatment with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps nothing happens because it's already a carboxylic acid. But that can't be the case because the question implies a reaction.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a nitrile. Let me think: if the substituent is a nitrile group, then the IR would show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which is not present. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group. So, if Compound X is an ester, like benzene with a COOR group and a substituent, then the reaction with HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be benzoic acid with the substituent.

But in the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product if the starting material was an ester.

But wait, the IR data of Compound X shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which fits an ester (around 1740 cm-1 for esters, but 1720 is close). The O-H stretch for the ester would be from an -OH group if it's in the NMR, but in this case, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if Compound X is an ester, like benzene with a COOR group, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which it does. The NMR would have a singlet around 10.5 ppm, but an ester typically doesn't have a proton in that region unless it's an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ester group, and the aldehyde is part of the substituent. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. So, the IR would have a peak at 1720 cm-1. The NMR would have a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde, but if it's a ketone, the aldehyde wouldn't be present.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider another approach. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. The substituent would be a ethyl group on the benzene, connected to a propanoic acid.

But the IR of Compound X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would be the carbonyl for the acid. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the O-H of the acid. The NMR would show the ethyl group as a triplet around 1.2 ppm and a quartet around 2.5 ppm, but in the given NMR, there's a 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) and a 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), which would fit an ethyl group attached to a CH2.

But option A's structure would have a substituent on the benzene that's ethyl, which doesn't match the substituent seen in the NMR.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with an isobutyl group and a methyl group in para positions. But the NMR doesn't show a methyl group attached to the benzene (the substituent would be a isobutyl and a methyl), but the given NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions. The substituent would be a sec-butyl and a methyl, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit a purely alkyl-substituted benzene.

So, the only option that includes a carbonyl group is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid). So, if Compound X is option C, then what's the product when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the benzoic acid is being converted into benzaldehyde. But I don't know the exact reaction for that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is being modified.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the benzoic acid to form benzene with a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is being brominated or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. But that would require a reducing agent, and red phosphorus with HI might not do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is undergoing some elimination. For example, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, maybe it's being converted into a more branched structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, and the reaction is causing the loss of a water molecule, forming a double bond. So, the substituent would become CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is being oxidized or reduced. But I'm not familiar with the exact reaction pathway here.

Wait, given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent, but maybe I'm missing something.

But the reaction is supposed to change the compound. So, perhaps the reaction is causing the ester (if present) to become a carboxylic acid. But if the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, that can't be. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying Compound X. Let me think again. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde proton. If that's the case, then the substituent is an aldehyde group.

So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with a substituent. But wait, the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which could be from an aldehyde (around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1. So, in that case, Compound X would be an aldehyde.

So, if the substituent is a benzaldehyde group, and another substituent, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could cause a reduction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of nitriles to amines, but if you have an aldehyde, perhaps it's reduced to a primary alcohol.

But the options don't show any alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent is an aldehyde, then the reaction might not have anything to do with it, but perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis gives an amine. But again, the options don't have that.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The IR and NMR data seem to suggest that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a hydrolysis, but since it's already a carboxylic acid, perhaps nothing changes. But since the question asks for the product, I must have made a mistake because the product can't be the same as the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. So, if X is an ester, the product would be the acid (option C). But the IR of X shows a peak at 1720, which fits an ester, and the NMR doesn't show an O-H, which would be expected for an ester. Wait, in the NMR, the peak at 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde, which doesn't fit with an ester. So, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones and forms lactones, which might not fit.

At this point, I think I need to conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the IR and NMR data fit that structure, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Analyzing IR Data
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, indicating a benzene ring.

### Step 2: Analyzing NMR Data
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Step 3: Determining the Structure of Compound X
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent containing:
- A CH group at 2.9 ppm.
- A CH₂ group at 1.7 ppm.
- A CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).
- A terminal CH₃ group at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

This matches the structure of **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**:
- A benzoic acid group (-COOH) in the para position.
- A sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)) in the other para position.

### Step 4: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines or the reduction of nitriles to alcohols. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, no reaction would occur under these conditions. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Step 5: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. This does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group.
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches the IR and NMR data and is consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group.

### Final Answer
The compound is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, and the reaction does not change its structure. Therefore, the final product is:

**Answer: C**
