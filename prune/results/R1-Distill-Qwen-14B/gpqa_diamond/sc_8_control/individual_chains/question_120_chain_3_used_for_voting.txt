Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, yes, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). So p = 1/d, something like that.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly means the same number density, right? So the number density of stars is constant in space. But how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax?

Let me think about the volume involved. Parallax is in parsecs, and distance d is 1/p. So for a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. But how does the volume relate to distance? Oh, volume depends on the cube of the radius. So volume V is proportional to d³, which is (1/p)³.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think I need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between p and p+dp relates to p.

Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume dV would be n * dV, where n is the number density. So the number of stars per unit parallax dp would be n * dV per dp.

Hmm, what's dV in terms of p and dp? Well, for a thin shell at distance d, the volume is the surface area of a sphere times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², and the thickness in distance is dd. But wait, I have dp, the change in parallax. Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But I'm considering a small change, so the sign might not matter here.

So dV = 4π d² * dd = 4π d² * (-d² dp) )= -4 π d^4 dp.

Wait, but d is 1/p, so d = 1/p. So d^4 is (1/p)^4, and d^2 is (1/p)^2. Let me substitute:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( (1/p)^2 * dp )? Wait, no. Let me recast it. Because dd is d² dp. So dV = 4π d² * dd =4π d² (d² dp) )=4 π d^4 dp.

But since d =1/p, d^4 is (1/p)^4. So dV =4 π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is number density n multiplied by dV. So N = n * dV = n * 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is per unit range of parallax, so we're looking at N per dp. So N = (n *4 π) * (1/p^4) ) * dp. Therefore, the number per unit p (so per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait wait, but the options don't have 1/p^4. Let me look again. Oh, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be 1/p^4. But wait, wait! Because the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So the number is N per dp. So N is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit p is 1/p^4.

But wait, I'm getting confused. The number of stars in a shell at distance d (parallax p) depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell between p and p+dp is the surface area (4π d²) multiplied by the thickness in distance dd. But dd is related to dp.

Wait, let me re-derive this step by step. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. The volume of a thin spherical shell between radius d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec, say).

But since p is 1/d, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting d = 1/p,

The number of stars N is n * 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * ( - (1/p²) dp ) )

Wait, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * ( (1/p²) dp )

So that's 4 π n (1/p^4) dp.

Therefore, the number per unit range of p is (dN/dp) = 4 π n / p^4.

So as p increases, the number of stars per unit p decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but that's option A, which is 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. Because the question is phrased as "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So for a given p, as p increases, how does the number per dp change?

Yes, because for each small change in p (dp), the number of stars in that bin is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit p is ~1/p^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that in some cases, when counting stars, the number per unit distance increases with distance. But wait, that's when considering volume. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp. The volume at distance d is 4πd² dd, where dd is the change in distance. Since p =1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp.

So for a given p, the volume element is 4π (d)^2 dd = 4π (1/p)^2 ( (1/p²) dp ) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is (n 4 π) (1/p^4) ) * (dp / dp) → 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct option is A, ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars \( n \) is constant throughout space.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( p = 1/d \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( dp \): \( dd = -d^2 dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), we find \( dd = -(1/p^2) dp \). The volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \( n \cdot dV \), which gives:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \left(-\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp\right).
\]

Since the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \), we focus on the term \( \frac{N}{dp} \), which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{N}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/p^4 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
