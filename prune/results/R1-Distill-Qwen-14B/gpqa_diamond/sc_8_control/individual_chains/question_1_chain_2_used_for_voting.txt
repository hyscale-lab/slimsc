Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which energy difference option would allow us to resolve them clearly?

Hmm. I remember that the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula, I think, is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the energy uncertainty and the time (lifetime) should be about ħ over 2.

Wait, but the problem is about distinguishing two states. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart. 

So each state has its own uncertainty in energy, based on its lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty, because Δt is larger. So for E1 with Δt = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*(1e-9)). And for E2 with Δt = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*(1e-8)). 

But wait, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than either of these uncertainties? Or greater than the sum? Or perhaps just greater than the maximum uncertainty? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. But when considering the energy difference between the two states, the combined uncertainty would come into play. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy difference needed to be resolved is determined by the uncertainty in the measurement. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy, then the levels can be distinguished.

But wait, the uncertainty in energy for a state refers to the precision of knowing its energy. So if the energy difference between the two states is larger than the uncertainty, then they are resolvable. So probably, the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Or maybe the sum? Or perhaps it's the sum because when you have two states, the total uncertainty in their measurements would be the combination of both?

Wait, perhaps I should approach it more methodically. Let's calculate the uncertainties.

First, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Given that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes, when working in eV and seconds, it's easier to use the value in eV·s. Let's remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert ħ into eV·s, we can compute:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

The uncertainty principle gives ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for each state, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

Let's compute ΔE1 for the first state with Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) ≈ (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 2 = 3.291, so 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) eV.

2e-8 is 2 * 1e-8 = 2e-8.

6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 eV = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-8 is:

6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * (1e-16 / 1e-8) ) = 3.291 * 1e-8 eV.

Yes, so ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties? Or perhaps it's the larger of the two uncertainties? Because each state's uncertainty affects how precisely we can measure its energy.

Wait, but the energy difference is what's being compared to the uncertainty. I think the rule of thumb is that the energy difference should be significantly larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty for each state, then the two energies can be distinguished.

Wait, but what's the exact criterion? Let's think. Suppose you have two states with energies E1 and E2. If the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| is smaller than the uncertainty in either energy, then you can't tell them apart. Because the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and in E2 is ΔE2. So if ΔE < max(ΔE1, ΔE2), then their separation is less than the uncertainty of one of them, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, but wait. Actually, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in the measurement, then you can't resolve them. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. But what's the uncertainty in the measurement when you have two states?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each state has a certain lifetime and thus an uncertainty in energy. The energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their respective ΔE. So the separation must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, let me think about this. Let's say E1 is known within ±ΔE1, and E2 is known within ±ΔE2. The actual energy of E1 could be E1 + x (where |x| <= ΔE1), and E2 could be E2 + y (|y| <= ΔE2). The smallest possible separation would be (E2 - E1) - (ΔE2 + ΔE1). To have E2 > E1, the minimum separation would be (E2 - E1) - (ΔE2 + ΔE1) > 0. So E2 - E1 > ΔE2 + ΔE1.

Wait, but that's the same as the separation being larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, but in this scenario, the two states' energy uncertainties are from their own lifetimes. So the combined uncertainty in their separation is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than ΔE_total. Therefore, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) ≈ 6.582e-16 / (2e-9) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

The sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → much smaller than 3.6e-7. Not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Let me compute 3.6e-7 as 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So this option would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 eV. Compare to 3.6e-7 → 3.6e-7 is 36e-8. So 1e-8 is much smaller than 36e-8. So D is not sufficient.

Wait, so option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So the energy difference is much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, so it's resolvable.

But wait, the problem is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So if E2 - E1 is 1e-4 eV, and the sum of uncertainties is 3.6e-7 eV, then 1e-4 is larger, so they can be clearly distinguished.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two states is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
