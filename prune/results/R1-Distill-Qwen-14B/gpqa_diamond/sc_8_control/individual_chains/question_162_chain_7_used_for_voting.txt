Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because it only has dx and dy. So the line element depends on x and y, which suggests it's a 2D spacetime or maybe a 2D spatial surface? Not sure yet.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh right, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. But I'm a bit confused about how the metric relates to that.

So first, I think I need to figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents. The metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar function multiplied by dx² + dy². So the metric can be written as ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²). The function f(x,y) here is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

I remember that in conformally flat metrics, the curvature is related to the scalar function. The Ricci scalar curvature R is given by the formula involving the Laplacian of ln(f). Wait, let me think. The formula is R = - (1/(2f)) * ∇² ln(f). Or something like that. So maybe I can compute the curvature here.

But wait, the question isn't about curvature directly; it's about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh, but perhaps the pseudosphere is the surface described by this metric. Or maybe the metric is for a pseudosphere. Hmm.

Wait, pseudospheres in 2D have negative curvature. The standard pseudosphere metric is usually written in terms of r and θ. Let me recall. The metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) in 2D is ds² = dr² + (a^2 / cosh(r/a))² dθ², where a is the radius. But that's for a specific coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given here is related to a pseudosphere. Let's see. The denominator in the metric function is (4 - x² - y²). Let me set x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes (4 - r²). The numerator is 32. So f(r) = 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, in polar coordinates, r is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So if I express x and y in polar coordinates, r = sqrt(x² + y²), then the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So this is a two-dimensional metric with r and θ coordinates.

Wait, but a pseudosphere has a specific metric. Let me think again. The metric of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is usually written as ds² = dr² + (a^2 / cosh(r/a))² dθ². Comparing that to the given metric, which in polar coordinates is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, not sure if that's the same form.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the given metric is conformally flat, so the area element can be found from the determinant of the metric. Because for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(determinant) dr dθ. But wait, the given metric is only in terms of dx and dy, not necessarily polar coordinates. Let me compute the determinant.

The metric in terms of x and y is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element would be (32/(4 - r²))² dx dy. But in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So substituting, the area element becomes (32/(4 - r²))² * r dr dθ.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the metric, 4 - r² is in the denominator. So when r approaches 2, the denominator goes to zero. So that suggests that r can't be larger than 2, as the denominator would become negative, which would make the metric imaginary. So perhaps the maximum radius is 2. So a pseudosphere of radius r=2 would be the maximum possible, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the area is computed by integrating the area element over all allowed r and θ. But what are the limits on r? Let's see, 4 - x² - y² must be positive, so x² + y² <4. So r must be less than 2. So the radius r=2 is the boundary. So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A would be the integral of (32/(4 - r²))² * r dr dθ, integrated from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2.

Let me compute that. First, factor out the 32^2 = 1024. So A = 1024 ∫ (1/(4 - r²)^2) * r dr dθ from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π.

Let me compute the θ integral first. ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 1024 * 2π ∫0 to 2 [ r / (4 - r²)^2 ] dr.

Let me compute the integral I = ∫ r/(4 - r²)^2 dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So I becomes ∫ (1/u^2) * (-du/2). The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So I = (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of u^(-2) du.

Which is (-1/2)[ -u^(-1) ] from 4 to 0.

So evaluating: [(-1/2) ( (-1/u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ) ].

Wait, let me do this step by step. The integral becomes ∫u from 4 to 0 of (1/u²) * (-du/2). So, factor out the -1/2:

I = (-1/2) ∫ [1/u²] du from u=4 to u=0.

The integral of 1/u² is -1/u. So:

I = (-1/2) [ (-1/u) ) ] from 4 to 0.

= (-1/2) [ (-1/0) - (-1/4) ) ]

Wait, but 1/0 is infinity. Hmm, this suggests that the integral I is divergent, or tends to infinity.

Wait, because when u approaches zero, 1/u approaches infinity. So the integral from 4 to 0 would be integrating from a finite point to zero, and as u approaches zero, the function behaves like 1/u². So the integral would be divergent (goes to infinity).

Wait, but wait, the substitution was u=4 - r². So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So in the original integral, the point r=2 is the upper limit. So the integral from 0 to 2 would involve u going to zero. So the integral I becomes:

I = (-1/2) [ (-1/0) + (1/4) ) ]

Which is (-1/2) [ ∞ + (1/4) ) ] → (-1/2)(∞) → -∞. But since the integral is taken from u=4 to u=0, the substitution leads to the integral flipping the limits, so perhaps I should have:

I = (-1/2) [ (-1/u)| from 4 to 0 ]

= (-1/2) [ (-1/0) - (-1/4) ) ]

= (-1/2) [ ( -∞ ) + (1/4) ) ] → (-1/2)(-∞) → ∞.

Hmm, but the integral ends up being positive infinity. So the area A would be 1024 * 2π * ∞ → which is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps.

Let me recompute the integral I:

I = ∫ [r/(4 - r²)^2] dr from r=0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So I = ∫ (r dr) / u² = ∫ (-du/2) / u² = (-1/2) ∫ u^-2 du.

The integral of u^-2 is (-1)u^-1 + C.

So I = (-1/2) [ (-1/u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

So:

I = (-1/2) [ (-1/0) - (-1/4) ) ]

But 1/0 is infinity, so:

I = (-1/2) [ (-∞) - (-1/4) ) ] → (-1/2)( -∞ + 1/4 ) → (-1/2)(-∞) → (1/2) * ∞ → ∞.

So the integral I is divergent, tending to infinity. Hence, the area A is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area. Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere is embedded in a way that leads to finite area. But according to this calculation, the area seems to be infinite.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I got the wrong expression for the area. Because the metric is given in terms of x and y, perhaps I should interpret it as a 2D spatial surface, and compute its area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach. The area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is known to be 4π a², where a is the radius. But in this case, the radius given is 2. So if a=2, the area would be 4π (2)^2 =16π. But that's one of the options. Wait, no, looking at the options, option B is 4π(x² + y²), which can't be the area. Option D is +infty.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the area is infinite because the integral diverges at r=2. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why is the area infinite? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric component go to infinity. So the area element blows up at r=2, leading to an infinite area. So the pseudosphere's area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, where the conformal factor is \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first interpret the metric in polar coordinates by setting \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \). The metric then becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is \( \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dr \, d\theta \), where \( \text{det}(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32^2}{(4 - r^2)^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \( A \) is obtained by integrating the area element over the allowed range of \( r \) and \( \theta \). From the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \), it is clear that \( r \) must satisfy \( r < 2 \) to keep the metric real. Therefore, the integration limits for \( r \) are \( 0 \) to \( 2 \), and for \( \theta \), they are \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). The area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{1024}{(4 - r^2)^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the \( \theta \)-integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Now, compute the \( r \)-integral:

\[
I = \int_0^2 \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
I = \int_4^0 \frac{-1/2}{u^2} du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u^2} du.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{u^2} \) is \( -\frac{1}{u} \), so:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\frac{1}{u} \right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{0} \right].
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \frac{1}{u} \to \infty \), leading to:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\frac{1}{4} + \infty \right] = \infty.
\]

Thus, the area \( A \) becomes:

\[
A = 1024 \cdot 2\pi \cdot I = \infty.
\]

The area of the pseudosphere is infinite due to the divergence of the integral at \( r = 2 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
