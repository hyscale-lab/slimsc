Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh right, nu here is a neutrino. And it's stated that the Pi(+) is stationary. The masses are given: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies. I think each option lists the KE of the muon and the neutrino, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem says "KE of product particles", so both the muon and the neutrino, right.

So, the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Oh, right, conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think about the conservation laws.

So, the total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote the energies and momenta of the muon and neutrino.

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units are a bit tricky here. Wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in MeV, masses in MeV/c², and momentum in MeV/c. So let me think in terms of units where c=1, which simplifies the equations.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ), and similarly E_nu = sqrt( p_nu² + 0 ) since neutrinos are massless (or their mass is negligible, so we can treat them as massless particles). So E_nu = p_nu.

Since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_mu = p_nu = p (but opposite directions). Wait, magnitude, so p_mu = p, p_nu = p. So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu² ), and E_nu = p.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu² ) + p.

This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me rearrange this equation. Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7² ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6 - x)^2 = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * x + x².

So, substituting back:

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x + x².

I can subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that.

105 * 105 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, but wait, 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7². So that's 10000 + 1140 + 32.49= 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 -0.4)^2= 140² -2*140*0.4 +0.4² =19600 - 112 +0.16= 19488.16.

So substituting:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 *139.6 x.

Rearranging for x:

2 *139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 minus 11172.49: Let me subtract, 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11000=8488.16, then subtract another 172.49: 8488.16 -172.49= 8315.67.

So, 2*139.6 x = 8315.67.

Now, 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So, x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30= 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 is a bit high.

So, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376 minus 279.2= 8096.8.

Wait, no, wait 279.2 *29: 279.2 *20=5584, 279.2 *9=2512.8, total=5584+2512.8=8096.8.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is higher than 8096.8. So let's see how much difference that is.

8315.67 -8096.8= 218.87.

So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So, x ≈29 +0.783=29.783.

Wait, x is p, which is the momentum of the muon and the neutrino. So, p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

So, 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.783.

So, 29.783 is approximately 29.78. Let's call it approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm the calculation using exact numbers. Maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use decimal places for more precise calculation.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 as before.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 divided by 279.2.

So 279.2 * x =218.87 → x=218.87 /279.2.

Compute that.

218.87 /279.2.

Let me compute 218.87 ÷ 279.2.

Approximately, 279.2 is about 280, 218.87 is about 219.

219 /280 ≈ 0.782.

So x≈0.782.

So, total x=29 +0.782=29.782.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but that's the value of p. Now, let's compute the energies.

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(29.78² + 105.7²).

Compute 29.78 squared: (30 -0.22)^2= 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22² ≈900 -13.2 +0.0484≈ 886.8484.

105.7 squared is 11172.49.

So, 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.

So, E_mu = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and its energy is 109.81 MeV, which makes sense because it's moving, so its energy is higher than rest mass.

But then, the neutrino's energy is p ≈29.78 MeV.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 +29.78≈139.59 MeV, which is approximately 139.6 MeV. So that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy.

For the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 =4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino: Since it's massless, its energy is all kinetic. So KE_nu= E_nu =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the pion is at rest, so the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. So the KE of the muon is 4.11 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated. The slight differences are probably due to rounding during the calculation.

So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.8 MeV. So the correct option would be D.

Wait, let me quickly check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 2.84 and 26.8. That seems much lower than what we calculated.

Option B: 7.2 and 32.8. Hmm, our neutrino's KE is about 29.8, so 32.8 is higher. But according to our calculation, 29.78 is correct.

Option C: 3.52 and 20.8. Also lower.

So D is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is treated as massless.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Conservation of Energy:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum is conserved, and the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} = p.
   \]

2. **Energy of the Muon:**  
   The energy of the muon is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]  
   For the neutrino, since it is massless:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p.
   \]

3. **Total Energy After Decay:**  
   The total energy after decay is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
   \]  
   Setting \(E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}\), we solve for \(p\):  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging the equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2m_{\pi^+}p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
2m_{\pi^+}p = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
2(139.6)p = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.
\]  
Calculating squares:  
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]  
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Energy and Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The energy of the muon is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). This matches **Option D**.
