Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

First, I need to understand what a pseudosphere is. From what I recall, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbolic space, right? But how does that tie into the metric given here?

The metric provided is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this might be in a conformally flat form. Because the metric looks like it's a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²), which is the standard Euclidean metric. So, the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Now, the area of a surface in two dimensions can be found using the metric. The area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But in this case, since the metric is diagonal and each component is the same (because it's conformally flat), the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait—no, the determinant for a 2x2 diagonal metric is just the product of the diagonal terms. Since both off-diagonal terms are zero, the metric tensor is diag(A, A), so determinant is A². But A here is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, but wait, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait a second, hold on. I think I might have this right. So the area element becomes 32/(4 - x² - y²) times dx dy. So the total area is the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined, which would be where the denominator is positive. So 4 - x² - y² must be positive, which implies x² + y² <4. Wait, that makes sense because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up—so that's the boundary of our integration region.

So our integration is over the disk x² + y² <4. Therefore, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r ranges from 0 to 2 (since 2²=4), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So substituting, the area integral becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Because dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

Breaking that apart, we can separate the variables:
Integral over θ: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.
So the area is 2π * ∫0 to 2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr.

Hmm, let's compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ from r=0 to r=2 [32/(u)] * (r dr) = 32 ∫ [1/u] * (r dr)
But r dr is -(du/2), so the limits flip when u goes from 4 to 0.

So substituting, the integral becomes 32 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u)(-du/2) ) = 32 * (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, that's 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du. But wait, that integral is log(u) evaluated from 0 to 4. But wait, the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is divergent because as u approaches 0 from the positive side (since u=4-r², when r approaches 2, u approaches 0), 1/u becomes very large. So the integral becomes 16 [ln(4) - ln(0)] → 16 [ln(4) - (-infinity)] → which is 16*(infinity) → infinity.

So the area integral diverges. That suggests that the area is infinite. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) goes to infinity as you approach the boundary. So the area is unbounded, it's infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer should be D.

Another way to think about it: Pseudospheres are like the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So regardless of the radius, which in this case is 2, the area would be infinite. So the answer is D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat with a conformal factor of \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element \( dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is \( \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and thus \( \sqrt{\det(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The integration region is where the metric is defined, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), or equivalently \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( xy \)-plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the limits of integration change from \( r = 0 \) (\( u = 4 \)) to \( r = 2 \) (\( u = 0 \)). The integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot \frac{32}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \frac{1}{u} \) approaches infinity as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. 

In hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere (a model of hyperbolic space) has infinite area, consistent with this result. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is \( +\infty \).
