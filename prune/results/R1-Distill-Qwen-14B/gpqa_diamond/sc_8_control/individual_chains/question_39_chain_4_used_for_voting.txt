Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, I think the wave function in quantum mechanics usually has to satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right! The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

But wait, in this problem, it's mentioned that when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside this interval, right? But wait, looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that's kind of strange because it's a complex function. Oh, wait, the wave function can be complex, that's normal. But the important part is the modulus squared, which should integrate to 1 over the region where the wave function is non-zero.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So does that mean the wave function is zero outside [1,3], but inside that interval, it's given by that expression. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the integral of the modulus squared from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, because the modulus squared of a complex number A + Bi is A² + B². So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait a second. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the modulus, you get [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but that's the integral of the probability density. So the normalization condition is ∫|ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Let me write that out:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

So I can split this into two integrals:

a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫1 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 3-1=2.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the answer.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the total probability of finding the particle must equal 1. The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first term, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. For the second term, \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \), the integral of 1 over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.
