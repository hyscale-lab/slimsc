Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read through it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B along with water to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles might involve some kind of nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, the first reaction probably involves the addition of CN- to the ketone. But wait, NaCN provides CN- ions. So butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. But ketones typically don't react with HCN directly unless under certain conditions. Oh right, maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile, like in the presence of an acid catalyst. So for that, the ketone would attack the cyanide, and the acid would protonate to make the reaction happen.

So for the first reaction, A is acting as an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ (option A or B) or NaHSO3 (option C or D). Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ because it dissociates into H+ and HSO3^- ions. So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 provide H+ in solution. So both could act as acid catalysts.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would result from the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, followed by protonation. So the first step is the addition, then the protonation.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid, which could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. So the options for A are either H3O+ (A or B) or NaHSO3 (C or D). So, possible options are A, B, C, D.

Now, the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical way is hydrolysis. But what conditions? Nitrile hydrolysis can go through different pathways. Using acidic conditions with H2O can lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid if the hydrolysis is complete. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl or another acid catalyst might be necessary.

Wait, another possibility is the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides first, then further oxidation. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile is being oxidized. Alternatively, maybe under strong acidic conditions, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis to the acid.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is CH(OH)CH2CH2CN or something similar? Or maybe the substituents are more complex, but the main thing is that the nitrile is attached adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

So when you hydrolyze a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), you typically need strong acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you might use H2O and a catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes using HCl as the acid would help.

Wait, let me think. The general reaction for nitrile to carboxylic acid: under acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and H2O, the nitrile is hydrolyzed. Alternatively, in the presence of HCl and heat, perhaps. Or maybe using a strong acid like HCl in aqueous conditions.

Looking at the reagents, option B for the second reaction is H2O as a reagent. Wait, no, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product. So B is the reagent, and H2O is given as another component. Hmm, maybe I need to recheck.

Wait, the problem says: the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product. So the reagent B is used along with water. So B is the catalyst or the acid condition.

So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, which requires some acid. So the second reagent B should be an acid. Let's see the options.

Options for B are HCl (options A, C) or CH3COOH (options B, D).

So for the nitrile to acid hydrolysis, HCl (a strong acid) would be a suitable catalyst. Acetic acid is a weaker acid, but possible under certain conditions. I'm not sure about this, but I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you usually need a strong acid like HCl, especially if it's in aqueous conditions.

Wait, another point: sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed using H2O with an acid catalyst. So in the second reaction, since water is present, and the reagent B is the acid, the correct B would be HCl (so options A or C). Let me think about the options.

In the first part, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. If A is H3O+, then in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+. So looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl.

Wait, but for the first reaction, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A. In the presence of H3O+ (option A), would that be enough? Or if A is NaHSO3 (option C), which is a source of H+ as well. I think either could work as an acid catalyst, but perhaps using H3O+ is more straightforward for a cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So either H3O+ or something else. So for the first reaction, options A and B have H3O+ for A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 for A.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B. So if A is H3O+ (options A or B), then the second reaction's B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, if the correct reagent is HCl, then the options with B as HCl are A and C.

Wait, but option A has B as HCl, and A as H3O+.

Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl.

Now, what's the correct combination?

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction requires an acid. So A must be an acid. So either H3O+ or NaHSO3 would work.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. For that, I think the reaction requires a strong acid. HCl is a strong acid, so B would be HCl (so options A and C).

So now, looking at the options, only options A and C have B as HCl. So which one is correct?

Wait, the first reaction's A is H3O+ (option A) or NaHSO3 (option C). Which acid is more appropriate for the cyanohydrin formation?

I think that in the formation of cyanohydrins, an acid catalyst is needed, like H2SO4 or H3O+. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, but I'm not sure. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- can donate a proton), but it's a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction of ketone with NaCN and H3O+ would proceed smoothly. Alternatively, NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) might act as a source of H+ and also could provide some S-based functionality, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. For the cyanohydrin formation, any acid catalyst should work, but perhaps the stronger acid is better.

Alternatively, if the reaction is done under mild conditions, perhaps a weaker acid is sufficient.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H+ → product.

So, the acid can be H3O+ or another acid source. So in the options, whether it's H3O+ or NaHSO3 as A is the question.

Now, the second reaction's product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile (-CN) must be converted to COOH. The reaction is:

R-C≡N + H2O, B → R-COOH

So for that, the conditions are hydrolysis. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions. So using HCl (a strong acid) would be appropriate.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

So now, looking at the options, for B to be HCl, the options are A and C.

So the possibilities are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Which of these is correct?

Wait, for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A.

But wait, NaCN is a source of CN-. In the presence of an acid, the ketone's carbonyl becomes more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A is the acid. So either H3O+ (option A) or NaHSO3 (option C) would work.

But NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's a salt of HSO3^- which is a weak acid). So both could act as the acid catalyst.

So both options A and C could be possible for the first reaction, but the second reaction requires B to be HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer must be either option A or C, but I need to pick the right one.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is using a specific acid. Let me think: in the formation of cyanohydrins, what's the typical catalyst? I think it's usually an acid, like HCl, H2SO4, or similar. But in the options, we have H3O+ (option A) or NaHSO3 (option C). So, which is more likely?

H3O+ is a strong acid, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid (since HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+).

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. The reaction is:

RCOCH3 + CN^- → RCOCH2OH (but wait, no, the actual product is R'COCH2CN, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's R'COH + CN^- adds to form R'CH(OH)CN.

Wait, but no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, and the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, making (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So for the reaction, the acid catalyst would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So, the choice between H3O+ and NaHSO3 for A.

Hmm, perhaps the choice depends on what the second reaction requires. Wait, the second reaction's reagent B is HCl, so in option A, A is H3O+ and B is HCl, so both are strong acids. But in option C, A is NaHSO3 (weaker acid) and B is HCl.

But the first reaction requires an acid, but perhaps using NaHSO3 is sufficient. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should think about which reagent is more appropriate for each step.

Wait, another approach: for the first step, if the reaction is done in acidic conditions, and NaCN is added, but perhaps the presence of H3O+ is needed. Alternatively, NaHSO3 might not supply enough H+ for the reaction.

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ but it's a weaker acid. So it can donate a proton, but perhaps for the ketone to react with CN-, a stronger acid is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction doesn't require a strong acid. Let me think: when NaCN is added to a ketone in an acidic medium, the H+ from the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon positively charged. Then the CN- attacks, forming the cyanohydrin. So any acid that can donate H+ would work.

So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 can donate H+, but perhaps H3O+ is a stronger acid, which might make the reaction proceed more efficiently.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 because it's a weaker acid and the reaction doesn't require a strong acid.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, NaHSO3 would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- can donate a proton to become SO3^2- or accept a proton to become H2SO3. In acidic conditions, it would be HSO3^- acting as an acid.

Wait, but the pH of the solution would depend on the concentration of HSO3^-.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the correct answer is option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl.

Wait, but why? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and also provides sulfite ions, which might have some role. Or perhaps in the first reaction, the sulfite acts as an acid, and in the second reaction, HCl is the acid.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a connection between the first reaction and the role of NaHSO3 beyond being an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is an acid-catalyzed reaction, and in the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid under strong acidic conditions (HCl).

So, looking back at the options, option C would have A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. Option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

But I'm not sure which one is the correct combination for the first reaction.

Another angle: perhaps in the first reaction, the addition of NaCN and another reagent is a specific reaction condition. Let me think: NaCN is added to a ketone in the presence of an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+.

Wait, wait, I think I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones is typically carried out in an aqueous solution with an acid catalyst. So the presence of H3O+ (option A) would be appropriate as the acid catalyst.

So, option A would have A as H3O+ (acid for the first reaction) and B as HCl (acid for the second reaction).

But wait, in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed. For that, you often use HCl in aqueous conditions, like HCl and water, which is option A's B.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, and the second uses HCl, then option A would be correct.

But wait, the options for A are the reagents in the first reaction. So the first step uses A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 is not a strong enough acid for the first reaction, and H3O+ is needed.

But then, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each reaction.

First reaction:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

This is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction requires an acid catalyst. So A is an acid.

Second reaction:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This typically requires strong acidic conditions, like HCl in water.

So, for the second reaction, B is HCl. So options A and C are the only ones with B as HCl.

So in the options, option A has A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C has A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

So which one is correct for the first reaction?

If the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, then option A is correct.

But what if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid? Would that work?

I think that either could work, but perhaps the problem expects the stronger acid, H3O+.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ because the product is a primary or secondary alcohol.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. The formation of the cyanohydrin would give a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but in any case, the choice is between H3O+ and NaHSO3 as the catalyst.

I think that NaHSO3 is a weaker acid compared to H3O+.

So, perhaps for the first reaction, stronger acid like H3O+ is needed.

So, the correct option would be option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A's B is HCl, which is correct. So that would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different acid. Wait, another thought: for the second reaction, if the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps the reaction conditions are different.

Wait, 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would have the structure HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CN. No, wait, the structure is more likely to be (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

Wait, but in any case, the nitrile is at the alpha position to a hydroxyl group. So when it hydrolyzes, it would form a carboxylic acid.

But perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the reaction. Hmm.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think I'm more confident that HCl is the correct reagent for the second reaction, so option A and C are possible.

Between the two, I think the first reaction uses H3O+, so option A is correct.

Wait, but another angle: Maybe the first reaction uses NaHSO3 because it's a milder acid, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses NaHSO3 as a sulfonic acid source, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps if the first reaction is done in solution, H3O+ would be more straightforward.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, requiring an acid catalyst. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Reactions:

1. **First Reaction**:  
   Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst (A) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. Acid catalysts like H₃O⁺ or NaHSO₃ can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for CN⁻ to attack. Both H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃ can act as acid catalysts, but H₃O⁺ is a stronger acid and is commonly used for such reactions.

2. **Second Reaction**:  
   2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions. HCl is a suitable reagent for this reaction.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl)**:  
  H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and an appropriate catalyst for the first reaction. HCl is a strong acid and suitable for the second reaction. This combination is consistent with the requirements.

- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH)**:  
  While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough for the second reaction, where a strong acid like HCl is required. This option is incorrect.

- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl)**:  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺, but it can still act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction. HCl is suitable for the second reaction. While this option is plausible, H₃O⁺ is more commonly used for cyanohydrin formation due to its stronger acidity.

- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH)**:  
  NaHSO₃ is suitable for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The most appropriate reagents are H₃O⁺ for the first reaction and HCl for the second reaction, as indicated in **Option A**.
