Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let's see what I remember about this.

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the first thing I should probably do is calculate the new concentration after dilution. Wait, because when you dilute, the amount of solute stays the same, right? So the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, volume is in cm³ which is the same as mL. So let me convert that to liters? Or maybe it's easier to just keep in mL since the units will cancel out.

So, initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = 0.05 M × 20.00 cm³. Oh wait, M is mol/L, and cm³ is mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 mol/L × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Yeah, that makes sense.

Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what does 25% titration mean? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the pH when 25% of the acid has reacted.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution.

2. Determine the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration.

3. Determine the new concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- in the solution after adding that NaOH.

4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH at 25% titration.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions. But since acetate is a weak base, the solution will be basic. So, I'll need to calculate the concentration of acetate and then find the pH from that.

But wait, let's take it step by step.

Starting with the diluted solution: 0.025 M acetic acid. The volume is 40 cm³. So moles = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Right, same as before.

Now, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, volume needed is V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the problem is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So 25% of the acetic acid is being titrated. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but let me think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid.

So, at 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added.

So the moles after reaction:

CH3COOH: initial moles 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but when you add NaOH, it's not just mixing into the same volume. Because adding NaOH solution will change the total volume of the solution. So I need to calculate the new total volume.

Wait, the initial solution (diluted acetic acid) is 40 cm³. Then, when adding 10 cm³ (for equivalence), but wait 25% titration would require only part of the NaOH solution. Wait, 25% of the moles needed.

Wait, the total volume at 25% would be the initial 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) plus the volume of NaOH added for 25% titration.

Wait, the moles of NaOH at 25% titration is 0.00025 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH added is (0.00025 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So total volume becomes 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion in the solution are:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = (0.00075 / 0.0425) ≈ 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73? Let me calculate that.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa= log(1/1.85e-5) → let's compute that.

Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. Hmm, that's approximately 4.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, so my initial calculation gives around 4.25, but let's double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me re-calculate [A^-] and [HA].

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333.

Log(1/3) is exactly -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, so approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 as the first pH value, which is close. But let me see if I made any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, the 25% titration is based on the moles of acetic acid. So that part seems correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using exact concentrations without assuming dilution, but using the buffer equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the buffer equation considering the dilution.

Wait, another way is to calculate the concentration after adding NaOH, considering the dilution.

Wait, but I think I did it correctly.

So at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.25, which rounds to 4.26. So that's the first part. Now, the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ions comes from the sodium acetate.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid was neutralized). The total volume at equivalence point is initial 40 cm³ + volume of NaOH added (which was 10 cm³). So total volume is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced. So:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So:

x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5 → pKa≈4.73.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression is correct.

Wait, so x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) = log(1/1.04e-5) → log(9.615e4) → 4.982.

pH = 14 -4.982 ≈9.018.

Hmm, but the options don't have equivalence points near 9. Let me check the options: option A's equivalence is 8.52, option D's is 6.92. Wait, that doesn't match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Oh! Wait, perhaps I forgot that the sodium acetate solution is in a larger volume. Let me recheck the volume at equivalence.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ of NaOH gives a total volume of 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb expression. Let me try another approach using the Henderson equation at equivalence point.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is converted to conjugate base. So the solution is just acetate ions in water. So using the Kb approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me calculate Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression without the approximation.

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5. Same as before.

pOH ≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. Looking back at the options:

Option A) 4.26;8.52

Option D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence point, NaOH moles is 0.001 mol. So volume of NaOH is 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence is calculated using a different approach, like the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, another way: the acetate ion in water will form a buffer with its conjugate acid (acetic acid). So pOH = pKb + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to base, so [base] is 0.02 M and [acid] is 0. So that approach won't work. So perhaps I should just proceed with the Kb calculation.

Wait, I think the mistake must be elsewhere. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, maybe I forgot that the solution is sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

But the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^-.

So, perhaps I should calculate the pH correctly.

Wait, let me recalculate the Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Let me set up the equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x, x, x.

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02) =5.405e-10.

So x²=5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me check again.

Wait, when I diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So moles are 0.025 *0.04 =0.001 mol. Correct.

So I'm confident the calculation is correct, but the options don't have 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the dilution effect correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the 25% titration is based on the volume of NaOH added, not the moles. Wait, no, I think 25% refers to the moles. Because titration is based on moles neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the pH at equivalence point with a more accurate calculation, without approximation.

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

x²=5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, x^2 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

But perhaps I should check if x is significant compared to 0.02. 1e-5 is 0.00001, and 0.02 is 0.02, so it's 0.05% of 0.02. So approximation holds.

So pH is ~9.02. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then it's diluted with 20 cm³ of water.

So, after dilution, the concentration is 0.05 M × (20/40) =0.025 M. Correct.

So 0.025 M × 0.04 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

So the moles are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the equivalence pH. Maybe I should use the formula for a weak base.

Wait, another approach: the pH of a solution of a weak base can be calculated using the formula:

cB = 0.02 M.

pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log c)

Wait, pKb is log(1/(5.405e-10)) → log(1.85e9) → approximately 9.267.

Wait, no, wait: pKb = -log(Kb) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.267.

So pOH = 0.5 (pKb - log c) → c is 0.02 M.

So log(0.02) is -1.69897.

So pOH = 0.5 (9.267 - (-1.69897)) → 0.5*(10.96597) → 5.483.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then pH would be ~8.52. Wait, but that would match option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

pOH = (pKb + log c ) / 2.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

For a weak base, the concentration is c, and the Kb is known.

The approximate [OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * c )

Wait, that's what I did earlier, which gave me [OH^-] = 1.04e-5, pOH≈4.98, pH≈9.02.

But the formula I was trying in my head earlier was for when you have a solution of a weak base and you're using the approximation [OH] ≈ sqrt( Kb*c ), which is what I did.

Alternatively, here's another approach using the exact solution of the quadratic equation.

The equation is x² = Kb * c * (0.02 - x), but let's consider the equation correctly. Wait, Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps the exact solution is better.

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 → approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈6.58e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.58e-6]/2 → take the positive root.

x ≈ (6.58e-6)/2 → 3.29e-6.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approximation. So [OH^-]≈3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, that matches option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the earlier approximation. So where did I go wrong?

I think the mistake was in the initial assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02. Because when I used the quadratic formula, I got x≈3.29e-6, which is about 0.01645% of 0.02. So the approximation x <<0.02 is valid. So why is the result different?

Wait, wait, let me recalculate using the quadratic solution.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

x = [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 =2.92e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → approx 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) ≈6.576e-6.

Divide by 2: x=3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is ~0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.482. So pOH=5.482 → pH=14-5.482=8.518.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

But earlier, with the assumption that x is negligible, I got pH=9.02, but with the quadratic solution, it's 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the assumption. Because when I used the approximation, I set x²= Kb * c, but that's only valid when x is much smaller than c. But in this case, perhaps it's better to not make that assumption.

Wait, but wait, when I first did the calculation, I thought that Kb is 5.4e-10 and c is 0.02 M, so Kb*c is 1.08e-11. The square root of that is 1e-5.5, which is about 3e-6. So that's less than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So why did the first approach give pH=9.02, but the correct one is 8.52? It seems I had a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me see: earlier, I thought that [OH^-] was 1.04e-5, but that was a mistake. Because when I approximated Kb*c = x², x would be sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.08e-11) = 1.04e-5. But that's incorrect because the correct approach is to set Kb= x²/(c -x) → assuming x<<c, Kb*c =x² → x= sqrt(Kb*c) ≈1.04e-5. But wait, that's conflicting with the quadratic solution.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me re-express this.

The correct approach is:

Kb = x²/(c -x) → since x is small, c -x ≈c → x² ≈ Kb c → x= sqrt(Kb c).

So why does the quadratic solution give a different x?

Ah, because when Kb * c is small, the approximation holds, but when you compute x as sqrt(Kb*c), you get x= sqrt(5.4e-10 *0.02)= sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.04e-5.

But when I did the exact quadratic solution, I got x=3.29e-6.

Wait, this discrepancy suggests a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup.

Wait, the correct equation is Kb = (x²)/(c -x) → x² = Kb (c -x) → x² + Kb x - Kb c =0.

Wait, that's the correct quadratic equation.

So, in this case, Kb =5.405e-10, c=0.02.

So equation is x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Now, the solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 × 1e-20 → 29.214 × 1e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

4 *1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D=2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11.

4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so D≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) ≈6.576e-6.

Divided by 2 → x=3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is 8.52. So the correct answer for equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A.

But earlier, when I used the approximation, I got 1.04e-5 [OH^-], leading to pH=9.02. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I confused the expression. The correct expression from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is when the solution is a buffer, but at equivalence, it's a solution of the conjugate base, so using Kb is correct.

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

But in the first part, the pH at 25% titration was approximately 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

So the answer should be option A: 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).

The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate is a weak base, and its hydrolysis in water is governed by:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{c} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \) and \( c = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot c = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.
