Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space described here is 2D, but it's embedded in some way that makes it a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface in relativity.

I remember that a pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature. Oh wait, but how does that relate to the area? Well, for a regular sphere in 3D, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Or is it? Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with hyperbolic space.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So r is 2. But wait, in the metric, I don't see an 'r' parameter. Let me look again.

The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4 - (x² + y²). If r is 2, then 4 is r squared, right? Because 2 squared is 4. So maybe this metric is parameterized with r=2.

So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but that looks a bit like the metric for a hyperboloid or something. Or perhaps it's a 2D surface with a specific curvature.

I think the area element in 2D is given by sqrt(g) dxdy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me calculate that.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². The coefficient for both is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor components are g_xx and g_yy. So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy, since it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Hmm, but I need to integrate this over the entire surface to find the area. So the area A is the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the region of integration is where the denominator isn't zero, right? Because the metric would blow up if 4 - x² - y² = 0. So the domain is where x² + y² < 4. So the area is over the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So let me change to polar coordinates, since the problem is symmetric in x and y. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the θ integral first. The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π.

So A = 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So -du/2 = r dr.

Wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the limits go from u=4 to u=0 when r goes from 0 to 2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from 4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ].

Wait, let me write it more carefully. The integral is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dr, which in terms of u becomes:

32 * [ r dr ] / u → 32 * [ (-du/2) ) / u ].

So substituting, the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

But flipping the limits (from 0 to 4) removes the negative sign:

32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to 4) [1/u] du.

So that's 16 ∫ (0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du is ln u. So evaluating from 0 to 4:

16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ].

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 16 ( ln(4) - (-infty) ) → 16 (infty) → infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the area is infinite? But that doesn't make sense. Because a pseudosphere should have finite area, or is that not the case?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

Wait, the denominator is (4 - r²), which as r approaches 2, denominator approaches zero, so the integrand goes to infinity. So the integral is from 0 to 2, but the integrand has a term 1/(4 - r²) which behaves like 1/(4 - r²) near r=2. So the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, let me compute it without substitution. Let me expand the integrand:

∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] → (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du → (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2: at r=0, u=4. At r=2, u=0.

So the integral is [ (-1/2) ln(0) + (1/2) ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So [ (-1/2)(-infty) ) + (1/2) ln4 )] = (infty) + finite.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Oh, that's bad. So the area A is 2π * [ integral which diverges ] → infinity.

Wait, but the options don't have an 'infinite' option except for option D, which is +infty.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer would then be D.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the area is infinite, that's option D.

But I thought a pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is actually finite. But wait, maybe in this metric, the area is indeed infinite. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric again. Let me see: The given metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about what kind of surface this represents.

If I consider the form of the metric, it's similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk has a metric of the form (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite, but the Poincaré disk is a model that maps the whole hyperbolic plane into a finite disk.

Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which is 4(1 - (r²/4)), so similar to the Poincaré model scaled appropriately.

So perhaps the metric here is that of hyperbolic space with curvature. The area in this model would be the integral over the disk, which as I calculated, diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To calculate the area, we use the area element in 2D, which is given by \(\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is 

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes 

\[
\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The area \(A\) is then the double integral of the area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the region of integration is the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a radius of 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes 

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The area integral is 

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is 

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes 

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32 \, (-du/2)}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln u\), so evaluating from \(u = 0\) to \(u = 4\) gives 

\[
16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \(0\) is incorrect because the area is not zero.
- **B)** \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\) is incorrect because it does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C)** \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\) is incorrect for the same reason as **B**.
- **D)** \(+\infty\) is correct because the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
