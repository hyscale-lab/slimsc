Okay, let me try to figure out this astronomy question. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. Hmm, I remember that distance and parallax are related, so maybe I'll need to connect those concepts.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's a bit unusual. I thought the number of stars usually decreases with distance because they get fainter, but the exact relation might be different here.

So, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, distance decreases. Right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Let me think about how to express this in terms of distance. So plx is 1/d, so plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So substituting that into the number of stars equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, the original relation is N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, substitute that in: N = k / ( (1/d) )^5 = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. That's a lot!

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Normally, as you look farther, you can see more stars because you're covering a larger volume, but the number density might decrease due to the volume increasing with the cube of radius. Oh, but here the relation is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, so maybe the star density isn't uniform?

Wait, let me think about it another way. The number of stars in a region could depend on the volume. Volume increases with r^3. But if the star density (stars per unit volume) is varying, then the total number would be density multiplied by volume.

Suppose the number of stars per unit volume (number density) is n. Then total number N = n * Volume. If Volume is proportional to r^3, then N would go as r^3 if n is constant. But in this problem, n might not be constant. Let me see.

Alternatively, the problem gives N ∝ 1/plx^5, which as I did before translates to N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance in this scenario. That's interesting.

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the differential change, like dN/dr. Or perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr, proportional to 4πr² dr multiplied by the number density at that radius. Hmm, that's more complicated.

Wait, the problem is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're considering the number density per unit volume, or perhaps the differential number per unit distance.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. So per unit distance, the increase is even more.

Wait, but that's the total number of stars. But the options are about how the number changes per unit distance. So perhaps I should think about the derivative dN/dr.

Since N ∝ d^5, dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number of stars increases as d^4 per unit distance. Wait, that's for the rate of change. Alternatively, if you're looking at the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr, that would be dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5 d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But that's not exactly matching the options.

Wait, the options are about the number of stars changing with distance. So the way the number changes as you go from one distance to another. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as how the number density varies with distance.

Wait, perhaps the way the number increases with distance (r) is as r^5, but the rate of change (dN/dr) is r^4. So if the question is about the number per unit distance, then the answer would be ~ r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, okay, so perhaps the number of stars in a unit distance range (like between r and r+1) is proportional to how many stars are present in that thin shell. That would be dN = (dN/dr) dr. So if dN is proportional to d^4 dr, and dr is 1 (unit distance), then dN is proportional to d^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So looking at the answer options, option C is r^4, so that would be the choice.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." To interpret this, consider the number of stars in a thin shell between \( r \) and \( r + dr \). This is proportional to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which for \( N \propto d^5 \) is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the given options:

- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the relation derived is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) describes the total number of stars, not the number per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as there is no justification for this relation.

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance in the region of the sky increases as \( r^4 \).
