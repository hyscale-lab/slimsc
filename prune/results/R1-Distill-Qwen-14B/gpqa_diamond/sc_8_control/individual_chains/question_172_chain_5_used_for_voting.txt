Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think in terms of population of energy levels, right? So if the excitation is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy state. But wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the levels is known—1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, but since they're in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where N2 and N1 are the populations of the two energy levels, E2 and E1 their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In the problem, it's stated that the excitation is twice as high for star_1. So N1 (higher level) over N2 (lower level) is twice. Wait, actually, wait—the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Oh, so perhaps N_upper/N_lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Let me think. Excited state is higher energy. So more excited would mean higher population in the excited state. So for star_1, the population in the upper level (say level 2) compared to the lower (level 1) is higher.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe N2_1 / N1_1 = twice as much as N2_2 / N1_2. Or maybe the excitation is the ratio itself, so N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is 2 times that for star_2. Hmm, I think that's the correct interpretation.

So, for star_1, the ratio r1 = N2_1 / N1_1, and for star_2, r2 = N2_2 / N1_2. The question says that r1 is twice r2. So r1 = 2 * r2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each r is equal to exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, r = exp( - ΔE/(k T) ).

So for star_1, r1 = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, r2 = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ).

Given that r1 = 2 * r2, substituting the expressions:

exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, if star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, does that mean higher or lower temperature? Hmm, higher excitation usually implies higher temperature because more energy is available to excite the atoms. So star_1 is hotter than star_2, I think.

Let me rearrange the equation. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln(r1) = ln(2 r2)

Which becomes:

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Simplify:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively, [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But I don't have the values for k and ΔE, but wait, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without those constants.

Wait, another approach: Let's express the two expressions for r:

r1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
r2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

We have r1 = 2 r2.

So substituting:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) =2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln 2

So,

(ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) )= ln 2

But wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So, (ΔE (T1 - T2) ) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln 2

Hmm, but I don't know the value of ΔE or whether it's positive. Let me think about the actual values.

Wait, ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels. So, E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But when we plug into the equation, it's (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln 2.

I don't have the value of ΔE, but the problem gives it as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k). Let me see, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k multiplied by 1 K, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * (1 K) * (some factor, but in this case, 1 K would make ΔE =k*1, so here, ΔE is exactly k * 1, because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 into the equation:

(k * 1) (T1 - T2) ) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln 2

The k's cancel out:

( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln 2

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln 2 → ln 2 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be rewritten as ln 2 = [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

Wait, let me double-check. The equation we derived is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). So option D is exactly that.

Other options: A is ln2=T2/T1. That would mean T2 is a fraction of T1, but the equation we have T1-T2 positive, so T1 > T2.

Option B: ln2 = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2). That doesn't fit.

Option C: ln2 = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)^2. No, exponent is squared denominator.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is applied, which describes the population ratio of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(N_2\) and \(N_1\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as \(r_1 = 2r_2\), where \(r_1 = \frac{N_2}{N_1}\) for star_1 and \(r_2 = \frac{N_2}{N_1}\) for star_2. Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E/k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) (since \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), the \(k\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

The other options are inconsistent with the derived equation. For example:

- **Option A** (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\)) does not match the derived relationship.
- **Option B** (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1T_2}\)) introduces an incorrect addition of temperatures.
- **Option C** (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1T_2)^2}\)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is given by option D.
