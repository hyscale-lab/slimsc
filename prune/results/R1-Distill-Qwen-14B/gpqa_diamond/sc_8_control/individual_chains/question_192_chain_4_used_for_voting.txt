Okay, so I've got this physics problem, and I need to figure out the electric field at a point P outside a spherical conductor. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, smaller than R. The center of the cavity is shifted by distance s from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center; it's off to the side. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P which is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. I remember something about conductors and electric fields. Oh right, conductors have charges on the surface when they're uncharged, but wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, what happens? Oh, right, I think that the conductor would redistribute its charges in a certain way.

Wait, but the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's interior (the cavity) has induced charges. The inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the charge +q induces opposite charges on the cavity walls. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Oh wait, no. Wait a second. The conductor's total charge is initially zero. So when you have a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface must have a charge of -q (from induction), and the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. Because the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner is -q, so outer must be +q to have overall zero. Wait, but the conductor was uncharged, and the charge +q is placed inside. So the conductor must have a net charge of +q, because the total is the sum of the cavity's charge plus the conductor's charge. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so it has zero net charge. The cavity has a charge +q. How does that work? Oh, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface has +q so that the total conductor charge is +q? But that can't be, because the initial conductor was uncharged. Wait, no, perhaps the conductor's charge is zero, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, making the net conductor charge zero. Wait, that would make sense. Because the inner surface has -q, which cancels the +q inside, and the outer surface has +q, so the conductor's total charge is zero. Because the conductor was neutral, so the induced charges balance. Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on that. Let me think again.

The conductor is neutral. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity (which is inside the conductor), the conductor's inner surface (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the conductor's total is the sum of inner and outer. So inner is -q, outer is +q. Thus, the conductor's net charge is zero (since -q + q = 0). Because the conductor was neutral, that makes sense.

So the outer surface's charge is +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field at P, I can treat the conductor as a shell with charge +q on the outside. Because the electric field outside a conducting shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, the electric field due to the conductor's outer charge would be as if it's a point charge +q at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, and P is a point outside. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L. So the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²).

But wait, what about the charge inside the cavity? The point P is outside the conductor, so the field due to charges inside the conductor (like the inner cavity) doesn't affect the external field. Because of the shielding effect. So any charges inside the conductor's material or the cavity are screened. So the only contribution to the external field is from the outer surface's charge, which is +q.

So the external electric field would be the same as that produced by a point charge q at the center of the conductor. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's exactly what I'm thinking.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options have other possibilities. Option A has (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like it's considering the displacement between P and the cavity's center, considering the shift s. But wait, no. Because if the charge is inside the conductor, the field outside is only due to the outer charge. So the location of the cavity and where the +q is placed inside wouldn't matter for the external field. Because the conductor's outer surface has +q, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

Wait, but what if the cavity's position affects the distribution of the outer charge? Oh, but no, the outer charge is uniformly distributed if the conductor is spherical. Wait, no, if the inner cavity has a displaced charge, would the outer surface still be uniform? Hmm. Wait, no, because the inner surface's charge would be only affected by the charge inside the cavity. So the inner surface would have a charge distribution that's induced by the +q in the cavity. But the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner surface's charge, right? Because the conductor must maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

Wait, more accurately, the charges on the inner surface are induced by the +q in the cavity. So the inner surface has -q, but if the cavity's center is shifted by s, the inner surface's charge isn't uniformly distributed. It would have a dipole-like distribution or something.

But the outer surface is a conductor. In a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution must be such that the field inside the conductor (the material part, not the cavity) is zero. So if the inner surface has a certain charge distribution, the outer surface must adjust accordingly.

Wait, but the overall charge on the outer surface is +q. So, regardless of the inner distribution, the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust to create a field outside that's as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere. Wait, no, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity isn't at the center. So the outer surface might not be spherically symmetric. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface charge isn't uniform. So the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust to maintain electrostatic conditions. But for a spherical conductor, even if the inner cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Is that correct?

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think. In a spherical conductor, if the cavity has a charge inside, the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, but the outer surface will have +q, regardless of where the charge is placed in the cavity. Because the conductor's total charge is zero.

But the shape of the inner surface's charge isn't uniform if the cavity is off-center. So the inner surface's charge distribution depends on where the charge is placed.

But the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is spherical. Because the conductor's outer surface is symmetrically placed, so the charge +q on the outer surface would be uniformly distributed.

Wait, wait, no. Maybe not. If the inner surface has a non-uniform distribution, could that affect the outer surface's distribution? Oh, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. So the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves so that any external fields are canceled, but since there's no external field (the only charge outside is the conductor itself), the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the absence of external fields, a spherical conductor's outer surface charge would be uniform regardless of what's happening inside. Because any non-uniformity would create an internal field, which can't happen in a conductor.

So the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution of +q. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor (point P) is as if all the charge were at the center.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

Wait, but what about the position of the point P relative to the cavity center? The problem gives l, the distance from P to the cavity center, and an angle theta. Why are these variables given if they don't affect the outcome? Because the electric field outside is determined by the outer surface's charge, which is uniform and centered at the conductor's center.

So the variables l and theta don't matter because the field at P is only due to the +q on the outer surface, which is at the center. So the electric field is as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$. Thus, the conductor's outer surface has a net charge of $+q$, uniformly distributed due to spherical symmetry.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. This is a consequence of the shielding effect and the fact that the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

3. **Relevance of Variables $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**:  
   The problem provides additional variables: $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity center), $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity), and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$). However, these variables do not affect the electric field at $P$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed and centered at the conductor's center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because it suggests the field depends on the relative positions of $P$ and the cavity, which is not the case for external points.  
   - **Option B**: Correctly gives $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the field due to the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface of the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Gives $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$, which is incorrect because it assumes the field depends on the distance $l$ to the cavity center, not the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately represents the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor.
