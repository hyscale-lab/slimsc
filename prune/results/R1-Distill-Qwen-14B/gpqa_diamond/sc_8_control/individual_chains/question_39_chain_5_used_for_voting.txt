Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, wait, I think maybe I should write that down. Oh, right, the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, I remember that the wavefunction must be normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of ψ(x) over all space should equal 1. Because that's how probabilities work in quantum mechanics.

The problem says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So that means the wavefunction must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wavefunction is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Wait, maybe that's a typo or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expression.

Wait, let me read the original problem again. Oh, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a complex function. Because it's a sum of a real part and an imaginary part. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have an imaginary component. But for normalization, the important part is the absolute square, which is ψ*(x) ψ(x). So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be 1, because outside this region, the wave function must be zero, implying that the particle isn't found there, so the integral outside is zero.

Wait a minute, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for x between 1 and 3, that's one expression, and zero elsewhere. Or wait, no, the question says that none were found outside 1 < x <3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. So the given expression must be valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But in the problem, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero except in that interval, and in that interval, it's given by that function.

Wait, but the problem states: "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So that part must be where the particle exists, so probably the wave function is that expression only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But then the wave function would have to be zero outside, but the given function is non-zero in some places. So maybe the wave function is that expression between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, when x is less than 1, sqrt(1+x) is defined, but the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So the actual ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but that might complicate the normalization. Let's think about the normalization integral. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=-infty to +infty must be 1. But since the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, the integral is from 1 to 3.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i ] multiplied by its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. So when you multiply them, you get [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25), because the imaginary parts would cancel.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me denote A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), so ψ = A - 0.5i.

Then ψ* = A + 0.5i.

So |ψ|^2 = (A -0.5i)(A +0.5i) = A² + (0.5i)(A) -0.5i(A) + (0.5i)^2 (from the cross terms, but wait, wait, no. Let me multiply it out correctly.

Alternatively, (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + B², because (A-Bi)(A+Bi) = A² + ABi - ABi - (Bi)^2. The cross terms cancel, and (Bi)^2 is -B² because i² is -1. So it becomes A² + B². So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

So the integral is split into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let's compute each part.

First part: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So it becomes a² [ln(1+x)] evaluated from 1 to3. So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2) approximately? It's about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is non-zero only in the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and it must be normalized such that:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), the normalization integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \right) \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \right)
\]

Using the property \( (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A^2 + B^2 \), we find:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[ \ln(1+x) \right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
