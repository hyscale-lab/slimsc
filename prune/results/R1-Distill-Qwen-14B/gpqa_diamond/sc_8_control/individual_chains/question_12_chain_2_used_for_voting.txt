Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see what I remember about this. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest initially. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Oh wait, and neutrinos are super light, so I think their rest mass is negligible here.

Hmm, right, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta are related. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but neutrinos are almost massless, so their kinetic energy would be roughly equal to their energy, since their rest mass is negligible. But wait, in this case, the pion is decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be more than that. The neutrino's energy would be much less compared to the muon, but I'm not sure.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let's set up the equations. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². Since it's stationary, the initial momentum is zero.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. Similarly, the total momentum should be zero.

So, let's denote:

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, units. Let me get the units right. Energy is in MeV, mass is in MeV/c². So, E = sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, E is in MeV, p is in MeV/c, m is in MeV/c². So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c^2? Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1, so energy E is in MeV, momentum p in MeV/c, but since c=1, it's MeV * s/m, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe I should just use natural units where c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

Wait, yes, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the energy-momentum relation is E² = p² + m². So, for the muon, E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu².

Similarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu.

Because the total momentum is zero, p_mu = -p_nu. So, the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. Let's denote this magnitude as p.

So, total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

Because the initial energy is m_pi c², but in natural units, E_initial = m_pi.

So, m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p. So,

m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

We can solve for p here.

Let me rearrange that equation. Let me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m.

So, M = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides: M - p = sqrt(p² + m²).

Now, square both sides:

(M - p)^2 = p² + m².

Expanding the left side: M² - 2 M p + p² = p² + m².

Simplify: M² - 2 M p = m².

Then, rearrange:

-2 M p = m² - M².

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 M p = M² - m².

So, p = (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Ah, that's a formula I remember. So the momentum p is (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

M = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

m = m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So,

p = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6).

Let me compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6^2: Let me compute 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 *140*0.4 +0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So, (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So,

p = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / (2 * 139.6).

Let me compute numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Let me see, 279.2 * 29 = appr 279.2*30=8376, so 29*279.2 = 8096.8. Wait, no, 279.2 * 29 = (280 - 0.8)*29 = 280*29 = 8120 minus 0.8*29=23.2 → 8120 -23.2 = 8096.8. But 279.2 *30=8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 29.5?

Wait, maybe a better approach: 279.2 * x = 8315.67.

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 /279.2 = approx 0.784.

So x is 29.784 approximately. So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, because the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, so about 29.8 MeV.

And the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(29.784² + 105.7²).

Compute that: 29.784² is about 887, and 105.7² is 11172.49. Sum is 12059.49. Square root of that is approx 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, so 109.8 + 29.8 ≈ 139.6 MeV? Wait, 109.8 + 29.8 = 139.6, yes. So that adds up.

So, E_mu is 109.8 MeV, E_nu is 29.8 MeV.

But the question is about the kinetic energies. Because the rest energies are given.

The kinetic energy (KE) is total energy minus rest energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c² → but since we're in units where c=1, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.8 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

And KE_nu is E_nu, because the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for p. Let me compute  139.6^2 is 19488.16. 105.7^2 is (105.7)^2 = let me compute 105 *105 = 11025, 0.7 *105 *2=147, and 0.7^2=0.49. So 105.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by 2 * 139.6 → 279.2.

So 8315.67 / 279.2 = let me compute exactly.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 /279.2 = approximately 0.7835.

So p=29.7835 MeV/c ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p = 29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → let's compute.

29.784 squared: approx (30 - 0.216)^2 → 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 → 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 → 887.086.

105.7^2 = 11172.49.

Sum is 887.086 + 11172.49 = 12059.576.

Square root of 12059.576: let's see, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 → 12056.04. Hmm, which is a bit less than 12059.576.

Wait, 109.8^2 = 12056.04.

Difference: 12059.576 - 12056.04 = 3.536.

So, the square root is about 109.8 + (3.536)/(2*109.8) → 109.8 + 3.536/(219.6) ≈ 109.8 + 0.0161 → ~109.816 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.816 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV.

KE_nu is 29.784 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the energy is the rest energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(E_{\mu^+}\)) and the neutrino (\(E_\nu\)):
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. This implies:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = -p_\nu,
   \]
   meaning the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: \(|p_{\mu^+}| = |p_\nu| = p\).

### Energy-Momentum Relation
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \(E^2 = p^2 + m^2\) (in natural units where \(c = 1\)):

- For the muon:
  \[
  E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
  \]
- For the neutrino (negligible rest mass):
  \[
  E_\nu = p.
  \]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
m_{\pi^+} - p = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(m_{\pi^+} - p)^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
- \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

First, calculate \(m_{\pi^+}^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+}^2\):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]
Now compute \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
- For the neutrino:
  \[
  E_\nu = p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]
- For the muon:
  \[
  E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
  \]
  Compute \(p^2 = 29.784^2 \approx 887.086\) and \(m_{\mu^+}^2 = 11172.49\):
  \[
  E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.086 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.576} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

### Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy:
- For the muon:
  \[
  KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]
- For the neutrino:
  \[
  KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
