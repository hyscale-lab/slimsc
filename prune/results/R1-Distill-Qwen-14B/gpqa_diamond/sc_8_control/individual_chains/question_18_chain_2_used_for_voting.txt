Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. They've used the Equivalent Width (EW) method under the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption to determine the elemental abundances.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which would be [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or maybe the ratio [Si_1/Si_2]? Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's Si_1 / Si_2.

Wait, no, actually, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So Si_1/Si_2. But how?

I think I should use the given abundance ratios to find [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio (Si_1 / H_1) / (Si_2 / H_2) )? Or maybe just the ratio of the silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, considering that the hydrogen might scale with the star's overall metallicity, but wait, [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given.

Wait, let's start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. That means [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance is same as the Sun. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → nFe/nH = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

The solar nFe/nH is 1e-4.5. So for Star_1, nFe/nH is same as the Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun /nY_sun). So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

nSi/nFe for Star_1 is 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Wait, but I don't know the solar nSi. Wait, I have solar nMg and nFe.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H] for each star.

Because [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Wait, no, [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] is 0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)

But from solar, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5. And from the Sun's data, I can find nSi_sun from another ratio, perhaps.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm, maybe I should relate [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, let's tackle Star_2.

For Star_2:
[Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg abundance same as Sun. So [Mg/H] =0 → nMg/nH = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg/nSi =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)

Wait, but I need to find [Si/H] for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] =0 → Fe is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] = 0 +0.3=0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )=0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is higher than solar by 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → [Mg/H] =0 → same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H] = [Si/H] + [Mg/Si]

Wait, no. Let me think about that again. The [Mg/Si] ratio is given.

So [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg_2)/(nSi_2) ) - log( (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun) )) =0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so log(nMg_2 /nH_2) = [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

We can write nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

But [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) ) = log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) +0.3.

Substituting nMg_2 from above:

log( [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 ] / nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Taking 10^ both sides:

( (nMg_sun *nH_2) / (nH_sun *nSi_2) ) ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Simplify:

( nH_2 / nSi_2 ) = 10^0.3 * (nH_sun *nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun *nMg_sun?) Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation:

( nMg_2 / nSi_2 ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 → substitute:

( (nMg_sun *nH_2) / (nH_sun *nSi_2) ) ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Divide both sides by (nMg_sun):

( nH_2 / (nH_sun *nSi_2) ) ) =10^0.3 * (1 / nSi_sun )

Multiply both sides by nSi_2:

nH_2 /nH_sun = 10^0.3 * (nSi_2 /nSi_sun )

Then, nSi_2 /nSi_sun = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

But [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi_2/nH_2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → log( (nSi_2/nH_2) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) )

Which is log( (nSi_2 * nH_sun ) / (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) )

From the earlier equation, (nH_2 /nH_sun ) = (10^(-0.3) ) * (nSi_2 /nSi_sun )

So (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = (nH_sun /nH_2 ) * (1 / (nSi_2 /nSi_sun )) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about [Si/H]_2.

We have:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

So,

(nMg_sun *nH_2 ) / (nH_sun *nSi_2 ) ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

nH_2 / (nH_sun *nSi_2 ) =10^0.3 /nSi_sun

Multiply both sides by nSi_2:

nH_2 /nH_sun =10^0.3 * (nSi_2 /nSi_sun )

Hmm, but [Si/H]_2 is log( (nSi_2/nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = log( (nSi_2 *nH_sun ) / (nH_2 *nSi_sun) )

Let me write this as log( (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) * (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Which is log( (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) )

Which is [Si/H]_2.

But from earlier, nH_2 /nH_sun =10^0.3 * (nSi_2 /nSi_sun )

So, (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = (nH_sun /nH_2 ) * (nSi_sun /nSi_2 )

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of [Si/H].

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2.

Given that [Mg/H]_2 is 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, then [Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3.

Wait that makes sense.

Because:

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]

So [Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si]

So for Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3.

Similarly for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0, and [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

But [Fe/H] = [Fe/H], and [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

So [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3 =0.3.

So now, we have [Si/H] for both stars.

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So now, the ratio of the silicon abundances relative to hydrogen in each star.

The ratio of the silicon atoms (nSi) in Star_1 to those in Star_2 would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 )

Which is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 )

This can be written as ( (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

Wait, no, more accurately: the ratio (nSi_1) / (nSi_2 ) = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ) ] / (nSi_2 /nH_2 )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

The ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) )^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe it's better to express it as:

nSi1 /nSi2 = (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) ) * (nH2 /nH1 )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think in terms of the [Si/H] values.

We have:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log10(nSi_sun /nH_sun) } }

Wait, no. The definition is [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX_sun/nH_sun) → so log10(nX/nH) = [X/H] + log10(nX_sun/nH_sun )

So nX/nH = 10^{ [X/H] } * (nX_sun/nH_sun )

So nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Similarly, nSi_2 /nH_2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) : (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) is (10^0.3) : (10^-0.3) )

Which is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Wait, wait, no. The ratio of nSi_1/nH_1 divided by nSi_2/nH_2 is (10^0.3 /10^{-0.3}) ) =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the ratio is about 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is roughly 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, why do I think this? Because the ratio is nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) ?

Wait, no, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 is (nSi1 /nH1 ) * (nH1 /nH2) * (nH2 /nSi2 )^{-1} ), but I think a simpler way is to think in terms of nSi1 /nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2) ) × (nH2 /nH1 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again.

nSi1 /nSi2 = (nSi1 /nH1 ) * (nH1 /nH2 ) * (nH2 /nSi2 )^{-1} )

Wait, that's getting messy. Maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio (nSi1 / nH1 ) / (nSi2 / nH2 )

Which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2 ) )

But that's (nSi1 *nH2) / (nH1 *nSi2 )

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1 *nH2 ) / (nH1 *nSi2 ) = [ (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) ) ] × (nH2 /nH1 )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me plug in the numbers.

We have:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

nSi2/nH2 =10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) )= 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But that's the ratio of (nSi1/nH1 ) to (nSi2/nH2 ), which is (nSi1/nH1 ) divided by (nSi2/nH2 ), which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2 )

Which is (nSi1 *nH2 ) / (nH1 *nSi2 )

So that's the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2, scaled by the ratio of H in the two stars.

Wait, but the problem is, do the two stars have the same number of hydrogens? No, because their overall [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, but perhaps assuming that their hydrogen is the same as the Sun? Or not?

Wait, [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0. So the H in each star is same as the Sun's H.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun )

So if [Fe/H] =0, then log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun ) → nFe/nH =nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH.

So nH is the same as the Sun's nH, if [Fe/H]=0? Because nFe/nH = solar value → nFe = solar ratio * nH.

But if the star has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun, and assuming that the Sun's nH is a certain value, then the star's nH would be same as Sun's? Because nFe/nH = nFe_sun /nH_sun → if the star's nFe is same as Sun's per unit H, then nH in the star is same as Sun's.

Wait, but the star has a different mass. Does that affect the number of H atoms? Well, stars have different sizes, but the number of H atoms per unit volume (density) is what matters for abundance ratios, right? Or perhaps the question is assuming that the number densities are considered, not the total number of atoms.

So, perhaps the nH in Star_1 is the same as solar.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg/nH =nMg_sun /nH_sun → same ratio → nH in Star_2 is same as Sun's.

So, nH_1 =nH_sun, and nH_2 =nH_sun.

Thus, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 ) = (nSi1/nH_sun) / (nSi2/nH_sun ) ) = nSi1 /nSi2.

Because nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun.

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH_sun )/(nSi2/nH_sun ) )= (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) ) → which is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is about 3.9.

So the ratio is approximately 3.9, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the abundance ratios.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → Silicon-to-iron abundance ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → Magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance ratio is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → Magnesium-to-silicon abundance ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16 × 10^(-5).
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

### Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  Using [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Fe/H}]_1 + [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

- **Star_2**:
  Using [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = [\text{Mg/H}]_2 - [\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atom Densities
The ratio of silicon atom densities in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the Result
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**, which matches option **A**.
