Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphoric acid salts. Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO4^3- I think, but wait, sometimes the terminology can get confusing. Let me make sure.

The solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

So the first thing I should do is find the number of moles of each compound. Moles are calculated by mass divided by molecular weight.

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007336 moles. Wait, 1/136 is about 0.00735, so yeah, around 0.007336 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. So 1 divided by 177.99 is approximately 0.005618 moles.

Next, I think I need to consider the dissociation of these salts in water. KH2PO4 is a diprotic acid salt. Let me recall: KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but wait: Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So in solution, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, the Na2HPO4 is the disodium hydrogen phosphate, which is actually the conjugate base of H2PO4^- and the acid form is HPO4^2- in solution. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. Its first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3, which is very small).

So, if I have KH2PO4, which is K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. So that's the first deprotonated form. When this is in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become HPO4^2-, or as a base (accept a proton) to become H3PO4. But under what conditions? Well, that depends on the pH of the solution.

Similarly, Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- plus 2 Na+. So when HPO4^2- is in solution, it can either donate a proton (to become PO4^3-) or accept a proton (to become H2PO4^-). Again, the direction depends on the pH.

So when we mix these two salts into the same solution, they will affect each other's dissociation. This sounds like a buffer solution problem. Because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-), depending on the amounts.

Wait, but which is the acid and which is the base here? H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-, because HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So, in the solution, the H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (as it's a weak acid), and the HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) can accept a proton to become H2PO4^- (since it's a weak base). So the system will equilibrate, and the concentrations will adjust based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the second dissociation constant Ka2.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm. Wait, I think orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- as phosphate. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look this up mentally: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. It loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then another to become HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and another to become PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

But the problem states that we need the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3-. But wait, in the solution, given the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, is there any PO4^3- present? Because the third dissociation (HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-) is very small, as Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8). So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So maybe I'm supposed to calculate the PO4^3- concentration. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's referring to HPO4^2-.

But given that the options are in the 1e-7 range, which is lower than the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, which are in the 1e-3 M range, it's possible that they are asking for PO4^3-.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed with the analysis.

So, the solution contains:

From KH2PO4: moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007336 mol.

From Na2HPO4·2H2O: moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.

So the total volume is 0.2 L.

So initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

Now, when these two are in solution, they will set up a buffer system. The H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and the HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] at equilibrium.

Wait, but in this case, the solution is a buffer because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH will be determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate, which I'm considering as PO4^3-. So the concentration of PO4^3- would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So that's a very small value, meaning that PO4^3- is very low in concentration.

But how much of it is present?

So, the approach might be:

1. Determine the pH of the solution using the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

2. Use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

So first step: find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → let's compute that.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076? Wait, no. Wait, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, wait, no, wait. pKa is -log(Ka). So, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) ?

Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log10(Ka). So, for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 = 7.207 (since 10^(-7.207) ≈ 6.2e-8).

Wait, let me double-check: 10^(-7) is 1e-7 → 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.2e-8 is 6.2 × 1e-8, which is 6.2 × 1e-8. So 10^(-7.207) is roughly 6.2e-8, so yes, pKa2 is approximately 7.207.

So, [base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M, and [acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M.

So, the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02809 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

So, log(0.766) → since 0.766 is less than 1, the log is negative. Let me compute it: log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.766) → 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.

So the pH is approximately 7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But at pH 7.093, [H+] is 10^(-7.093) → approximately 8.27e-8 M.

Wait: pH is 7.093 → [H+] = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.093) → 1e-7 * 0.83 (since 10^0.093 ≈ 1.23, so 1/1.23 ≈ 0.813). So approx 8.13e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, but wait, wait. Wait a second. Because HPO4^2- is part of the buffer, but in the solution, some of it will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So the actual [HPO4^2-] in solution is a bit lower, but since Ka3 is so small, the dissociation is minimal. So the approximation that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02809 M may be acceptable.

So, plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.27e-8.

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.27e-8.

So, 5.056e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.056 / 8.27) * 1e-6 → approximately 0.611 * 1e-6 = 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A)6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 M

C)2.81e-7 M

D)3.97e-7 M

Hmm, 6.11e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps my approximations are a bit off.

Wait, let me re-calculate the exact steps with more precision.

First, calculate the exact pH.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M.

Ratio [base]/[acid] = 0.02809 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7666.

Log(0.7666) → Let me compute this more accurately.

Log(0.7666). Let me think: log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.7666) is between -0.114 and -0.115.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach:

Let me use natural logarithm and then convert to log, but perhaps a better way is to use the Taylor series, but maybe it's easier to just approximate.

Alternatively, I can compute it as follows.

We know that 10^0.07 = approx 1.18 → so 10^-0.07 is 0.845. Hmm, but 0.766 is between 0.845 and 0.794 (10^-0.1 is about 0.794). Wait, 10^(-0.114) is about 0.766.

Wait, because 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794, 10^(-0.11) ≈ 0.776, 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.766. So log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.

So the [H+] is 10^(-7.093) → which is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.837 → 8.37e-8 M.

Wait, 10^(-0.093) is about 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812, 10^(-0.093)= approx 0.812 * 10^(-0.003) → 0.812 * (approx 0.995) → ~0.808. So [H+] is 1e-7 * 0.808 → 8.08e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10^(-7.093) accurately. 7.093 is 7 + 0.093.

So 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

Compute 10^(-0.093):

We know that ln(10^(-0.093)) = -0.093 * ln(10) ≈ -0.093 * 2.3026 ≈ -0.214.

So e^(-0.214) ≈ 1 - 0.214 + (0.214)^2/2 - ... ≈ 0.807.

So 10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.807. So [H+]≈ 1e-7 *0.807 → 8.07e-8 M.

So, now [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.07e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 → 1.8 * 0.02809 ≈ 0.05056 → 0.05056e-12 = 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So, 5.056e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.056 /8.07) * 1e-6.

5.056 / 8.07 → approx 0.6267.

So 0.6267e-6 → 6.267e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So perhaps the answer is A.

But wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Ah! Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculation of [PO4^3-]. Because when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces H+ and PO4^3-, but the concentration of H+ is higher than in pure water, so it will affect the dissociation.

Wait, but I used the correct [H+] in the calculation. So the expression is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Yes, that's correct.

Another possible error: when calculating the initial concentrations. Let me recheck.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol → 1 / 136.09 = approximately 0.007336 mol. So 0.007336 mol in 0.2 L → 0.03668 M.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 → approx 0.005618 mol. 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

So that's correct.

Another possible point: when using the Henderson equation, did I get the ratio right? Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, base is HPO4^2- and acid is H2PO4^-.

Yes, that's correct.

So the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7666.

So log(0.7666) is approximately -0.114, so pH is 7.207 -0.114=7.093.

So [H+] is 8.07e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.07e-8 → 5.056e-14 /8.07e-8 → approximately 6.267e-7 M.

Which is about 6.27e-7, so option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Let me compute 0.02809 / 0.03668 precisely.

0.02809 / 0.03668 → let me compute this division.

0.02809 ÷ 0.03668 = ?

Let me compute 28.09 ÷ 36.68.

36.68 × 0.766 = approx 28.09? Let me see: 36.68 × 0.766 → 36.68 *0.7=25.676, 36.68 *0.06=2.2008, 36.68 *0.006=0.2201. Total ≈25.676 +2.2008=27.8768 +0.2201=28.0969. So yes, 0.766 is correct. So log(0.766) is indeed about -0.114.

Another point: when I compute [PO4^3-], I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.02809 M. But wait, some of the HPO4^2- might have dissociated into PO4^3- and H+. So the actual [HPO4^2-] would be lower. But since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible. So the approximation is valid.

Wait, let's see. The initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M. Let x be the concentration of HPO4^2- that dissociates into PO4^3- and H+. Then,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 - x ≈ 0.02809.

[PO4^3-] = x.

[H+] from this dissociation is x (since each HPO4^2- produces one H+ and one PO4^3-).

Wait, no, because the solution's H+ concentration is already determined by the buffer system (pH 7.093), which is much higher than the H+ produced by the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So, the contribution of this dissociation to [H+] is negligible, so we can ignore x in the denominator.

Thus, the previous calculation is correct.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.27e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M). But wait, perhaps I made a more precise calculation.

Let me compute the exact value.

1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = ?

0.02809 *1.8 = 0.050562 → 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14.

Divide by 8.07e-8 → 5.0562e-14 /8.07e-8 → (5.0562 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0562 / 8.07 → let me compute that.

8.07 × 0.625 = 5.04375. Which is close to 5.0562.

So 5.0562 /8.07 = approx 0.6265.

So 0.6265e-6 = 6.265e-7 M.

Which is 6.265e-7, which rounds to 6.27e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps there are some slight calculation errors due to more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact pH was a bit different because I approximated the log. Let me compute the exact pH more accurately.

The ratio is 0.02809 /0.03668 = 0.7666.

What is log(0.7666)?

Using a calculator approximation (since in reality, I don't have a calculator, but for the sake of thought, perhaps I can remember that log(0.76) is about -0.117, and log(0.77) is about -0.1115.

Wait, perhaps using linear approximation between 0.76 and 0.77.

At x=0.76, log(x)= -0.117.

At x=0.77, log(x)= -0.1115.

The difference is 0.01 in x, which causes a change in log(x) of about 0.0055.

Our x is 0.7666, which is 0.76 + 0.0066.

So the change from 0.76 to 0.7666 is 0.0066. So the change in log(x) would be (0.0066 / 0.01) * 0.0055 → 0.66 *0.0055 ≈ 0.00363.

So log(0.7666) ≈ -0.117 + 0.00363 = -0.11337. So pH = 7.207 - 0.11337 = 7.09363.

So pH is approximately 7.0936.

Then [H+] is 10^(-7.0936) → let's compute this more accurately.

Using natural logs, perhaps.

pH =7.0936 → [H+] =10^(-7.0936) = 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.0936).

Compute 10^(-0.0936):

ln(10^(-0.0936)) = -0.0936 *ln(10) ≈ -0.0936 *2.302585 ≈ -0.2155.

So e^(-0.2155) ≈ 1 -0.2155 + (0.2155^2)/2 - (0.2155^3)/6.

0.2155^2 = 0.0464 → 0.0464/2=0.0232.

0.2155^3 = 0.0464 *0.2155 ≈ 0.0100 → 0.0100/6≈0.00167.

So e^(-0.2155) ≈ 1 -0.2155 +0.0232 -0.00167 → = 0.806.

So 10^(-0.0936) = approx 0.806.

So [H+] = 1e-7 *0.806 → 8.06e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.06e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator:8.06e-8.

5.0562e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.0562 /8.06) * 1e-6.

5.0562 ÷8.06 → let's compute this division.

8.06 × 0.626 = 5.053 → which is very close to 5.0562.

So, 0.626 *8.06 = 5.053. So 5.0562 /8.06 → approximately 0.626.

So 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.

But option A is 6.24e-7. So perhaps more precise calculation would yield 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.0562 /8.06 exactly.

8.06 × 0.6265 = ?

0.6265 ×8=5.012, 0.6265 ×0.06=0.03759 → total 5.04959, which is a bit higher than 5.0562.

Wait, but 8.06 × 0.6265 = 8 *0.6265=5.012, plus 0.06 *0.6265=0.03759 → total 5.04959.

Hmm, but 5.04959 is less than 5.0562. So, to get to 5.0562:

Current quotient is 0.6265 → 8.06 × 0.6265 =5.04959.

Difference:5.0562 -5.04959 =0.00661.

So, how much more do we need to add to 0.6265 to get 0.00661 more?

Each 0.0001 increase in the quotient adds 8.06 *0.0001 =0.000806 to the product.

So, to get 0.00661, we need (0.00661 /0.000806) → approx 8.198 * 0.0001 → 0.0008198.

So the quotient is 0.6265 +0.0008198 → 0.6273198.

So, 5.0562 /8.06 = approx 0.6273.

So [PO4^3-] =0.6273e-6 →6.273e-7 M.

That's about 6.27e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7. Hmm, close but not exact. Wait perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, the initial moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol.

Let me calculate this more precisely.

177.99 g/mol → 1.00 /177.99 = approximately 0.005618 mol.

Wait, 177.99 ×0.005618 → let's see: 177.99 ×5.618e-3.

Wait, 177.99 ×5e-3 =0.88995, 177.99 ×0.618e-3= 0.11000. So total approx 0.99995 grams, which is about 1 gram, so 0.005618 mol is correct.

So, 0.005618 mol in 0.2 L → 0.02809 M.

So, that's correct.

Another point: perhaps I should consider that some of the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of KH2PO4. Wait, no, because KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, because when KH2PO4 dissociates, it gives H2PO4^-, which can then dissociate into HPO4^2-.

But in solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium. So the initial concentrations are as I calculated, and the buffer effect will adjust their concentrations.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of both salts leads to a higher concentration of HPO4^2- than calculated, but I think the initial calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O will form a buffer, and the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

Wait, yes, that's what I did. So, I think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be approximately 6.27e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M). But option D is 3.97e-7, which is half of that; perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct ion.

Wait, wait a second. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but perhaps the problem is asking for HPO4^2- instead. Because in the solution, the primary species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; PO4^3- is very low.

Wait, but the problem explicitly states orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

But if I made a mistake in that assumption, perhaps the intended answer is the concentration of HPO4^2-, which would be 0.02809 M, but that's way higher than the options provided. So it's more likely that the intended answer is PO4^3-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the buffer effect.

Wait, but no. The buffer system uses H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to find the pH, then the pH is used to find the PO4^3- concentration.

I think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the equilibrium constants provided.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007336 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \).  

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Set up the buffer system
The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), which form a buffer system. The relevant equilibrium is:  
\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{HPO₄²⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]  
The second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid is \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so:  
\[
pK_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.02809}{0.03668}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) are formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]  
The third dissociation constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to **Option A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**.
