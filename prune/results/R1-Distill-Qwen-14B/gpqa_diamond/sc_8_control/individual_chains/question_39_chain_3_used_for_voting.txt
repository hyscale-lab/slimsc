Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Hmm, normalization... right, I remember that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. So the wave function needs to be normalized.

Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that region, I think. Or wait, the problem says when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, so perhaps the wave function is zero there.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That's a complex function. So the absolute square would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Let me write that down.

The wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the square of the absolute value is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (real)^2 + (imaginary)^2.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So, substituting, the integral becomes integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function might not have any imaginary part outside the region where the particle exists. Because the problem says particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. But in the given expression, the wave function seems to be defined everywhere as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but that's confusing because if the wave function is non-zero outside the allowed region, we should set it to zero there. Or maybe the wave function as given is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but the question describes the part where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the problem statement says that when measuring, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So the wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but that's only valid between x=1 and x=3. So outside that interval, the wave function is zero. But the problem states that the given wave function is 'in a part of space where it can exist.' So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So for the normalization, we only integrate from 1 to 3.

So the integral becomes:

∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Which is:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute each part of the integral separately.

First part: ∫ [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ].

Which simplifies because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

That's 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding them together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

We need to solve for a²:

a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, so that's the answer.

To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the problem specifies that the particle is only found between \( x=1 \) and \( x=3 \). Therefore, the wave function is zero outside this region. Within \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), the wave function is non-zero, and the normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx.
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right).
   \]  
   Using \( \ln(4) = 2\ln(2) \), this simplifies to:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the numerical value of \( a \) is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
