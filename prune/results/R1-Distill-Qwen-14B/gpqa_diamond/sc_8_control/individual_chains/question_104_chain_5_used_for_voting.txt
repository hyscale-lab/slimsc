Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, which is similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

So, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The star moves a little because of the planet's gravity. When the planet is on one side, the star moves towards us, causing a blueshift (wavelength decreases), and when the planet is on the opposite side, the star moves away, causing a redshift (wavelength increases). The periodic shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The formula I'm recalling is something like:

v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the relation between the RV amplitude (K) and the orbital period. Another approach: the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (2π / P) ]^(1/3) ) * ( sin i )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune's mass is about 1/7000th of the Sun's, and the stars are like the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the equation simplifies.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) * sin i

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what they're measuring. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So K is given by:

K = [ (2π G ) / (c) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is using the formula that relates K to the orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but maybe that's not immediately helpful.

Wait, I think the key is that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or is it proportional in another way?

Wait, the formula I recall is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1, so we can ignore that. So K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) )

But wait, I think another way to express K is:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But because M_p is much smaller, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so it's approximately:

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the relation between K, the velocity, and the orbital period.

The RV method measures K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have the same mass, but the shifts are different. So, K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7. Wait, no, the shifts are 5 and 7. Wait, but I think the RV semi-amplitude is in velocity units, not in wavelength shift. So, perhaps I need to relate the wavelength shift to velocity.

The shift in wavelength can be converted to velocity using the Doppler shift formula. The formula is:

v = c * (Δλ / λ0 )

Where c is the speed of light, Δλ is the change in wavelength, and λ0 is the original wavelength.

But in this problem, we’re given the shifts as 5 milliangstroms and 7. So, assuming λ0 is the same for both (since it's the same spectral line), the velocities are proportional to the Δλ. So, K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2. So K1 = (5/7) K2.

Wait, but wait, because the shift is periodic, so the amplitude K is directly proportional to the shift in wavelength. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K1 =5, K2=7. So K1 is smaller than K2.

But in the problem, both planets have the same mass and same star mass. So, K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period? Or how does K depend on P?

I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but I can rearrange this to express P in terms of K.

Let me write the formula again. Let's assume M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So,

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3)

Let me cube both sides to eliminate the cube roots:

K^3 ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star ) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )

Rearranging for P:

P ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star ) * (2π) ) / K^3 )

Wait, no, solving for P.

Let me write:

K^3 = ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) ) * ( 2π / P ) )

So,

K^3 = ( G M_p 2π ) / ( M_star P )

Multiply both sides by P:

K^3 P = (G M_p 2π ) / M_star )

So,

P = ( G M_p 2π ) / ( M_star K^3 )

Alternatively, since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio P2/P1 would be ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ), because the other terms would cancel out.

Because, for P2/P1:

P2/P1 = [ (K1^3) / K2^3 ) ]

Wait, let me check that. Because P is inversely proportional to K^3, so if K increases, P decreases.

So, P ∝ (1/K^3 )

So, P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3 ) * P1

Wait, let's think again. Let me express P in terms of K.

From earlier,

P = ( (G M_p 2π ) / ( M_star K^3 ) )

So, P is inversely proportional to K^3, other factors being same.

So, P2 = ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) * P1

Because P is proportional to 1/K^3. So, when K increases, P decreases.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 )

Wait,

Because P2 / P1 = ( (K1^3) / (K2^3) ) )

Because P2 = ( (K1^3) / (K2^3) ) * P1

Wait, let me write P1 and P2:

P1 = (const) / K1^3

P2 = (const) / K2^3

So,

P2 / P1 = ( (1/K2^3 ) ) / (1/K1^3 ) ) = ( K1^3 ) / K2^3 )

So P2 is (K1^3 / K2^3 ) times P1.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1=5, K2=7.

So,

P2/P1 = (5^3)/(7^3) = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1.

So, if P2 is shorter, then the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, which is less than 1. So, it's about 0.36 times as long. So, planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but wait, the options have option A as ~0.36. So the answer would be that P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1, so the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, planet #2's orbital period is shorter.

But wait, the question is: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long. So the answer is A.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have gotten the ratio backward.

Another approach: Let me think about it with numbers.

Suppose K is larger, does that mean the period is shorter? Because if K increases, the star is moving faster, which suggests a shorter period. Because a shorter period means the star is moving back and forth more quickly.

So yes, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter, about 36% of planet #1's period. So, planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's.

So, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is 0.36 times P1, so the answer is approximately 0.36 and option A is ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is inversely proportional to the cube of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet and star masses are constant. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the orbital periods of planet #2 to planet #1 is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's.

The question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter, the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) is less than 1, and the closest answer is approximately 0.36.
