Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula for the mean decay distance (L) should be L = gamma * v * ctau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and ctau is the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light.

But first, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, actually, I think it's Γ = ħ τ^{-1}, so τ = ħ / Γ. Let me make sure. The natural line width is Γ, and the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so ΔE ≈ Γ. The uncertainty in time Δt is ħ / ΔE, so Δt ≈ ħ / Γ. Since τ is the mean lifetime, which is the average time, it's correct that τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

So first step: calculate the lifetime τ.

But what's the value of ħ in units that will make this calculation easier? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is a unit of energy, and seconds would be the time unit. So I can use that.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. Hmm, wait, no: 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24. Correct.

Wait, but hold on, perhaps I messed up the exponent? Let me check: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24. Yes.

Now, with the lifetime, I need to calculate the decay length. Decay length L is gamma * v * c * tau.

Wait, but wait: gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity and the rest mass. So gamma = E / (m c^2), but wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c^2. So E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E / (m c^2). But wait, the units might get a bit messy, but perhaps I can proceed with unit conversions.

Wait, but in these units, the speed of light c is often set to 1, but not in this problem. Let me think. Let me compute gamma. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E_X / m_X c². Wait, but in natural units, c is 1, so E = gamma m. But here, if I'm using units where c isn't 1, then I need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps the formula for gamma is gamma = E / (m c²). So E_X is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma = E_X/(m c²). Wait, but in the given problem, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², but wait, the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but I think in units where c=1, mass m is in GeV/c². Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1, and then convert back to regular units when needed. So, in natural units, E (in GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c² (since E=gamma m c²). So if c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/m.

So E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

But wait, in natural units, yes. So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Next, the velocity v. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Let me compute that.

Gamma is about 6.6667, so 1/gamma is about 0.15. So (1/gamma)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute (1/gamma)^2: (1/(6.6667))^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is indeed approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. The speed is 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

Wait, but let me think again. The mean lifetime is tau, so the mean decay length without any other factors would be L = v * tau. But wait, because the particle is moving, so the proper lifetime is tau, but the lab frame sees a longer lifetime (gamma times tau), so the decay length is gamma * v * tau.

Wait, no. Let me think. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = tau / gamma. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me get it right.

The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau_0). So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

But wait, the proper lifetime tau_0 is the lifetime measured in the meson's rest frame, so when the meson is not moving. The lab frame sees the meson moving, so its lifetime is longer by gamma. So the lifetime tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length is L = v * tau_lab, which is v * gamma * tau_0.

But wait, tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So tau_0 = tau / gamma? No, wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Because tau is the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, which is gamma times tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0. So tau_0 = tau / gamma.

Wait, I think I need to clarify:

In the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau_0. In the lab frame, which is moving relative to the meson, the lifetime appears longer: tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So tau_0 = tau_lab / gamma.

But in our case, we calculated tau as being in the lab frame? Or is tau in the rest frame?

Wait, earlier, we computed tau as the mean lifetime. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The width Γ is related to the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame. So Γ = ħ / tau_0. So tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

So in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So then, the decay length is L = v * tau_lab.

So putting it all together:

L = v * gamma * tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Γ, so:

L = v * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, that's getting somewhere.

But let's plug in the numbers.

First, let's compute ħ. As I mentioned earlier, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

v is approximately 0.9887c, c being 3e8 m/s.

So let me compute each part step by step.

Compute tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = (approx) 6.6667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 = (41.1375)/3 = 13.7125e-24, which is 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately. 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24:

6.6667 * 2.056875 = let's calculate:

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125

0.6667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.3709

So total is approx 13.71215e-24, which is 1.371215e-23 s.

So tau_lab is about 1.371215e-23 seconds.

Then, the decay length L = v * tau_lab.

v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.371215e-23 s.

Multiplying these together:

2.9661e8 * 1.371215e-23 = (2.9661 * 1.371215) * 1e8-23 = (approx 4.065) * 1e-15 meters.

Wait, let me compute 2.9661 * 1.371215.

2.9661 * 1.371215: Let's compute 3 * 1.371215 = 4.113645, but since it's 2.9661, which is 3 - 0.0339, so 4.113645 minus (0.0339 * 1.371215).

0.0339 * 1.371215 ≈ 0.04654. So 4.113645 - 0.04654 ≈ 4.0671.

So 4.0671e-15 meters.

Wait, that's about 4.0671e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to that. So that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should redo the calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate each step with more precise numbers.

First, compute gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... which is 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

Then, velocity v: v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98872.

Wait, 391/400 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98872, yes.

So v = 0.98872 * c, where c = 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 2.96616e8 m/s.

Now, tau_0 = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32: 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.6666667 * 2.056875:

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125

0.6666667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125

Total is 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = v * tau_lab = (2.96616e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s)

Multiply 2.96616e8 and 1.37125e-23:

2.96616 * 1.37125 = let's compute that accurately.

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425
0.96616 * 1.37125 = 

Let me compute 0.96616 * 1.37125:

First, 0.9 * 1.37125 = 1.234125
0.06 * 1.37125 = 0.082275
0.00616 * 1.37125 ≈ 0.008448.

Adding them: 1.234125 + 0.082275 = 1.3164 + 0.008448 ≈ 1.324848.

So total 2.7425 + 1.324848 ≈ 4.067348.

So 2.96616 * 1.37125 ≈ 4.067348.

So L ≈ 4.067348e(8 -23) = 4.067348e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, that's very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculations of the square root or the velocity.

Wait, perhaps I approximated v as approximately 0.9887, but more accurately, let's compute v.

Gamma is 6.6666667, so 1/gamma = 0.15.

v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute more accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) where x is small. But 0.9775 is 0.0225 less than 1. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) can be approximated as sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ (1 - 0.01125) ≈ 0.98875, but perhaps more accurately:

Let me compute 0.9775^(1/2):

I know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064= 0.976144.

Wait, 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

Let me compute 0.9887^2: 

= (0.988 + 0.0007)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 * 0.988 * 0.0007 + (0.0007)^2

= 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v = 0.98872 c.

So that's correct.

So going back, when I calculated 2.96616e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s, I get approximately 4.0673e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations of the velocity and the other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but if energy isn't the same as gamma m, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But if E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c², then gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about units more carefully. The width Γ is given in MeV, so I need to make sure all units are consistent.

In the calculation of tau_0, I have ħ in GeV·s and Γ in GeV, so the units work out to give tau in seconds.

So all the calculations are correct.

So the decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. The slight difference might be due to more precise intermediate steps or perhaps using a more accurate value for ħ.

Wait, perhaps I used ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me check the exact value. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me recompute tau_0.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 = (6.582 * 100) /32 = 658.2 /32 = 20.56875.

Yes, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 6.6666667, so tau_lab = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, v is 0.98872 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96616e8 m/s.

Multiplying v and tau_lab: 2.96616e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Let me compute 2.96616 * 1.37125 accurately.

2.96616 * 1.37125:

Let me compute 2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.96616 * 1.37125:

Compute 0.9 *1.37125 = 1.234125.

0.06 *1.37125 = 0.082275.

0.00616 *1.37125 ≈ 0.0084482.

Add them up: 1.234125 + 0.082275 = 1.3164 + 0.0084482 ≈ 1.324848.

So 2.7425 + 1.324848 = 4.067348.

So 4.067348e-15 m.

The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, so my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15. The numbers are very close, so perhaps I made a minor error in approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.96616 * 1.37125 more precisely.

Let me use a calculator-like approach.

2.96616 × 1.37125:

Breaking it down:

1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.

Compute each part:

2.96616 × 1 = 2.96616

2.96616 × 0.3 = 0.889848

2.96616 × 0.07 = 0.2076312

2.96616 × 0.00125 = 0.0037077

Now add all these:

2.96616

+0.889848 = 3.856008

+0.2076312 = 4.0636392

+0.0037077 = 4.0673469

So 4.0673469.

So 4.0673469e-15 meters.

Which is about 4.0673e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So the difference is about 0.0018e-15 m, which is 1.8e-18 m, which is negligible considering the approximations made in the calculation.

But perhaps the exact calculation gives a slightly lower number. Maybe if I used more precise values for v or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E = gamma m c². Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m. So that part is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length is c * tau * beta * gamma, where beta = v/c.

Because L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

And tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

So let me compute it as L = gamma * beta * c * (ħ / Γ).

Which can be rewritten as (gamma * beta) * (c * ħ / Γ).

Gamma * beta is (gamma) * (v/c) = gamma * (sqrt(1 -1/gamma²)) ) = sqrt(gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) )) = sqrt( gamma² -1 )

But that's another way to compute gamma * beta.

So let me compute gamma * beta.

Gamma is 6.6666667.

gamma² = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

gamma² -1 = 44.4444 -1 = 43.4444. Square root is sqrt(43.4444) ≈ 6.588.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.588.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

We have gamma=6.6666667, beta =0.98872.

So gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.98872 ≈ 6.6 * 0.98872 = let's compute 6 * 0.98872 = 5.93232, 0.6666667 *0.98872 ≈ 0.6591467. Total is approximately 6.591467.

So 6.591467.

Now, c =3e8 m/s.

So L = (gamma * beta) * (c * tau_0) = (6.591467) * (3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3*2.056875) * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Wait, no: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 m.

Which is (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8-24 m = 6.170625 * 1e-16 m = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by gamma * beta, which is approximately 6.591467.

So L ≈ 6.591467 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.591467 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.591467 *6.170625 ≈ let's approximate:

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125

0.091467 *6.170625 ≈ approx 0.563 (0.09*6.17=0.5553, 0.001467*6.17≈0.009; total ≈0.5643).

So total 3.0853125 +0.5643 =3.6496.

So total 37.02375 +3.6496 ≈40.67335.

So L ≈40.67335e-16 m =4.067335e-15 m.

Which is the same as before, approximately 4.067e-15 m. Again, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta = v/c \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta = 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we find:

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5915.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5915 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option \( B \), which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). The slight discrepancy is due to approximations in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
