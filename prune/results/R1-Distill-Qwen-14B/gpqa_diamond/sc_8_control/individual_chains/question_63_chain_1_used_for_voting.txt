Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. 

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state. They’re asking about the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Right, so the molecule must absorb a photon that provides the right amount of energy to move to the next state.

Wait, the next state—what does that mean in terms of quantum numbers? Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, each state is described by two quantum numbers: the vibrational state ν and the rotational state J. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is ν=0 and J=0, I believe. To get the next state, I guess it would require either a vibrational or rotational transition. But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve both changes in vibration and rotation.

But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, I think that would be the next higher energy state, which could be a transition from the ground state to the first excited state. Let me think about the possible options. The molecule is currently in ν=0, J=0. The next possible state would be either ν=1 or J=1. Which transition requires less energy? 

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and the energy spacing is larger than rotational. The rotational energy levels are spaced by ΔE = (ħ²/(2I)) * (J(J+1) - J(J-1)) ), but wait, I think the spacing between adjacent rotational levels is actually ΔE_rot = B*(2J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy is given by the quantum harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are E_vib = (ν + 1/2)ħω, so the spacing between adjacent vibrational levels is ħω.

So the energy to transition to the next vibrational state (ν=1) would be ħω. To transition to J=1, the energy would be something like 2B, since J goes from 0 to 1. So which is larger? If ω is 4e14 rad/s, let's compute ħω and compare it to 2B.

Wait, I need to compute B. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I c²), wait no, maybe B is ħ²/(2I), but I need to get the units right. I think B is (ħ²)/(2I R²), where I is the moment of inertia. Oh wait, no, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

So first, let me compute the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, but I need to convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.019, so μ ≈ 3.019e-27 kg. Wait, no: 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.018? Let me do it more accurately. 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, and 0.018 *1.66 is ~0.03, so total ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ R². So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I=3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is (ħ²)/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-46 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator. Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.112e-68) J²s². Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46 kg m².

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) = approx 4.606e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let's see. Actually, 1.05457e-34 squared is about (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68? Hmm, 1.05^2 is 1.1025, so yeah, 1.10e-68.

So 1.10e-68 / 2.41e-46 is about 4.56e-23 J.

Wait, but J is Joules. Let me compute the value: 1.10e-68 / 2.414e-46 = (1.10 / 2.414) * (1e-68 / 1e-46 )= approx 0.4557 * 1e-22 = 4.557e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.557e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1). So, the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_rot = B*(1*(1+1) - 0) )= 2B.

So the energy needed for that transition is 2B = 2 * 4.557e-23 J = 9.114e-23 J.

Then, the vibrational transition from ν=0 to ν=1 is E_vib = ħω. Let's compute that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s, ω is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait a minute, 4.218e-20 J is way bigger than 9.114e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the photon must have enough energy to cause the molecule to undergo the next possible transition, which would be the rotational one. Because the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, so the next possible state is the lowest energy excited state. So between the two possibilities (ν=1 and J=1), which one is lower in energy?

Because the rotational transition requires less energy, the J=1 state is lower in energy than the ν=1 state. Hmm, no, wait. The ground state is (ν=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the next lowest energy level. Since E_rot is lower than E_vib, the J=1 state comes before ν=1 in energy. So the molecule will first transition to J=1, which is a lower energy than ν=1. Therefore, the photon must provide the energy difference for this rotational transition.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state—ν=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the lowest energy higher than the ground state. So, which is lower: the first vibrational excited state (ν=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (ν=0, J=1)?

Oh, right, because the vibrational energy levels are much higher. The spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than the rotational. So the J=1 state is lower in energy than the ν=1 state. So the next state the molecule can go to is the J=1 state.

So the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference. So the photon's energy E_photon must be equal to the energy needed for the rotational transition, which is 2B.

So E_photon = 2B =9.114e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, because photons carry energy E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c).

So let me compute that. E=9.114e-23 J. c is 3e8 m/s.

p=9.114e-23 / 3e8 = 3.038e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a value like that. The options are all around e-27 or e-28. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the energy levels. Let me think again. Maybe the molecule can undergo a transition from (ν=0, J=0) to (ν=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition. Alternatively, from (ν=0, J=0) to (ν=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition.

But I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so the next state is J=1. But the options don't have the momentum I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Let me recheck the calculation of the rotational constant B.

B is (ħ²)/(2I) (in Joules). I = μ R².

μ: (20 *2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 = 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I= μ R² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ^2 is (1.05457e-34 J s)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 *1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide by (2I): 2 *1.207e-46=2.414e-46 kg m².

So B=1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is about 9.212e-23 J. So E_photon =9.212e-23 J.

Then, p=E/c =9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, none of the options are anywhere near that. Options are all about 1e-27 to 2e-27. So I must have done something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be a vibrational one, not rotational.

Wait, but why would that be? Because the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So if the rotational transition is lower in energy, why isn't that the case?

Wait, maybe the model here is a non-rigid rotor, but perhaps the question is considering the change in both vibrational and rotational states. Or perhaps I misinterpreted the model.

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So transitions can involve both rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0. The next state would be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but the energy of a state is E = E_vib + E_rot. E_vib for ν=1 is (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 +1/2)ħω = ħω. E_rot for J=1 is (1(1+1) - 0(0+1)) * B = 2B. So which is smaller, ħω or 2B?

We have ω=4e14 rad/s. So ħω=1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Earlier, I found 2B=9.11e-23 J, which is much smaller than 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the next state is J=1.

But according to the options, none of the momenta are near 3e-31 kg m/s. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps the question is about a different transition.

Wait, perhaps the model is simplified, and the transition is from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotational transitions. Because maybe for diatomic molecules, the lowest energy transition is vibration, but that doesn't make sense because the energy spacing is much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next state regardless of being vibrational or rotational, but the photon's energy would be the sum of both, but that would be even higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fundamental state, which in some cases is the lowest vibrational state with J=0, but perhaps the next state includes a change in both ν and J. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck that.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the rotational partition or some other factor. Oh, wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1 or something else. Wait, I think B is usually expressed in cm^-1 when using spectroscopic units, but in this case, I'm calculating it in Joules.

But let me think in terms of energy. Or maybe I should compute the photon's energy needed for a vibrational transition, since perhaps the question is expecting that.

Wait, the options are all around 1e-27. Let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 J s *4e14 s^-1 =4.218e-20 J.

Momentum p = E/c =4.218e-20 J /3e8 m/s =1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches. So perhaps the question expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

But why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition requires less energy and would be the next possible state.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck all the steps.

Wait, the reduced mass calculation: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg. Correct.

R=2e-10 m. Correct.

I = μ R² =3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20=1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

B= (ħ²)/(2I) = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 *1.207e-46 )

Calculate numerator: 1.05457e-34 squared is approximately 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 /2.414e-46 ≈4.606e-23 J.

So 2B=9.21e-23 J.

E_photon (rotational)=9.21e-23 J. p= E/c =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is expecting a vibrational transition. Let me see.

E_photon (vibrational) = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p_photon =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28.

But why would the question refer to the next state if the vibrational transition requires much higher energy? Because the next state (in terms of energy) is the J=1 state, which is lower in energy than the ν=1 state. So the correct transition should be the rotational one, but none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is considering only vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the molecule is in its first vibrational level but lowest rotational state, but that doesn't fit the question.

Wait, another possibility: The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. In the context of the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental vibrational state is ν=0, and the fundamental rotational state is J=0. So the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest energy would be the first possible state higher in energy than the ground state. If the rotational level requires less energy, then the photon should cause a transition to J=1, but according to our calculation, that momentum is 3e-31, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor and a simple harmonic oscillator, and the energy levels are E = νħω + (J(J+1) + J(J-1)+1)ħω, no, perhaps the energy is E = (ν + 1/2)ħω + B J (J+1). So the ground state is ν=0, J=0. The next state would be either ν=1 (E= ħω) or J=1 (E=2B). So the smallest E is 2B, so the photon's energy is 2B.

But again, the p for that is 3e-31, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the rotational partition differently. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the moment of inertia. Wait, I think B is defined as (ħ²)/(2I c²) when working in wavenumbers, but perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion between using c in m/s and other units. Let me double-check the formula for B.

In spectroscopy, the rotational constant B is often given in cm^-1, and it's related to the moment of inertia I by B = ħ²/(2I c²), where c is the speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, that might be the mistake. I think I used c in m/s, but the formula expects it in cm/s.

Yes, that's probably the error. Let me recalculate B using c in cm/s.

So, c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So I need to compute B correctly.

B = (ħ²) / (2 I c² )

Wait, but wait, I think in the formula, the moment of inertia is in g cm². Oh, right, because in spectroscopy, μ is usually in g, R in cm, so I is in g cm².

So perhaps I should convert μ and R into these units, then compute I.

Let me try that.

μ was 1.818 amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-23 g. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-23 g ≈3.018e-23 g.

Wait, no, wait: 1 amu = 1.6605e-24 grams. Because 1 gram is 1e3 kg, and 1e3 kg is 1e3 / 1.6605e-27 kg per amu. Wait, perhaps I should recompute μ in grams.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-24 grams. So μ = (20 *2)/(22) amu = 40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

So μ in grams: 1.818 *1.6605e-24 g = approx 3.018e-24 grams.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm (since 1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm).

So I = μ R² = (3.018e-24 g) * (2e-8 cm)^2.

Compute (2e-8 cm)^2 =4e-16 cm².

So I=3.018e-24 g *4e-16 cm² =1.207e-40 g cm².

Then, B = (ħ^2)/(2 I c² )

But wait, ħ is in J·s, but I need to convert units to match.

Alternatively, I can use the formula in terms of c in cm/s.

But perhaps it's easier to compute B in cm^-1.

Wait, the formula for B in cm^-1 is B = (h/(8 π² c)) * (1/(μ R²)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's easier to use the formula:

E_rot (in Joules) = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1)

But I had the correct I in kg m² earlier, so perhaps I should proceed with that.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave 2B as 9.2e-23 J, which leads to a photon momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, leading to option D.

But why would the next state be a vibrational one if the rotational one requires less energy. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem statement is implying that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, not considering rotational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule moving to the first excited state, which could be a combination of both transitions, but that's more complicated and not indicated.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B with c in cm/s.

Wait, if I calculate B as (ħ²)/(2 I c²), but I is in kg m², and c in cm/s, units may not match. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert I into g cm².

Wait, I in kg m² is 1.207e-46 kg m². To convert that to g cm²: 1 kg =1000 g, 1 m=100 cm. So 1 kg m²= (1e3 g) * (1e2 cm)^2 =1e7 g cm². So I=1.207e-46 kg m² =1.207e-46 *1e7 g cm² =1.207e-39 g cm².

Now, B = (ħ²)/(2 I c² )

But ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. In terms of erg s (cgs units), 1 J =10^7 ergs, so ħ=1.05457e-34 J s =1.05457e-34 *1e7 erg s =1.05457e-27 erg s.

c is 3e10 cm/s.

I is 1.207e-39 g cm².

So B = ( (1.05457e-27 erg s)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-39 g cm² * (3e10 cm/s)^2 )

Compute denominator:

(3e10)^2 =9e20 cm²/s².

So denominator becomes 2 *1.207e-39 *9e20 = 2 *1.207e-39 *9e20 = 2 *1.0863e-18 =2.1726e-18 g cm²/s².

Numerator: (1.05457e-27)^2 = approx 1.112e-54 erg² s².

So B = 1.112e-54 / 2.1726e-18 = approx 5.113e-37 erg cm.

Wait, B is in erg cm? That doesn't make sense. I think I'm making a mistake in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of Joules.

Wait, perhaps it's better to not get stuck on this and accept that the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational one, but the options don't match. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But why would the question not have the rotational transition's momentum as an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, ignoring the rotational transitions. Maybe the model here is considering only the vibrational transition.

In that case, the correct momentum would be E_photon = ħω =4.218e-20 J. So p= E/c ≈1.4e-28 kg m/s. Which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, corresponding to the ground state of vibration (ν=0) and rotation (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (ν=1) or a rotational transition (J=1). The energy required for these transitions is compared to identify the correct photon momentum.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
   \]
   Substituting \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}\) and \(M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The moment of inertia is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2,
   \]
   where \(R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:
   \[
   I = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant (B):**
   The rotational constant is:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I},
   \]
   where \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Substituting:
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the rotational transition from \(J=0\) to \(J=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Difference (\(\hbar \omega\)):**
   The vibrational energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \, \text{J} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum:**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c},
   \]
   where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires less energy (\(9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) compared to the vibrational transition (\(4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)). However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) does not match any of the provided options.
- The vibrational transition corresponds to a momentum of approximately \(1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}\), which matches option D.

### Conclusion:
The question likely assumes the photon causes a vibrational transition, as the rotational transition's momentum is not listed among the options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
