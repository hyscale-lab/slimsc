Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but let's try to think this through.

The question states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is a measure of the strength of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the β values here probably correspond to different complexes, maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN^- ions. So which complex is that? Let's see:

β1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^+ perhaps. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Wait, the general formula for a metal with ligands is M(L)_n. For Co(II), which is Co^2+, and SCN^- as ligand, each SCN contributes a -1 charge. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2- would have the formula [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

Wait, let's think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m, the overall charge is +2 - n*(+1 each SCN^-) = m. So m would be 2 - n. So for n=1, charge is +1 (since 2-1=1), so [Co(SCN)]^+. For n=2, 2-2=0, so neutral? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I have that backward. Let me think again. Co^2+ has +2 charge. Each SCN is -1. So each SCN adds a -1. So the complex charge is 2+ + (n*(-1)) = 2 -n. So for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+ (2-1=+1). For n=2, 2-2=0, which is neutral. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's right. Maybe it's better to not focus on the charge but the stability constants.

The question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the n=2 case. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}?

Wait, but the options for β are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the stability constant for the complex with n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4? Or maybe β1 is for the first step, and so on.

Wait, I think the stability constants are given for each successive addition of SCN^- to the cobalt ion. So β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so that's β2=40.

But wait, no, the problem refers to blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that in the case of Co complexes, the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is a blue color. Wait, wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, I think [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, but maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is more pink or something. Or perhaps in some cases, like maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ that's blue? I'm not very sure about the colors, but the question specifically mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN, so the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

Wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands, so that's the n=2 case. So if β2 is 40, and β3 is 63, then the higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the most stable is n=3 with β=63. But the question is about the dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes.

Hmm, but the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which is n=4. Because I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is blue. Let me think. I think that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. So the dithiocyanate (n=2) might not be blue. Hmm, maybe I got the question wrong. The question states "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^+ because n=2: 2*(−1) + 2^(+2) = 0? No wait, Co is +2, two SCN (−1 each) → 2−2=0. So the complex is neutral. Wait, no: Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would give a neutral complex because 2+ + 2*(−1) = 0.

So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2] and is neutral. But the color is blue? Not sure, but the question says it's blue. So regardless, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

So to find the percentage, I need to calculate the fraction that each complex contributes to the total cobalt species.

The total cobalt comes from all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

The formula for each complex's concentration can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of free ions.

Let me outline the approach:

The formation of complexes can be thought of in steps. Each step adds a ligand to the metal.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. Since the concentration of SCN- is much higher than Co (0.1 M vs 1e-2 M), the solution is in the high ligand concentration regime, so the higher-order complexes (like n=4) may be more prevalent.

But the presence of multiple stability constants complicates things because each complex can form stepwise.

Wait, but another approach is to model the system using the stability constants. The fraction of each complex can be determined based on the overall stability and the concentrations.

The total cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

But because the ligand concentration is high, the higher complexes will be more populated. But let's model it properly.

The stability constants are given as βn for each complex.

In terms of the formation of the n-th complex, the βn is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

[Co(SCN)_{n} ]^{charge} + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_{n+1} ]^{charge-1}

Wait, perhaps the β's are the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+.

β2 is for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Similarly, β3 is [Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

β4 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So each βn is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ligand.

To find the fraction of each complex, we can model the distribution of Co among the various complexes.

But this can get complicated because each step depends on the previous. But perhaps we can use the method of successive approximations or find the dominant species.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

For each complex, the fraction fn is given by:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} (β1 β2 ... βk) [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, the general formula for the fraction of the n-th complex is:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k ) )

Wait, where β0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] has no ligands, so the product is 1).

So for each n (from 0 to 4), the fraction is:

fn = ( (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, wait, no. Because each βn is the stepwise constant, the overall formation constant for the n-th complex is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the fraction of the n-th complex is:

fn = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, I think that's correct.

So in this case, the four complexes have K1=β1=9, K2=β1 β2 = 9*40=360, K3=β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680, K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute each K:

K1 = β1 =9.

K2=β1*β2=9 *40=360.

K3=β1 β2 β3=9 *40 *63= 22680.

K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=9 *40 *63 *16= 362880.

So for each n=0 to 4, the K's are:

n=0: K0=1 (no ligands), fn= [SCN]^0 * 1 / denominator.

n=1: K1=9, [SCN]^1.

n=2: K2=360, [SCN]^2.

n=3: K3=22680, [SCN]^3.

n=4: K4=362880, [SCN]^4.

The denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 ( K_n [SCN]^n )

So let's compute each term in the denominator.

Given that [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

n=0: K0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: K1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: K2 [SCN]^2=360 * (0.1)^2 =360 * 0.01=3.6.

n=3: K3 [SCN]^3=22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: K4 [SCN]^4=362880 * (0.1)^4 =362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

Plus 3.6 → 5.5.

Plus 22.68 → 28.18.

Plus 36.288 → 64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

Now compute each fn:

f0 = (1) / 64.468 ≈ 0.01551 → ~1.55%.

f1 = (9 *0.1 ) / 64.468 = 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396 →1.396%.

f2 = (360 *0.01 ) /64.468 →3.6 /64.468≈0.05556 →5.556%.

f3=22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518 →35.18%.

f4=36.288 /64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%.

So the fractions are approximately:

n=0: ~1.55%

n=1: ~1.4%

n=2: ~5.56%

n=3: ~35.18%

n=4: ~56.29%

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands, so that's n=2. So the fraction is f2 ≈5.56%, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculations or in the assumption about which complex is considered the dithiocyanato.

Wait, let me double-check the K values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So K1=9.

K2=9*40=360.

K3=9*40*63 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

K4=22680*16=362880.

Yes, those are correct.

Then the denominator: [SCN]=0.1.

n=0: 1.

n=1:9*0.1=0.9.

n=2:360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

So the fractions are:

f0 =1/64.468≈0.01551 (1.55%).

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 (1.4%).

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556 (5.55%).

f3≈22.68/64.468≈0.3518 (35.18%).

f4≈36.288/64.468≈0.5629 (56.29%).

Wait a minute, but if the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, f2 is about 5.56%, but that's not any of the options. So that suggests I might have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes, which are the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4) complexes. Because in reality, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a blue complex. So perhaps the question is referring to the tetrathiocyanato complex, not the dithiocyanato. That would align with the calculations, because f4=56.29%, which is not an option either. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps "dithiocyanato" refers to the presence of two SCN ligands, but the actual complex in question has a different stoichiometry. Or maybe the stability constants are given for different complexes.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. For example, β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. Then the calculation would be different.

If that's the case, then the approach would be to compute each complex's concentration using their respective βn and the ligand concentration.

But that complicates things more, as each complex's concentration depends on their own β and [SCN^-].

Wait, but I think the initial approach was correct, assuming stepwise β's. Because typically, stability constants are given for each step.

Wait another thought: the problem might refer to the dithiocyanato as the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is n=2, but perhaps the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution, which is f2=5.56%. But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of fractions. Let me recheck:

Denominator D=64.468.

f2=3.6 /64.468.

3.6 divided by 64.468.

Let's compute 3.6/64.468.

3.6 ÷ 64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Hmm, 5.556%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is not about n=2 but another n.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanate (two SCN) ion, but in the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex. Hmm, no, I think that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I got the β's wrong. Because the given β4 is 16, but perhaps it's a typo. Let me re-examine the β's. The user provided β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps this is an issue of the order of the β's. For example, perhaps β1 is for [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], β3 for [Co(SCN)_3], and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4], but as overall constants, not stepwise. Because in that case, the fractions would be calculated differently.

If the stability constants are overall, then the fraction of each complex is:

For each n, the fraction is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (denominator).

But then the denominator would be sum_{n=0}^4 (βn [SCN^-]^n).

Wait, but in that case, the βn's are the overall stability constants, not stepwise.

In that scenario, the approach would be:

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} has a stability constant βn.

The fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of (βm [SCN^-]^m )).

So let's try that approach.

Given β1=9 (n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4).

The denominator would be sum = β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

But wait, β0 would be 1, since the free ion has no ligands.

So sum = 1 * (0.1)^0 + 9*(0.1)^1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 *1 =1.

9*0.1=0.9.

40*0.01=0.4.

63*0.001=0.063.

16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum these: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator=2.3646.

Fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato) is β2 [SCN]^2 / sum →40*(0.01) / 2.3646 →0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169 (16.9%).

Oh wait, that's option D)16.9%.

But wait, why would the β4 be lower than β3? Because the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex's stability constant is 16, which is lower than β3=63. That would mean that [Co(SCN)_3]^- is more stable than [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. That seems unlikely, but perhaps it's correct.

But then, in this approach, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when considering stepwise β's, the fraction was about 5.5%. But with the overall approach, it's 16.9%.

So which approach is correct?

I think that the stepwise approach is more accurate because stability constants are typically given as stepwise formation constants. So the first approach would give f2≈5.5%, which is not an option. But the second approach, treating β as overall, gives 16.9%, which is an option (D).

Hmm, but why would the question present β4=16 if the stepwise approach gives it a much higher K for n=4? Because in the stepwise approach, β4 is part of K4, which is 9*40*63*16=362880. So the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex would be the most dominant, with about 56% of the total.

But the question asks for the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2, which we found to be 5.55% in the first approach and 16.9% in the second.

The options given are: A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So the only matching option from the second approach is D)16.9%.

But why the discrepancy between the two approaches? Because if the β's are given as overall stability constants, the second approach is correct. But if they are stepwise, the first approach is correct. So the problem is to determine whether the β's are stepwise or overall.

The question says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So it refers to the stability constants of the complexes, which implies that each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

Wait, no. No, the stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the metal and the ligand. So for [Co(SCN)_n], the stability constant K_n is the equilibrium constant for:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

So each K_n is an overall constant, not stepwise. So in that case, the fractions would be calculated using each K_n, not the product of stepwise β's.

So in that scenario, the fractions are as per the second approach.

So then, the fraction for each complex is:

fn = (K_n [SCN]^n) / sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN]^m )

Here, K0=1 (free Co^2+), K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but wait—no, because when we have the overall constants, for n=1: K1=9, for n=2: K2=40, etc.

So let's compute each term:

n=0: K0=1 →1*(0.1)^0=1.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum =1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator=2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

So in this case, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.

But wait, I'm confused because [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has a stability constant of 16, which is lower than [Co(SCN)_3]^-, which has K3=63. That would mean that the third complex is more stable than the fourth, which is unusual because higher ligand numbers are generally more stable when the β's are stepwise. But if the overall K for n=4 is lower than for n=3, then the fourth complex isn't as favored.

So in the solution, the dominant species would be the one with the highest K. Looking at the K's (9,40,63,16), the highest is K3=63. So the fraction for n=3 is 0.063 /2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%, which is small. But wait, that can't be right because K3 is the highest.

Wait, but wait: no, the K's are for each complex. So the [Co(SCN)_3]^- has K=63, but [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has K=16.

So in the denominator, their contributions are:

n=3: 63*(0.1)^3=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=0.0016.

So the sum is dominated by K2=40, which contributes 0.4, and K1=9 contributes 0.9, K0=1.

Wait, but K0 is 1, which is the free Co^2+. So the sum is 2.3646.

In this case, the free Co^2+ contributes the most, 1, followed by n=1 (0.9), then n=2 (0.4), then n=3 (0.063), and n=4 (0.0016).

So the dominant species is the free Co^2+ (42.25% of the total), because 1/2.3646≈0.4225 or 42.25%.

Wait, but wait, 1 is the [Co^2+] term, so that's 1/(sum) →1/2.3646≈0.4225 or 42.25%. So the free Co^2+ is the most abundant species.

But in that case, the dithiocyanato (n=2) would be 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option A is 42.3%, which would correspond to the free Co^2+.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So the answer would be option D)16.9%.

But wait, why is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex less stable than [Co(SCN)_3]^-? Because their β's are 16 and 63, respectively, but [Co(SCN)_4] has a lower K. That's a bit odd, but perhaps it's correct.

But why would the problem statement present the β's in that way? Alternatively, perhaps the β's are stepwise, not overall. Therefore, the earlier approach with K's being products of stepwise β's would apply, and the dithiocyanato fraction is around 5.5%, but that's not an option.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps the problem is using the overall K approach, and in that case, the percentage is 16.9%, making option D correct.

But another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, including those that are higher than dithiocyanato. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- as the blue one, and the dithiocyanato refers to the two SCN ligands in that complex. No, that doesn't make sense because [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has four SCN.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about what "dithiocyanato" refers to. Wait, dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands. So the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is n=2.

So in the overall approach, the fraction is 16.9% (option D), but in the stepwise approach, it's 5.5%, which isn't an option.

But the initial approach (assuming stepwise β's) gives f2=5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem treats the β's as overall K's, and the correct answer is D)16.9%.

So given that, I think the correct answer is D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, which are interpreted as the overall stability constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, respectively. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

where \( K_n = \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the \( n \)-th complex, and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The contributions to the denominator are:

- \( n = 0 \): \( K_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( K_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( K_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( K_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( K_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The denominator is the sum of these terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰, \( n = 2 \)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{K_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
