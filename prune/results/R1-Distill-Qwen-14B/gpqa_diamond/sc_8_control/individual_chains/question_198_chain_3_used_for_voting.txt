Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. A higher beta value means a more stable complex. So, the order of stability here would be β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β4 (16) > β1 (9). Wait, no, wait. Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So each beta corresponds to a different complex.

Wait, so the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^m+ where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the beta values are for each step. For example, β1 is for Co(SCN)^+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)_2^(2+), etc. Wait, but actually, the stability constant for the overall complex is the cumulative product. So the overall beta for the complex with n=4 would be β1*β2*β3*β4? Or wait, each β represents the formation of each successive ion. Let me think: the formation of the first complex Co(SCN)^(2+), the second is Co(SCN)_2^(3+), and so on. So the overall beta for each complex is the product up to that beta.

Wait, no, perhaps each beta is for the step-wise formation. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n=1 would just be β1. For n=2, the formation would be the product β1 * β2, and so on. Is that correct? Alternatively, maybe each β is the formation constant for the next step. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, with β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^3+, with β2=40, and so on. So the overall formation constants would be β_total for each complex.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me try to recall. The stability constant (formation constant) Kf for a complex is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. For example, for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+, the formation would involve adding each SCN- step by step. So the overall formation constant would be the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, for example, for the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) (n=2), the formation is in two steps:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+ ; K = β1
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+); K=β2
So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is β1 * β2.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+), it's β1 * β2 * β3, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^(4+), it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

But wait, the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the overall formation constants are:

β_total1 = β1 =9 → [CoSCN]^+
β_total2 = β1*β2= 9*40=360 → [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}
β_total3= 9*40*63=22680 → [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}
β_total4= 9*40*63*16= 362880 → [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem considers the overall K for each complex or just the given βs as the step-wise. I think the step-wise approach is that each β is the K for adding one SCN- to the previous complex. So the overall K for the n=4 complex is the product of all four βs.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} ion. Because I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is blue, while [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} is pink. So the blue one is the dithiocyanato, which is n=2.

So the problem is to find the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} among all Co-containing species.

So, the approach is to model the distribution of Co between the different complexes. We'll have all possible complexes up to n=4. But wait, in practice, the higher n complexes may not form much if the concentration of SCN- is limiting. Wait, but SCN- is 0.1 M, and Co is 1e-2 M, so the total possible is up to 4 SCN per Co, but we'll have to see.

The general approach to this problem is to consider all possible species in solution and determine their relative concentrations based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The species present will be:

1. Co^2+ (uncomplexed)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} (n=3)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} (n=4)

But also, we have to consider that the formation of these complexes depends on the availability of SCN- and the overall equilibrium. So, the distribution of Co between these complexes can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The key equation for each complex is the formation equation. Let me denote [Co^2+] as [C], [SCN^-] as [S] = 0.1 M. Then, the concentration of the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ is [C1] = β1 * [C] * [S]

Similarly, [C2] = β1 * β2 * [C] * [S]^2

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each β is the step-wise formation constant. So, the concentration of each complex is determined by the product of the previous steps.

Wait, the general expression for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+ is [Cn] = [C] * [S]^n * β1 * β2 * ... * βn

Because each step multiplies another β and another SCN-.

So, for each n, [Cn] = [C] * [S]^n * (β1 β2 ... βn)

Wait, but we have to be careful because each step is a step-wise formation. So:

[C1] = β1 [C][S]
[C2] = β1 β2 [C][S]^2
[C3] = β1 β2 β3 [C][S]^3
[C4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [C][S]^4

But wait, wait. Because the overall formation constant K for each complex is the product of the individual βs up to that step. So, for [Cn], K = β1β2...βn, and [Cn] = (K * [C][S]^n) / (activity terms for the complex ions, but assuming standard conditions, which might not be the case, but in this problem, perhaps we can ignore activity coefficients and treat them as concentrations.)

Wait, but the total concentration of all Co species is the sum of [C], [C1], [C2], [C3], [C4], and any other possible species, but I think these are the main ones.

So, the total Co concentration c(Co) is given as 1e-2 M. So,

Total Co = [C] + [C1] + [C2] + [C3] + [C4] = 1e-2

But [C] is the free Co^2+ concentration. Also, the concentration of SCN- is given as 0.1 M, but as complexes form, the free SCN- will decrease. However, if the concentration of SCN- is high enough, the complexation may proceed extensively. In this case, [S] is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than [Co^2+], which is 0.01 M. So, the amount of SCN- consumed by complexation depends on how much Co complexes.

Wait, but the problem doesn't tell us to account for the change in [S], perhaps assuming that [S] remains approximately 0.1 M. Because if the amount of Co is much less than SCN-, the change in [S] would be negligible. Let me check: c(Co) is 0.01 M, and each Co can take up to 4 SCN- ions. So the maximum possible SCN- consumed is 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M. Since the initial [S] is 0.1 M, that's 0.06 M left, which is 60% of initial. So perhaps in this problem, we can assume [S] remains approximately 0.1 M, as the consumption is not too high, so the approximation holds.

Therefore, we can take [S] =0.1 M in all the calculations for [Cn].

Now, the problem is to compute the concentrations of each complex, sum them up along with [C], and find the fraction that is [C2], which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So, let's compute each [Cn], starting with [C1], [C2], etc.

But we have [C] as a variable. Let's denote [C] as x. Then,

[C1] = β1 x [S] =9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x
[C2] = β1 β2 x [S]^2 = 9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 * x *0.01= 3.6 x
[C3] = β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 = 9*40*63 x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x
[C4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4 =9*40*63*16 x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x

Wait, let me compute each of these:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute [C1] =9 * x *0.1 =0.9 x

[C2]=9*40 *x*(0.1)^2 = 360 * x *0.01=3.6 x

[C3]=9*40*63*x*(0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 =22.68 x

[C4]= 9*40*63*16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001= 36.288 x

Wait, wait, but the exponents for [S] are correct? Because each complex has n SCN-, so [S]^n.

So, for [C3], n=3: [S]^3 = (0.1)^3=0.001.

So, all the terms are correct.

Now, the sum of all [Cn] plus [C] equals the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.

So,

x + [C1] + [C2] + [C3] + [C4] =0.01

Substituting:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x =0.01

Wait, adding all the coefficients:

x (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) =0.01

Compute the sum inside the parentheses:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So,

x *64.468 = 0.01 → x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

Wait, so x is [C] =0.0001551 M.

Now, let's compute each [Cn]:

[C1] =0.9 x ≈0.9 *0.0001551 ≈0.0001396 M

[C2]=3.6 x≈3.6 *0.0001551≈5.5836e-4 M

[C3]=22.68 x≈22.68 *0.0001551≈0.003519 M

[C4]=36.288 x≈36.288 *0.0001551≈0.00563 M

Wait, let me compute each more accurately.

Compute x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So,

[C1] = 0.9 * 0.0001551 ≈ 0.00013959 M → 1.3959e-4 M

[C2] =3.6 * 0.0001551 ≈5.5836e-4 M

[C3]=22.68 *0.0001551= approximately 0.0035185 M

[C4]=36.288 *0.0001551≈0.005634 M

Now, summing all these:

x + [C1] + [C2] + [C3] +[C4] =0.0001551 +0.00013959 +0.00055836 +0.0035185 +0.005634.

Let me add them step by step.

0.0001551 +0.00013959 =0.00029469

+0.00055836 → 0.00085305

+0.0035185 → 0.00437155

+0.005634 → 0.01000555 M. Which is approximately 0.01 M, so that checks out.

Now, the question is the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [C2].

[C2] is 5.5836e-4 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M. So the mole fraction is [C2]/(total Co).

Wait, but wait. The total Co is the sum of all [Cn] and [C], which is 0.01 M. So, the percentage is ([C2]/0.01)*100%.

[C2] is 5.5836e-4 M. So,

(5.5836e-4 / 0.01)*100% = (0.055836)*100% ≈5.5836%.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all in the 16-42% range. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, what's [C2]? I have [C2] ≈5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, 0.00055836 M is 5.5836e-4 M.

So, 5.5836e-4 divided by 0.01 is 0.055836, so 5.58% approximately. But the options are not that low. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the [Cn] expressions. Let me re-examine the setup.

Wait, I think I may have confused the step-wise βs. Let me think again: the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+ is the product of the βs up to n. So [Cn] = K_total * [C] * [S]^n, where K_total is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I used [Cn] = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [C] * [S]^n.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in my calculation, [Cn] was [C] multiplied by the product of the βs up to n, times [S]^n.

Wait, but in the calculation of [C1], it's β1 * [C][S], which is correct. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the sum of the terms. Let's compute all [Cn] with x=0.0001551:

[C1]=0.9 *x =0.9 *0.0001551=0.00013959 M.

[C2]=3.6 *0.0001551=0.00055836 M.

[C3]=22.68 *0.0001551= 0.0035185 M.

[C4]=36.288 *0.0001551=0.005634 M.

Adding all: x + [C1]+[C2]+[C3]+[C4] = 0.0001551 +0.00013959=0.00029469 → +0.00055836=0.00085305 → +0.0035185=0.00437155 → +0.005634=0.01000555 M, which is correct.

So the [C2] is approximately 0.000558 M.

So, the percentage is (0.00055836 / 0.01) *100% =5.5836%, but none of the options are that low. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the β values are the overall formation constants, not the step-wise βs. That would change everything.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But perhaps these are the overall Kf for each complex, not the step-wise βs.

Wait, this is a crucial point. If β1 is the Kf for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is Kf for [CoSCN2]^{2+}, etc., then each βn is for the n-th complex.

In that case, the formation would be:

For [CoSCN]^+ : Kf1=β1=9. So [C1]= (β1 [C][S]) / (1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + ... )

Wait, no, but in that case, the expressions for [Cn] would be different. Let me think again.

If β1 is the Kf for [CoSCN]^+ → [C1] = (β1 [C][S]) / (1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + ... )

Wait, perhaps not. It's getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this using the stability constants as the overall K for each complex.

Alternatively, maybe each β refers to the step-wise formation, so the approach I took earlier is correct. But according to that, the calculated percentage is about 5.58%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the β values are given as cumulative stability constants for each complex, not step-wise. So, for example:

[C1] = [C][S] β1

[C2] = [C][S]^2 β2

But this can't be, because β2 would then be higher than β1, which is the case here (β2=40>β1=9), but according to the step-wise approach, the overall K for [C2] would be β1*β2=360, which is higher than β3=63. So that might not make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the way the stability constants are provided is that βn is the overall Kf for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+ complex. So, for n=1, K1=β1=9; for n=2, K2=β2=40; for n=3, K3=β3=63; and for n=4, K4=β4=16.

Wait, that can't be right because K3 is higher than K2, which is higher than K1, but K4 is lower than K3. So, the most stable complex would be [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, which doesn't make sense because typically, higher n complexes are more stable.

But perhaps the given β4 is for the fourth complex, which is less stable than the third. So, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} is less stable than [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}.

But regardless, if the beta values are the overall Kf for each complex, then the approach would be different.

Let me try this approach. Let me model each complex's concentration using their respective Kf.

The general expression for each complex [Cn] is:

[Cn] = (Kf,n * [C] * [S]^n) / (1 + sum over all Kf,m [S]^m [C]^{0} )

Wait, no, the formation of each complex is independent, but considering that each complex is formed from the previous ones. So perhaps it's better to model the distribution by considering all possible complexes.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a simplified approach is to compute the fraction of each complex based on their Kf values and the concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the fraction of [C2] relative to all complexes.

Let me think: the fraction of each complex is given by (Kf,n [S]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of Kf,m [S]^m )

Where Kf,0 is 1 (for free Co^2+), Kf,1=β1=9, Kf,2=β2=40, Kf,3=β3=63, Kf,4=β4=16.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because the fraction of each species is proportional to (Kf,m [S]^m) divided by the sum of all such terms for m=0 to 4.

So, the fraction f2 of [C2] is:

f2 = (Kf,2 [S]^2) / (Kf,0 [S]^0 + Kf,1 [S]^1 + Kf,2 [S]^2 + Kf,3 [S]^3 + Kf,4 [S]^4 )

Given that Kf,0 =1, [S]=0.1 M.

So,

Numerator: Kf,2 * [S]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

Denominator:

Kf,0 [S]^0 =1*1=1

Kf,1 [S]^1=9*0.1=0.9

Kf,2 [S]^2=40 *0.01=0.4

Kf,3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

Kf,4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 →2.3

+0.063 →2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646

So, denominator is 2.3646.

f2 =0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but that's one of the options, option D: 16.9%.

But wait, earlier when I used the step-wise β approach, I got about 5.58%, but that was using the assumption that each β was step-wise, which led to a much lower [C2]. However, with this approach where each β is the overall Kf for each complex, the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, why the discrepancy? It's because the way the stability constants are interpreted is crucial.

So, if the β values are the overall Kf for each complex, then the approach I just did is correct, and the answer is 16.9%, option D.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought stability constants are usually given as step-wise. Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify: in the standard definition, the stability constant (formation constant) Kf for a complex [M L_n] is given as Kf = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So, for each n, Kf,n is the formation constant for the n-th complex.

In that case, the approach I just used is correct, because each complex's concentration is given by Kf,n [M][L]^n, and the fraction is based on those terms.

So, the correct approach is to compute each complex's contribution as Kf,n [S]^n, then sum all contributions (including the uncomplexed metal, which is Kf,0 [S]^0=1) and find the fraction of [C2].

Thus, the calculation gives f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169→16.9%.

So, the answer would be option D.

But wait, the previous approach using step-wise βs didn't account for the possibility that higher complexes are more or less stable, but perhaps the given βs are the overall Kf for each complex, which would make this approach correct.

So, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex, meaning βₙ represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2−n)+.

### Key Steps:
1. **Species in Solution**: The cobalt species present are:
   - Free Co²⁺ ([C])
   - [Co(SCN)]⁺ ([C₁])
   - [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ ([C₂])
   - [Co(SCN)₃]³⁺ ([C₃])
   - [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁺ ([C₄])

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is proportional to its formation constant multiplied by the appropriate power of the SCN⁻ concentration, normalized by the sum of all such terms:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{K_f,n \cdot [S]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_f,m \cdot [S]^m}
   \]
   Here, \(K_f,0 = 1\) (for free Co²⁺), \(K_f,1 = \beta_1 = 9\), \(K_f,2 = \beta_2 = 40\), \(K_f,3 = \beta_3 = 63\), \(K_f,4 = \beta_4 = 16\), and \([S] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\).

3. **Numerator and Denominator**:
   - **Numerator**: \(K_f,2 \cdot [S]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4\).
   - **Denominator**: Sum of all terms:
     \[
     K_f,0 \cdot [S]^0 + K_f,1 \cdot [S]^1 + K_f,2 \cdot [S]^2 + K_f,3 \cdot [S]^3 + K_f,4 \cdot [S]^4
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.01 + 63 \cdot 0.001 + 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]
   Converting to percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100\% \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.

Answer: D
