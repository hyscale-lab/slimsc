Okay, so I have this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Wait, I'm a bit confused about how parallax relates to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So parallax plx is approximately 1 over distance (in parsecs). So plx ≈ 1/r, where r is the distance.

The number of stars, N, is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh right, so it's the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance would be N/(r) which is proportional to r^4. Because r^5 divided by r is r^4. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^4. 

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

The number of stars in the region is given to vary with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we can write \( \text{plx} \approx \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This shows that the total number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. To find this, we consider the number of stars per unit distance, which is \( \frac{N}{r} \). Substituting \( N \propto r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{N}{r} \propto \frac{r^5}{r} = r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**
