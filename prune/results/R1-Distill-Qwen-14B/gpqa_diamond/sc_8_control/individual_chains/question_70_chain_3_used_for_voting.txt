Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step. 

The question is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups relate to the shapes of molecules. So first I need to figure out what E is made of.

Let's break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I need to identify what each compound is. Let's start with reaction 4 because it seems simpler. D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc., but another possibility is something like HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, H is a solvent, so perhaps it's something like ethanol or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's something like H2O, but D and B are gases. Hmm.

Wait, if D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps they form a molecule like NH3 or something. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the other reactions.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc., while weak ones are like CH3COOH or HNO2. So when C reacts with H2O, it produces two acids. That makes me think that C could be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces these acids.

Wait, when a salt of a strong acid and weak acid is hydrolyzed, maybe it produces both. For example, if C is a salt like NaHSO4, but that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, another possibility is that C is a metal sulfide. Wait, no, sulfides usually produce H2S, which is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about reaction 1. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot, suggesting maybe a stoichiometry like 1 A + 8 B → C. If B is a diatomic gas like O2, that would be 4 O2 molecules, but 8 equivalents would be 4 moles if A is 1 mole. Alternatively, perhaps B is a halogen, like Cl2. Let me think if any reactions form a compound with 8 equivalents.

Wait, another possibility: if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). Then, the reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is something else. Al typically forms Al^3+ ions. But what would react with 8 equivalents? Al has a valency of +3, so maybe 3 Al + something → product.

Alternatively, if B is O2, perhaps A is something else. Wait, maybe A is carbon. Let's see, carbon reacting with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. But that would produce CO2, but 8 O2 per C would give 8 * 2 = 16 O atoms, which doesn't make sense for a single molecule. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: product C reacts with D in reaction 2. Let me think about product E. E is extremely hazardous. So E could be something like phosgene (but that's more of a gas), or perhaps something like HCl gas, but that's not a product here. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN? Or perhaps something else.

Alternatively, maybe E is a product of a reaction that forms something like NO or SO2, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacting with water gives two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. For instance, something like MgNH4PO4 (but that's a solid) or maybe a mixed salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal sulfide, say CaS, then when it reacts with water, it might produce H2S (weak acid) and maybe another compound. Or, wait, maybe C is something like sodium sulfide (Na2S), which when hydrolyzed would produce NaOH (strong base?) but that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's see: for example, if C is NH4Cl, but that's a salt. When it reacts with water, it's just NH4+ and Cl-; but that doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester or something else. I'm not getting it yet.

Let me think about reaction 4 again. D and B form H, a solvent. If D is H2O, but B is another gas. Wait, if B is NH3, and D is HCl, then H would be NH4Cl. But that's a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a liquid like ethanol. If D is CH3CH2OH and B is something else. But that's not matching the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is NaOH, but that produces Na2CO3, which is a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3. Then, H would be NH4OH (which is NH3·H2O), but that's a weak base, not a solvent. Or maybe B is HCl and D is NaOH. Then H would be NaCl, which is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is something like H2O, but that's a solvent. But D and B are both gases. What gases react to form H2O? That would be H2 and O2, but they don't react on their own unless catalyzed. Alternatively, maybe H is another solvent, like ethanol. But I'm stuck.

Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas. Like, for example, HCN, but that's produced from reactions involving cyanide. Alternatively, maybe E is SO3, but that's a gas. Or perhaps something like NO2.

Wait, let's think about the possible substances. If C is a compound that when reacted with D (a gas) produces something like HCN, which is toxic. But I need to think about the other reactions too.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that product C is a red solid. What red solid compounds are there? One possibility is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Another is mercury(I) oxide (Hg2O), which is red. Oh, wait, mercury(I) oxide is a red solid. But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. For example, cobalt compounds can be various colors, but I'm not sure about red. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur-containing compound. Wait, sodium sulfide is white, I think.

Wait, another thought: Could C be a chromium compound? Chromium trioxide (CrO3) is orange-red, maybe. Or perhaps it's vanadium(V) oxide, which is orange. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a product of a reaction involving chlorine. Like, perhaps if A is aluminum and B is Cl2, then the reaction would form AlCl3. Aluminum chloride is white, but maybe in some forms it's colored. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe solid A is a metal, and B is a halogen. So reaction 1 is a halogenation. Let's say A is sodium (Na) and B is Cl2. Then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2. But the reaction uses 8 equivalents, so maybe the ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a higher valency. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2. Then, Fe + 3 Cl2 → FeCl3. So 1 Fe reacts with 3 Cl2, making FeCl3. But that's 3 equivalents. But the question says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is phosphorus (P4), and B is Cl2. Then, P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3. That's 6 equivalents of Cl2 per P4. But 8 is close, but not exactly. Alternatively, P reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5: P4 + 5 Cl2 → 4 PCl5. So that's 5 equivalents. Hmm, not 8.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S8) reacting with B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a different gas. Let's think about B as O2. So if A is carbon, then 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. But that's 1 equivalent O2. Not 8. Or, 2 C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2, again 3 equivalents. Not matching.

Alternatively, if B is a diatomic gas like H2. Then, reaction with A would form something like NH3 or H2O. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the products. In reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a salt that hydrolyzes into two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. Wait, but Na2SO3 would hydrolyze to NaOH and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), which is a weak acid. But F is a strong acid, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like NH4NO3. Wait, but that's ammonium nitrate, which when heated can decompose into N2O and H2O, but not sure about the reaction with water.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't do much, unless maybe in the presence of acid. But the reaction is with water alone.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think of C as a compound that when hydrolyzed produces both a strong and a weak acid. Maybe it's a mixed salt. For example, something like sodium dihydrogen phosphate, NaH2PO4. When it dissolves in water, it can dissociate into H+ (from H2PO4^-) and Na^+. But that would give only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it just dissociates into Na^+, HCO3^-, but HCO3^- can act as an acid, but again, not producing two different acids.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's say it's FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (which is not an acid). So that doesn't fit, because only a weak acid is produced.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and bicarbonate. Like, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NH4Cl. Wait, no, that's a chloride. Alternatively, if C is a metal nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. So F and G being acids doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is something like CuSO4·5H2O. But when it reacts with water, it just dissolves, but doesn't produce acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think of a compound C that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. That would mean that C has two different anions that each can form acids.

Wait, for example, if C is a salt of two different weak acids. Like, perhaps something like KAl(SO4)2. No, that's not likely to produce two different acids. Alternatively, maybe a double salt. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the hydrolysis of a salt that is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, for example, if C is NaHSO4. Then, NaHSO4 can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- in water. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H3O+). So, if C is NaHSO4, then when it reacts with water, it would produce H+ (from HSO4^-) and NaOH (a strong base). But the problem states that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is something like a diprotic acid's sodium salt. For example, if C is Na2HPO4, which is disodium hydrogen phosphate. Then, Na2HPO4 can hydrolyze in water:

Na2HPO4 + H2O ↔ 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + H2O → HPO4^2- can hydrolyze further into H2PO4^- and PO4^3-.

Wait, but that doesn't produce two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, but as gas). But F and G are acids, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and another acid. Hmm, but most metal oxides either form strong bases or weak acids. For instance, Al2O3 reacts with water to form a weak base (Al(OH)3), not acids.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. Like Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it forms NaOH and O2. But that's a base and a gas, which is an acid? O2 is a diatomic gas, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about reaction 2 again: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a gas, perhaps it's a toxic gas like HCN or SO2.

Wait, if C is a cyanide salt, then reaction with D (maybe H+) would produce HCN, which is toxic. But in reaction 3, C reacting with water gives two acids. So perhaps C is a cyanide salt, but then adding water would produce HCN (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, maybe C is NaCN. NaCN + H2O → NaOH (strong base) and HCN (weak acid). But the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that fits if F is, say, HCN (but HCN is a weak acid), but no, because F is a strong acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is something like (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it can decompose into Cr(OH)3 and ammonium hydroxide. But I'm not sure about the acids produced.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about another angle. Let's consider the reaction in step 4: D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. So D and B are gases, and their product is a solvent.

What are common solvents that are formed from the reaction of two gases? One possibility is H2O, but that requires H2 and O2, which don't react without a catalyst. Another is NH3 (ammonia), but that's a gas unless cooled. Alternatively, maybe CH3OH (methanol), but that would require CO2 and H2, which is more involved.

Wait, another possibility is HCl and NaOH reacting to form NaCl (a solid) and H2O, but that's not a gas to gas reaction. Wait, maybe D is H2O and B is NH3. Then, their reaction would require some acid to form NH4OH, but that's a weak base. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is Cl2. They could react to form HCl and S, but that's a solid. Not sure.

Another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. They can form H2O, but that's a liquid. So if H is H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1. But the question says 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe D is CO2 and B is NaOH. Then, CO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2CO3 + H2O. But that's a gas (CO2) and a solid (NaOH?), but the product is a salt and water. Hmm, not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid. But H is a solvent, so that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about H as something like ethanol. But I don't know what gases would react in a 1:1 ratio to form ethanol. Maybe ethylene oxide and water? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe H is a solution of something. Alternatively, perhaps H is a solution of NH4OH (which is a weak base), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a solution of H2SO4, but that's a liquid, not a solvent formed from a gas reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not making progress on this. Let me think about another approach: perhaps the first reaction forms a compound with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is a metal and B is a halogen, then the product C could be a halide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If A is copper (Cu) and B is chlorine (Cl2), then 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8 equivalents. Alternatively, Cu reacts with Cl2 in more equivalents: perhaps 2 Cu + 3 Cl2 → 2 CuCl3? I'm not sure if that's a real compound. Copper typically forms CuCl, CuCl2, or CuCl3^- in solution, but I'm not certain about solid forms.

Wait, another angle: the product E is extremely hazardous. Common extremely hazardous gases include phosgene (COCl2), chlorine gas (Cl2), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sarin gas, etc. But I need to think about what E could be.

If E is phosgene, then it's produced from the reaction of C with D. Phosgene is produced when carbon tetrachloride is reacted with a base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be chlorine gas, but that's the same as B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of a reaction between C and D. Let's say C is a chlorinated compound, and D is something else. For example, if C is CCl4 and D is NaOH, then they might react to produce CO2 and Cl-.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the overall picture. Maybe C is a chlorinated compound, and when it reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. So maybe C is CH2Cl2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloroalkane. For example, if C is CH3CH2Cl, then when it reacts with water, it would undergo hydrolysis to produce CH3CH2OH (ethanol, a weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). Oh! That fits the description. So in reaction 3, C (CH3CH2Cl) reacts with water to form A (maybe ethanol, but that doesn't fit because A is the starting material. Wait, no—wait, reaction 3 says C reacts with water to give back A, F, and G. So if A is ethanol, and F is HCl (strong acid) and G is maybe another acid.

Wait, but in that case, the reaction would be CH3CH2Cl + H2O → CH3CH2OH (ethanol, which is A) + HCl (F is HCl, strong acid) and what else? Wait, ethanol is a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a dihalide. For example, if C is CH2Cl2, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a chloroalkene. For example, C could be CH2=CHCl. When it hydrolyzes, it might give CH2=CH2 (ethylene, which isn't an acid) and HCl. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloroarene, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a chloro compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different chlorides. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, if C is a chloro compound that upon hydrolysis produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. For example, maybe C is a mixture of chlorides, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let me think again. If C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), then hydrolysis gives NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, but as a gas). But F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a bicarbonate. NaHCO3 reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid). But again, F is a strong acid, so perhaps this isn't it.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is HCl and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). Then, C could be a sulfite chloride. For example, Cl2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into H2SO3 and HCl. But I'm not certain if such a compound exists.

Hmm, perhaps C is Cl2SO3. Let me think about that. Cl2SO3 is an acid anhydride, and when it reacts with water, it would form H2SO3 and HCl. So, Cl2SO3 + H2O → H2SO3 + 2 HCl. So in this case, F would be HCl (strong acid) and G would be H2SO3 (weak acid). That fits the description of reaction 3.

Now, looking back at reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (Cl2SO3). So what is A and B? Let's see. Cl2SO3 could be formed from sulfur trioxide (SO3) and Cl2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps A is SO3 and B is Cl2. The reaction could be: SO3 + 4 Cl2 → Cl2SO3 + 2 Cl. But I'm not sure about the correct stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S8) and B is Cl2. Then, the reaction could be S8 + Cl2 → SCl2, but that doesn't form Cl2SO3.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between sulfur trioxide (SO3) and Cl2. Let me think about that. SO3 is a gas, but in reality, it's a liquid or solid at room temperature. But I'm not sure about their reaction.

Another approach: Let's assume that C is Cl2SO3. Then, reaction 1 is the formation of Cl2SO3 from A and B. Let's think about the elements involved. Cl2SO3 has Cl, S, and O. So A and B must supply these elements.

If B is Cl2, then A must supply S and O. So perhaps A is SO3 (sulfur trioxide) and B is Cl2. The reaction would be: SO3 + Cl2 → Cl2SO3. But what's the stoichiometry? Let's see: SO3 has 1 S, 3 O; Cl2SO3 would have 2 Cl, 1 S, 3 O. So perhaps the reaction is SO3 + 2 Cl2 → Cl2SO3 + Cl2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different combination. Maybe A is S and B is ClO2? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is H2SO4 and B is Cl2. But I'm not sure how that would form Cl2SO3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about E. E is the product of C reacting with D. If C is Cl2SO3, and D is something else. Let's say D is O2. Then, Cl2SO3 + O2 → ? Maybe oxidation to form SO4^2- or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a base. For example, if D is NaOH, then Cl2SO3 + NaOH → NaCl + NaHSO3 + H2O. But that doesn't produce a toxic gas.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3. Cl2SO3 + NH3 → ?

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O again, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps E is SO2, which is a toxic gas. How could Cl2SO3 react with something to form SO2? Maybe with a reducing agent. For example, Cl2SO3 + H2S → SO2 + other products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2S. Cl2SO3 + H2S → ?

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is a metal, but I'm stuck.

Wait, another angle: the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Symmetry groups are determined based on the molecule's structure. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. H2O is bent with C2v symmetry. SO2 has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. Cl2 has a diatomic structure with D∞h symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, its symmetry group is D∞h. If it's a bent molecule like SO2, it's C2v. If it's a linear molecule like CO2, it's D∞h. If it's a nonlinear molecule with a twofold rotation axis, perhaps C2.

Wait, but earlier I thought E might be SO2. SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is C2v. So the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, it would be D∞h, which is option B. But the question is about E's symmetry group.

But I'm not entirely certain about what E is, so I'm not sure.

Wait, going back, if C is Cl2SO3, and D is something else. Let's say D is O2. Then, perhaps C reacts with O2 to form SO3 and Cl2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas. But then D would be something that when reacted with Cl2SO3 produces HCl. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude based on the reaction data and the symmetry options.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, C2v. If it's a linear molecule, D∞h. 

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a linear structure (O=C-Cl2), but actually, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry. So its point group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is bent, then the point group is C2v.

But I'm not certain which is the correct E.

Wait, another approach. If in reaction 4, D and B form H, a solvent. Let's say H is NH3 (a solvent, though it's a gas at room temperature). Then, B and D must be something that forms NH3. For example, B could be N2 and D could be H2, but that's 3 H2 per N2, which doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, if H is H2O, then B and D would be H2 and O2. But their reaction ratio is 2:1 to form H2O, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio in reaction 4.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol). What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form methanol? Maybe CO and H2 (from syngas), but that's 1 CO and 2 H2 to form CH3OH. So that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH4OH (a weak base, but not a good solvent). Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should make an educated guess based on the information.

If the answer is the symmetry group of E, and E is a diatomic molecule, then D∞h is the symmetry group (option B). Alternatively, if it's a bent molecule, C2v (option D).

Wait, going back to the reaction: C is a bright red product. If C is HgO (mercury(I) oxide), which is red. Then, HgO (C) reacting with D (maybe Cl2) would produce HgCl2 and O2. But then E would be O2, which is diatomic, symmetry group D∞h. But O2 is a diatomic molecule, so its point group is D∞h. But then E is O2, which is a gas, but in the reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. So if D is Cl2, then HgO + Cl2 → HgCl2 + O2. But the stoichiometry would have to be correct.

Wait, HgO + Cl2 → HgCl2 + O2. Let's see: HgO has Hg and O. Cl2 is diatomic. So reaction could be 2 HgO + 4 Cl2 → 2 HgCl2 + 2 O2. So for each 2 HgO, 4 Cl2 are used. So per mole of HgO, 2 moles of Cl2. But the reaction uses 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) per mole of C (HgO). So that fits.

In this case, E is O2, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. So the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option B.

But wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So the correct answer would be B.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure what C is. Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is bent, then the symmetry group is C2v, option D.

But earlier, I thought that C might be Cl2SO3, leading E to be something else.

I'm getting a bit confused, but based on the information, I think the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry and the bright red color suggest that C could be a compound like mercury(I) oxide (HgO), which is red, or a chlorinated compound like Cl₂SO₃. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a toxic gas. If C is HgO, reacting with Cl₂ could produce HgCl₂ and O₂. O₂ is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. If C is Cl₂SO₃, reacting with a base or reducing agent could produce SO₂, a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is Cl₂SO₃, hydrolysis could yield HCl (strong acid) and H₂SO₃ (weak acid). This aligns with the description of F and G.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is H₂O, D and B could be H₂ and O₂, but their reaction ratio (2:1) does not match the 1:1 ratio described. Other possibilities for H, such as NH₃ or CH₃OH, were considered but remain uncertain.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E depends on its structure. If E is O₂ (diatomic), its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is SO₂ (bent), its symmetry group is C₂v. Based on the reactions and the possibility of E being O₂, the most likely symmetry group is D∞h.

**Conclusion**: Given the information and the reasoning, the molecular symmetry group of E is most consistent with D∞h.
