Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it travels before decaying. So, how do I find that?

I think the mean lifetime is connected to the particle's width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately ħ (hbar). So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. For a particle decaying, the uncertainty in energy is the width Γ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the mean lifetime.

So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of eV·s or something like that.

Let me calculate τ first. ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.58e-16 eV·s. Wait, maybe I should convert Γ to GeV. Oh right, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Then τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait a second, no, wait: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So dividing by 0.32 GeV gives 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, yeah.

But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetime dilated by their Lorentz gamma factor. Because the mean lifetime we calculated is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle). But when the particle is moving, from our lab frame, it's longer. So we need to multiply τ by gamma (γ) to get the observed lifetime.

So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γ * τ.

But wait, how do I find gamma? Gamma is E / (m c²), but since E is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but in this case, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. Wait, the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV.

So, gamma is E / (m c²) = E / (m), but wait, only if E and m are in compatible units. Wait, E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². Hmm, but in natural units, c=1, so E in GeV would be equivalent to m in GeV/c² multiplied by c². So in units where c=1, E = gamma * m.

Wait, perhaps I should write gamma as E_rest / E_total. No, wait. Gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy. Because gamma = (total energy) / (rest energy). So rest energy is m c², which is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

So the mean lifetime observed would be gamma * tau. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's calculate that.

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 6.6667 * 2.056875. 6 * 2 is 12, 0.6667 * 2 is 1.3334, so total about 13.3334. But let me do it accurately.

2.056875 * 6.6667 = 

Let me compute 2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6667 ≈ 2.056875 * (2/3) ≈ 1.37125.

So total ≈ 12.34125 + 1.37125 ≈ 13.7125.

So tau_lab ≈ 13.7125e-24 seconds, or 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So distance = v * tau_lab.

But what's the speed? For relativistic particles, v ≈ c, since gamma is large. But let's check if v is approximately c. Gamma is 6.6667, which is a pretty high value, so v should be very close to c. Let me compute beta (v/c). 

Beta is v/c, and we can relate it to gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is about 44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

But wait, for high gamma, beta is approximately 1, so v ≈ c.

But perhaps to get more accurate, let's compute it exactly.

Gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.66667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))). gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that.

Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, as I thought. So v = 0.9887c.

Alternatively, another approach: beta can be found via beta = (p c) / E, where p is the momentum.

Wait, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2). Since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c^2, but perhaps if we set c=1, then E in GeV, m in GeV/c², and p in GeV/c.

So E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV.

So pc = sqrt(8^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

So beta = (p c) / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV ) ≈ 0.98875.

So beta ≈ 0.9888, which matches what I found earlier.

So v ≈ 0.9888c.

So the average decay distance would be L = v * tau_lab.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute L.

L = 0.9888 * c * tau_lab.

Tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So L = 0.9888 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute that:

First, 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e8-23 = 4.11375e-15 meters.

Multiply by 0.9888: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9888 ≈ let's calculate.

4.11375 * 0.9888 ≈ approximately 4.0655 (since 4 * 0.9888 is 3.9552, and 0.11375 *0.9888≈0.1124, so total around 4.0676e-15 m).

Wait, let me compute 4.11375 * 0.9888 more accurately.

4.11375 * 0.9888:

4 * 0.9888 = 3.9552,

0.11375 * 0.9888:

0.1 * 0.9888 = 0.09888,

0.01375 * 0.9888 = approx 0.013554.

So 0.09888 + 0.013554 = 0.112434.

So total is 3.9552 + 0.112434 = 4.067634.

So L ≈ 4.0676e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 x10^-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, why the discrepancy? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Did I compute tau correctly?

Earlier, I said tau was (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

Then tau_lab is gamma times that: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-23 s.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta or gamma.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of gamma.

Gamma = E_total / E_rest = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, gamma is 6.666..., so 1/gamma is 0.15, 1/gamma^2 is 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, correct.

So L = v * tau_lab = 0.9887 * c * tau_lab.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.

So 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.067e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 meters. The options are option B: 4.0655e-15 m and option D: 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, the calculation approximates to 4.067e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So perhaps I should select option B.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of tau. Let's recalculate.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Where ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.

20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.

So 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute accurately.

2.056875e-24 * 6.666666667.

2.056875 * 6.666666667 = ?

Hmm, 2 * 6.666666667 = 13.333333334.

0.056875 * 6.666666667 = approximately 0.3791666667.

Total: 13.333333334 + 0.3791666667 ≈ 13.7125.

So tau_lab = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = v * tau_lab = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887.

Again, 4.11375 * 0.9887 = let's compute.

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548.

0.11375 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1123.

So total is 3.9548 + 0.1123 = 4.0671.

So L ≈ 4.0671e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering rounding errors in the approximations.

So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following data: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance is calculated using the relativistic lifetime of the particle, which depends on the width \( \Gamma \), the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), and the speed \( v \) of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Substituting \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m},
\]
where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the observed lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The observed lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime by:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the speed \( v \)
The speed \( v \) is determined using the relation:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}},
\]
where \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]
Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is given by:
\[
L = v \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.9887c \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}).
\]
First, calculate:
\[
3 \times 10^8 \times 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15}.
\]
Then multiply by \( 0.9887 \):
\[
L \approx 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \times 0.9887 \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:
**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
