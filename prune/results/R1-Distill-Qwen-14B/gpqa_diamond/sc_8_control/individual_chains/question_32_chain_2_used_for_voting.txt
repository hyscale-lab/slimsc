Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, what's the mass of that nucleus?

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3. So, if it's Li-6, because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons (since 3 + 3 = 6). So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed v is given as 0.96c. So, I need to calculate the total energy of the ion.

Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC" so I think it refers to the kinetic energy unless stated otherwise. Hmm, but I should double-check the formulas.

The total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by gamma * m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E - mc² = (gamma -1) mc².

But the question is about the energy of the collider. I think in colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: the RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy is given as the total energy per ion. Alternatively, sometimes the kinetic energy is what's reported. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy, including rest mass. Because when computing gamma, I'll need the rest mass energy. So let's proceed with the total energy approach.

So, first, compute gamma. v = 0.96c. So beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Let me compute (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is approx 3.5714.

But let me compute it more accurately. 0.96^2=0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Let me compute the mass. 3 * (938) + 3 * (939.565) = ?

Wait, more accurately, I should use the exact mass numbers. Alternatively, I might find the atomic mass of Li-6. Wait, I remember that the mass of a deuteron is about 1875 MeV/c², but perhaps I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So mass m = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, 938.272 *3 is about 2814.816 MeV, and 3*939.565 is about 2818.695 MeV. Adding them: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So m c² is 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, but wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So, the rest energy is 5.6335 GeV.

Then, the total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 *5.6335.

3 *5.6335 is 16.9005, 0.5714 *5.6335 is about 3.216 (since 0.5*5.6335=2.81675, 0.0714*5.6335≈0.404). So 2.81675 + 0.404 ≈ 3.22075. So 16.9005 + 3.22075 ≈ 20.12125 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately:

3.5714 * 5.6335.

Break it down:

3 *5.6335 =16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335.

Compute 0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335 = let's compute 0.07 *5.6335=0.394345, and 0.0014 *5.6335=0.0078869. So total 0.394345 + 0.0078869 = 0.4022319.

So 0.5714 *5.6335 = 2.81675 + 0.4022319 = 3.2189819.

So 16.9005 +3.2189819 =20.11948 GeV.

So approximately 20.119 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, earlier I approximated gamma as 3.5714, but let me compute it precisely.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

But wait, is 0.28 precise? Let me compute 0.96^2 again.

0.96 *0.96: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216 is 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, yes. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that's precise.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, let me calculate this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6335.

Let me do it step by step.

5.6335 *3 = 16.9005.

5.6335 * 0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7, as 4/7=0.57142857.

So 5.6335 * (4/7) = (5.6335 *4)/7.

5.6335 *4 = 22.534.

22.534 /7 ≈ 3.21914.

So adding 16.9005 +3.21914 =20.11964 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV. The options have C as 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, maybe the mass of Li-6 isn't exactly 5.6335 GeV/c². Let me think. The actual mass of a lithium-6 nucleus (which is 6Li) is approximately 5.63956 GeV/c². Wait, wait, I think I might have some confusion here. Let me double-check the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus.

Wait, I'm trying to compute the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.01714 u (atomic mass units). One atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.01714 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01714 *931.5 ≈16. So total roughly 5589 +16 = 5605 MeV, which is 5.605 GeV.

Wait, but that's the mass of the entire Li-6 atom, which includes electrons. Oh wait, no, in the nucleus, the electrons are separate. Wait, no, when we talk about the mass of the nucleus, we have to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Oh right, because the atomic mass includes electrons. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of electrons. Lithium has 3 electrons. So each electron's rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 3 electrons is about 1.533 MeV.

So, atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01714 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.01714 u - 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.01714 - 0.00164574 = 6.01549426 u.

Now, convert to GeV/c²:

6.01549426 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01549426 *931.5 MeV ≈ let's compute 0.01549426 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5 =4.6575.

0.00049426 *931.5 ≈ approx 0.461.

Adding up: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.461=14.4335.

So total nucleus mass in MeV is 5589 +14.4335 ≈5603.4335 MeV =5.6034335 GeV.

So m c² is 5.6034335 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6034335.

Let me compute that.

3 times 5.6034335 is 16.8103005.

0.57142857 times 5.6034335.

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, so 4/7 *5.6034335.

5.6034335 *4 =22.413734.

22.413734 /7 =3.201962.

So 16.8103005 +3.201962 ≈20.0122625 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.012 GeV. But earlier with the initial m c² value, I had about 20.119 GeV. Now, with a more precise mass, it's 20.012 GeV. But this is conflicting with the previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01714 u. Each electron is 0.00054858 u.

So three electrons: 3 *0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass:6.01714 -0.00164574=6.01549426 u.

Yes, that's correct. So 6.01549426 u is the nucleus mass in atomic mass units.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 6.01549426 *931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01549426 *931.5 = let me compute this accurately.

0.01549426 *931.5 = let's do 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.005=4.6575; 0.00049426 *931.5= approx 0.461.

Adding 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.461=14.4335.

So total is 5589 +14.4335=5603.4335 MeV, which is 5.6034335 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6034335.

Compute this: 5.6034335 *3.57142857.

Let me use a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.6034335.

Hmm, let's compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6034335.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 3.57142857 *5.6034335.

Compute 3*5.6034335=16.8103005.

0.57142857*5.6034335.

Wait, 5.6034335 *0.57142857.

Hmm, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

5.6034335 *4 =22.413734.

22.413734 /7=3.201962.

So 3.57142857 *5.6034335=16.8103005 +3.201962=20.0122625 GeV.

So about 20.012 GeV.

Hmm, but looking back at my earlier calculation with the initial mass, I had about 20.119 GeV, but with more accurate mass, it's about 20.012 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132, which is close to the 20.012 I have now, but there's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 -0.9216 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Because sometimes colliders report kinetic energy. So let me compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy E_kin = (gamma -1) * m c².

So gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1=2.57142857.

Then E_kin=2.57142857 *5.6034335 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *5.6034335=11.206867.

0.57142857 *5.6034335 ≈3.201962.

So total E_kin=11.206867 +3.201962=14.408829 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 14.408 GeV. But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the problem is asking for total energy. So my earlier calculation of about 20.012 GeV is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but 20.012 is about 20 GeV, and option C is 20.132, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Wait maybe I should use more precise values for the masses of proton and neutron.

Proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So mass m =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565).

938.272 *3 =2814.816 MeV.

939.565 *3=2818.695 MeV.

Total m c²=2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.633511 GeV=3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511:

Let's compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Again, 0.57142857 is 4/7, so 5.633511 *4=22.534044, divided by 7: 3.21914914.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. But my calculation gives 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Wait, but the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a small error in calculation, or perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.633511:

Break it down:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 * 0.57142857.

Let me compute 5.633511 *0.5=2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857= let's see, 0.07 *5.633511=0.39434577. 0.00142857 *5.633511≈0.0079943. So total for 0.07142857 is about 0.39434577 +0.0079943=0.40234007.

So 0.5 part is 2.8167555, 0.07142857 part is 0.40234007. Total for 0.57142857 is 2.8167555 +0.40234007=3.21909557.

So 3 *5.633511=16.900533. Adding 3.21909557 gives 20.11962857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, a discrepancy of about 0.012 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's a small difference. Maybe I should consider the exact value of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28.

But wait, perhaps the value of sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 0.28.

Wait, 0.28²=0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, so that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy per nucleon, multiplied by the number of nucleons. Let me think.

Wait, no, the nucleus's rest mass is the sum of the nucleons' rest masses adjusted for binding energy. But in the earlier calculation, I used the exact rest mass of the nucleus, which includes binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Wait, but in reality, the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. So in the first approach, when I used the sum of the individual masses (3 protons +3 neutrons), that gives a higher mass than the actual nucleus, because the actual nucleus has lower mass due to binding energy (mass defect). So when I used the atomic mass of Li-6 (which includes the mass defect), I got a lower value for m c².

Wait, which approach is correct? Because in reality, the nucleus's rest mass is given by the sum minus the binding energy (but that's accounted for in the atomic mass measurement). So when I calculated using the atomic mass (6.01714 u) and subtracted the electrons, I got a nucleus mass of 6.01549426 u which is 5.6034335 GeV.

But when I calculated using the sum of individual nucleon masses (3*(proton) +3*(neutron)), I got 5.633511 GeV.

Which is the correct value to use?

Ah, in particle physics, when considering the rest mass of a nucleus, you use the actual measured mass, which accounts for binding energy. So the correct approach is to use the measured nucleus mass, which is 5.6034 GeV.

So with that, E=3.57142857 *5.6034335 GeV=20.012 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of individual nucleon masses without considering binding energy. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is v=0.96c, but the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, let's compute the kinetic energy.

E_kin = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

m c² is 5.6034335 GeV.

So E_kin=2.57142857 *5.6034335.

Compute that:

2 *5.6034335=11.206867.

0.57142857 *5.6034335= approx 3.201962.

So E_kin=11.206867 +3.201962=14.408829 GeV.

That's about 14.408 GeV, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps the question is about the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula where the energy is in terms of the rest mass of a single nucleon, multiplied by gamma and the number of nucleons.

Wait, but the nucleus as a whole has a rest mass, not individual nucleons. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the energy per nucleon. Wait, but the options are in GeV, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons. For instance, if the energy per nucleon is (gamma m_n c²), where m_n is the neutron mass, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm not getting any of the options. So maybe I should recheck the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as the mass of the lithium atom, including electrons. But that's not the case because the nucleus's mass is without electrons.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, not accounting for binding energy. So using 3*(proton) +3*(neutron) =5.633511 GeV. Then, gamma=3.57142857.

E = 3.57142857 *5.633511 =20.1196 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV, very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But why does the option have 20.132? Let me compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Using calculator steps:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Compute 0.633511 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.033511 *3.57142857 ≈0.119346.

Adding to 2.14285714 +0.119346=2.262203.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.262203=20.11934585 GeV.

So approximately 20.1193 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, why the discrepancy? Maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to use the relativistic energy formula without considering the rest mass accurately, perhaps using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass of the deuteron or some other approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the nucleus's velocity and using the formula for kinetic energy in terms of beta and gamma.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy. So E = K + m c².

But without knowing which energy the question is referring to, it's hard. But the way the question is phrased: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In colliders, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy. RHIC's energy is given in terms of the beam energy per ion. From what I recall, RHIC's maximum energy is around 100 GeV per ion for gold ions, so 100 GeV is the total energy. But this is a different nucleus, Li-6.

But given that, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1193 GeV, possibly due to rounding differences in the mass or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the mass of a single nucleon. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for a nucleus with multiple nucleons.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the mass of the nucleus is being considered as 6 times the mass of a neutron or proton. Let's think: if the nucleus is considered as 6 nucleons, each of mass m_n.

Assuming each nucleon has mass 939.565 MeV/c², so 6 *939.565 MeV=5637.39 MeV=5.63739 GeV.

Then, gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.63739 = ?

3 *5.63739=16.91217.

0.57142857 *5.63739= let's compute 5.63739 *0.57142857.

Again, 0.57142857 is 4/7, so (5.63739 *4)=22.54956, divided by 7 is 3.2213657.

So E=16.91217 +3.2213657=20.1335 GeV.

Ah! So that's approximately 20.1335 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the approach was to consider each nucleon's rest mass as 939.565 MeV and multiply by 6, then compute gamma and get 20.133 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV.

So that makes sense. So the correct approach is to take each nucleon's mass as 939.565 MeV, sum them (3 protons +3 neutrons), compute the total rest energy, then multiply by gamma.

So the answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the nucleus and its mass**:  
   The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass of a proton is approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and the rest mass of a neutron is approximately \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).  
   The total rest energy of the nucleus is:  
   \[
   m c^2 = 3 \times (938.272) + 3 \times (939.565) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:  
   The speed of the nucleus is given as \( v = 0.96c \). The Lorentz factor is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total energy (\(E\))**:  
   The total energy of the relativistic nucleus is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma \cdot m c^2.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Breaking this calculation into parts:  
   \[
   3 \cdot 5.633511 = 16.900533, \quad 0.5714 \cdot 5.633511 \approx 3.2191.
   \]  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   E \approx 16.900533 + 3.2191 = 20.1196 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1196 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), which matches option C. The small discrepancy likely arises from rounding differences in intermediate steps or slight variations in the assumed rest masses.

**Conclusion**: The energy of the RHIC for the Li-6 nucleus moving at \( 0.96c \) is best represented by option C, \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
