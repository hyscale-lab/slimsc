Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The setup: There are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—it's three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Their host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive. Wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's. Interesting.

The question is about which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability. The options are comparing the probabilities, so I need to figure out which has a higher chance.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. Since both planets have circular orbits, maybe the alignment is similar, but the size ratio would matter.

Wait, but the probability also depends on the orbital distance. Because transits happen when the planet's orbital plane aligns with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the star's size is bigger relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_star)/(a * (1 - e^2)^0.5), but since both have circular orbits, e is zero, so it's just R_star / a. But wait, no, that's the geometric probability. Wait, the geometric probability is roughly (R_star / a), assuming R_planet << R_star, which is true for Earth-like planets.

But wait, another factor is the size of the planet compared to the star. But the question says both have the same mass, but radius? Wait, it doesn't say anything about their radii. Oh, the question says both are Earth-like, but Earth's radius is about the same as Earth's, but without knowing their exact sizes, maybe we can assume they have similar radii. Alternatively, if the stars are same radius, but the planets' distances vary, maybe that's the key.

Wait, the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance, a. Because if a planet is closer to its star, the chance of it transiting (from our line of sight) is higher. Because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned when the star is larger relative to the orbital distance.

But wait, the formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3)) )^ something... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The probability of transit (geometric probability) is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But if R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So P is proportional to R_star / a.

In this problem, R_star for both is the same. Because the host stars have the same radii. So R_star_1 = R_star_2.

So P is inversely proportional to a. Because P ~ 1/a.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. Since both planets have the same period, but different host star masses, we can find a using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) a^3. But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a^3.

So a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4π²).

So a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3).

Wait, but we have two planets. Let me write for each:

For Planet_1: a_1^3 = (G M1 P1² )/(4π²)
For Planet_2: a_2^3 = (G M2 P2² )/(4π²)

But M1 is twice M2. Because star of Planet_1 has mass twice that of Planet_2's star. Wait, let me confirm: "the star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2." So M1 = 2 M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, no, the question says orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So then a_1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )/(4π²)
a_2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2 )/(4π²)

So take the ratio a_1^3 / a_2^3 = [ (2 * (P2/3)^2) ] / [ (M2 * P2^2) ]

Wait, no. Let me compute a_1^3 / a_2^3:

a_1^3 / a_2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P1)^2 ] / [ M2 * (P2)^2 ]

But P1 is (P2)/3, so (P1)^2 = (P2)^2 /9.

So substituting:

= [2 M2 * (P2^2 /9) ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ]

The M2 and P2^2 terms cancel.

= [2 * (1/9) ] / [1 ]

= 2/9.

So a_1^3 = (2/9) a_2^3, so a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is about 2, 9 is 3^2. So 2/9 = 2/(3^2) ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close to 0.222). So a_1 is about 0.6 a_2.

So a_1 is smaller than a_2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Since R_star is same for both, P_1 ~ 1/a_1, and P_2 ~1/a_2.

So the ratio P_1 / P_2 = (R_star/a_1) / (R_star/a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

From earlier, a_1 ≈ 0.6 a_2. So a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P_1 is about 1.6667 times higher than P_2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because higher a would mean lower probability. So if a_1 is smaller than a_2, then R/a for planet_1 is higher than for planet_2, meaning higher transit probability.

So planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, let's double-check. a_1 is smaller, so R/a is bigger, so P is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2.

So which option says that Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred, 1.65x higher.

Option D says 2.7x, which is higher than our calculation.

Wait, our approximate calculation was 1.6667, which is about 1.67 times. So option C says 1.65 times, which is close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute 2/9: approximately 0.2222.

Compute cube root of 0.2222.

Since 0.6^3=0.216, which is 0.006 less than 0.2222. So maybe 0.605.

But for more precise calculation:

Let me compute 0.6^3 = 0.216.

0.605^3 = ?

0.6 *0.6 =0.36; 0.36*0.6 =0.216.

Wait, 0.605^3:

Compute 0.605 * 0.605 = approx 0.366025.

Then 0.366025 * 0.605:

Let me compute 0.366025 * 600 = 219.615, 0.366025 *5 =1.830125. So total ≈221.445125. So 0.605^3 ≈ 0.22145.

Since 0.22145 is closer to 0.2222, so 0.605^3 ≈0.22145. Difference is about 0.00075.

So let's say cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.605.

So a_1 is 0.605 a_2.

Then a_2/a_1 = 1/0.605 ≈1.6529. So about 1.65 times.

So P_1 is about 1.65 times higher than P_2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x higher.

Yes.

So researchers would choose Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), we calculate the semi-major axis for each planet. For Planet_1, the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the host star's mass is \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2M_{\text{star,2}} \). Substituting these values, we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{\text{star,2}} P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,1}} P_2^2} = \frac{M_{\text{star,2}} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{2M_{\text{star,2}} P_2^2} = \frac{1}{18}.
\]

Taking the cube root, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1}{18}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \). Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

The transit probability ratio is \( \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \). Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), we find:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
