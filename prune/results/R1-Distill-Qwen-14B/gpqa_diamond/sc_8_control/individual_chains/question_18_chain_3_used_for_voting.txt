Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass larger than our Sun: 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here, because the question is about elemental abundances based on LTE and the EW method. Oh wait, LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, and EW is Equivalent Width, which is a method to determine elemental abundances through spectral lines. So, the question is about the [X/Fe] and [X/H] values.

The given data for Star_1 is [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. For Star_2, it's [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so Si_1 / Si_2.

Wait, but I should think about what these abundance notations mean. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_Sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or maybe [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3. Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0, so log(Fe/H)_1 = log(Fe/H)_sun, which is zero. So Fe/H ratio same as the sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) +12 =7.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). Wait, but for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5, so nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5).

So the Sun's [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0, since when comparing to itself.

Wait, but in the problem, [Fe/H]_1 =0. So that means log(Fe/H)_1 - log(Fe/H)_sun =0 → log(Fe/H)_1 = log(Fe/H)_sun. So Fe/H for Star_1 is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = same as Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so Mg/H is same as Sun. So nMg2/nH2 =10^(-5).

Now, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun =0.3. So log(Si1/Fe1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3.

But Fe1/Fe_sun = (Fe1/H1 * H1/Fe_sun) / (Fe_sun/H_sun * H_sun/Fe1) ? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of log ratios.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(Si/Fe)_sun. For the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), and nSi/nH is... Wait, no, the Sun's nSi isn't given. Hmm, but perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_sun is zero.

So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(Si1/Fe1) - 0 =0.3 → log(Si1/Fe1) =0.3 → Si1/Fe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So Si1/Fe1 =10^0.3 ≈2.

But I also know that for Star_1, Fe1/H1 = Fe_sun/H_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0.

So Fe1/H1 = Fe_sun/H_sun.

So, Fe1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * H1.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me think:

nFe1/nH1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * (H_sun/H1) * (nH1/nH_sun)?

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to express in terms of the Sun's ratios. Let me denote the Sun's abundance ratios as:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = Fesun =10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun= 10^(-5).

So for Star_1:

nFe1 / nH1 = Fesun * (nH_sun / nH1) ? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_1, nFe1 = Fesun * nH1.

So Si1/Fe1 = 10^0.3 → Si1 = Fe1 * 10^0.3 → Si1 = (Fesun *nH1) * 10^0.3.

But I need to express Si1 in terms of nH1.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio Si1/Si2.

Wait, let me think about both stars.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si1/Fe1 =10^0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe1/H1 = Fe_sun / H_sun. Wait, but Fe_sun is 10^(-4.5) as nFe/nH.

Wait, nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun, so nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) ?

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think about it this way: since [Fe/H]_1=0, the ratio nFe1/nH1 is the same as nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But wait, nMg_sun /nSi_sun is a ratio we don't have. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. Do I know the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio? Since the Sun's [Mg/H] is 1e-5, but without knowing [Si/H], which isn't given, perhaps I can express it in terms of the other elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in Star_1 and [Mg/Si] in Star_2, and find a way to relate these.

Wait, the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so (nSi1)/(nSi2).

So I need to find nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2, but perhaps the H can be expressed in terms of each other. Or maybe the H is the same in both stars? No, that's unlikely; the H abundance could vary.

Wait, but both stars have different masses and possibly different H. Hmm, but I don't think the mass directly affects the ratio of elements, only the luminosity perhaps. But the question is about elemental abundances, which are ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express the silicon abundance in each star in terms of hydrogen and then take the ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = Fesun =1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi1 = 2 * nFe1 =2 * (Fesun *nH1) → nSi1 = 2 * Fesun *nH1.

So nSi1 = 2 *1e-4.5 *nH1.

Now for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2/nH2 = Mg_sun / H_sun =1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Wait, but I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm, this complicates things. Because I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 1e-5, [Fe/H] is 1e-4.5, but [Si/H] isn't provided. Hmm, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Fe and Mg in terms of H, and then find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can model each star's atmospheric composition.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the photosphere of each star as a composition where the elements' ratios are determined by the given abundance ratios.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1=0, so Fe/H is solar. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 so Si/Fe =10^0.3.

So nSi1= nFe1 * 10^0.3.

But nFe1 = Fesun *nH1 → nSi1 = Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]=0 → nMg2/nH2 = Mg_sun / H_sun.

[Mg/Si]=0.3 → nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^0.3.

So nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^0.3.

But nMg2 is also Mg_sun *nH2.

So Mg_sun *nH2 = nSi2 *10^0.3 → nSi2 = (Mg_sun *nH2) / (10^0.3).

So nSi2 = (1e-5 *nH2) / 10^0.3.

Now, the ratio of Si1 to Si2 is (nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3) ] / [ (Mg_sun *nH2) / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify that.

Fesun is 1e-4.5, Mg_sun is1e-5.

So plugging numbers:

Fesun =1e-4.5 = 3.16e-5 approx.

Mg_sun =1e-5.

So:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (3.16e-5 * nH1 * 2) ] / [ (1e-5 *nH2 ) / 2 ) ]

Wait, let me compute the constants:

Fesun =1e-4.5 = approx 3.1623e-5. So 3.16e-5.

So:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (3.16e-5 * nH1 * 10^0.3) ] / [ (1e-5 *nH2) / 10^0.3) ]

Wait, wait. Let me write it correctly.

(nSi1) = Fesun * nH1 * 10^0.3.

(nSi2) = (Mg_sun * nH2) / (10^0.3).

So the ratio is:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ Fesun * nH1 * 10^0.3 ] / [ (Mg_sun * nH2) / 10^0.3 ) ]

= [ Fesun * nH1 * 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ] / ( Mg_sun *nH2 )

= [ Fesun * nH1 *10^(0.6) ] / ( Mg_sun *nH2 )

Now, Fesun is 3.16e-5, Mg_sun is1e-5.

Substituting:

= [ (3.16e-5) * nH1 * 10^0.6 ] / [ (1e-5 ) *nH2 ]

Simplify the constants:

3.16e-5 / 1e-5 = 3.16.

So:

= 3.16 * nH1 * 10^0.6 / nH2.

Now, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, so about 4.

So:

= 3.16 *4 * (nH1/nH2)

= 12.64 * (nH1/nH2)

Hmm, but what's the ratio of nH1 and nH2?

Wait, I don't have information about the total hydrogen abundance in each star. Hmm, that complicates things. Because the problem doesn't state anything about [H], so perhaps the hydrogen is the same in both stars? Or perhaps the ratio is a certain way.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So that's nSi1/nSi2 = [ ... ] which depends on (nH1/nH2). But without knowing [H] in each star, I can't compute that.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I should think that since the question gives [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, and uses the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], perhaps the hydrogen is the same as in the Sun for both stars. But that's not necessarily the case. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, then Fe/H is the same as the Sun, meaning the same ratio of Fe to H. But the total H can vary as long as the ratio Fe/H is same. So for Star_1, the number of Fe is same as Sun relative to H, but the total H could be different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the abundance ratio, not the number density ratio. Because the number of silicon atoms would depend on the total number of hydrogen atoms, but the abundance is a ratio. Wait, but the question says 'ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres'—so nSi1/nSi2.

Hmm, I'm stuck because without knowing the ratio of H in each star, I can't proceed. But perhaps there's a way to avoid that.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogen can be considered the same for both stars. Or perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1. But that's probably not correct unless the stars have the same [H], but the question doesn't give that.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the hydrogen in each star through their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H] is zero. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] is zero, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio nH1/nH2.

Wait, but without more data, I can't compute that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen is the same in both stars, so nH1 = nH2. But that's not stated, so maybe it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is independent of nH1/nH2. Let me see.

Wait, if I write the ratio as 12.64 * (nH1/nH2), and if I can't determine (nH1/nH2), then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think again about the definitions. Because [Fe/H] is given for each star, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun. No, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe/H is same as the Sun. But the total H could be anything as long as the ratio is maintained.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplified by assuming that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars. But that seems unwarranted.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the problem is only about the abundance ratios, not the absolute number densities. So perhaps the ratio of silicon is determined by the ratios of the other elements, regardless of H. Let me think.

Wait, let me go back.

We have nSi1 = Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3.

nSi2 = (Mg_sun *nH2) / 10^0.3.

So the ratio is:

nSi1/nSi2 = [Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3] / [Mg_sun *nH2 /10^0.3]

= (Fesun / Mg_sun) * (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3)
= (Fesun / Mg_sun) * (nH1/nH2) *10^(0.6)

Fesun is 3.16e-5, Mg_sun is1e-5.

So Fesun/Mg_sun =3.16e-5 / 1e-5 =3.16.

So the ratio becomes:

3.16 * (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6 → 3.16 * (nH1/nH2) *3.98 ≈12.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But again, unless I can find (nH1/nH2), I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can find [H] in each star?

No, the given data doesn't include [H] for either star. So perhaps the question assumes that nH is the same for both stars, making nH1/nH2 = 1. But that's not stated, but perhaps that's the intended approach.

If nH1 =nH2, then nSi1/nSi2=3.16 * 1 * 3.98 ≈ 12.6.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6. So perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, why should I assume that nH is the same for both stars? The problem doesn't state that. But without any other data, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of Si is determined by the product of the [Si/Fe] and [Fe/Mg], etc., but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps think about the number of silicon atoms relative to hydrogen in each star.

In Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, [Fe/H]=0.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] =0.3 +0 =0.3 → so log(Si/H)_1 =0.3 → Si1/H1 =10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]=0.

So, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/Si] + [Mg/H] → [Si/H]_2 =0.3 +0 =0.3 → log(Si/H)_2=0.3 → Si2/H2=10^0.3.

Wait, wait, wait, is that correct? Because [X/Y] + [Y/Z] = [X/Z]?

Wait, let me think about the logarithm properties. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

But I'm not sure if [X/Y] + [Y/Z] equals [X/Z].

Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

[X/Z] = log(nX/nZ) - log(nX/nZ)_sun.

But [X/Y] + [Y/Z] = log(nX/nY) + log(nY/nZ) - (log(nX/nY)_sun + log(nY/nZ)_sun).

Which is log(nX/nZ) - log(nX/nZ)_sun = [X/Z], so yes, [X/Y] + [Y/Z] = [X/Z].

So, in Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H]=0.

So [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/Si] + [Mg/H] =0.3 +0=0.3.

So log(Si2/H2) =0.3 → Si2/H2 =10^0.3.

Similarly, in Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3 → log(Si1/H1)=0.3 → Si1/H1=10^0.3.

Wait, so in both stars, [Si/H] is 0.3.

Wait, that can't be right, because then nSi1/nH1 =nSi2/nH2 → nSi1/nSi2 =nH1/nH2.

But then the ratio of Si atoms would depend on the ratio of H atoms in each star.

But earlier, we found that [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, same as [Si/H]_2. So nSi1/nH1 =nSi2/nH2.

Which would imply that nSi1/nSi2 =nH1/nH2.

So the ratio of Si atoms is the same as the ratio of H atoms.

But without knowing how H varies between the stars, I can't determine the ratio.

Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier when I calculated nSi1/nSi2 as ~12.6 times (nH1/nH2). Hmm.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me re-express the problem.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe1/H1 = Fe_sun/H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si1/Fe1 = (Fe1/Si1)_sun^-1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, no, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(Si1/Fe1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(Si1/Fe1) =0.3 + log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5.

The Sun's nMg/nH is1e-5.

But where's the Sun's nSi/nH? It isn't provided. So perhaps I can't find [Si/Fe]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as the ratio of their solar values.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun=log(Si_sun/Fe_sun).

But without knowing Si_sun/Fe_sun, I can't compute this.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: since the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms, perhaps it's the ratio of their abundances relative to each other, regardless of H.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the H is the same in both stars.

But the question doesn't state that, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach and should think about the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is simply (10^0.3) * (10^0.3) * (Fe_sun / Mg_sun) → because Star_1 has Si/Fe higher by 10^0.3, and Star_2 has Mg/Si higher by 10^0.3, and the Fe and Mg from the Sun.

So:

Si_1 = Fe1 * 10^0.3.

But Fe1 is same as Fe_sun relative to H, so Fe1 = Fe_sun * (H1/H_sun).

Similarly, Mg2= Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun).

And in Star_2, Mg2 = Si2 *10^0.3.

So,

Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun) = Si2 *10^0.3.

So, Si2 = Mg_sun /10^0.3 * (H2/H_sun).

But then, the ratio is Si1/Si2.

Si1 = Fe_sun * H1/H_sun *10^0.3.

Si2 = Mg_sun * H2/H_sun /10^0.3.

So,

Si1/Si2 = [ Fe_sun * H1/H_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ Mg_sun * H2/H_sun /10^0.3 ]

= (Fe_sun / Mg_sun) * (H1/H2) * (10^0.3)^2.

Fe_sun is 1e-4.5, Mg_sun is1e-5.

Fe_sun/Mg_sun = (1e-4.5)/(1e-5) )=10^0.5 ≈3.162.

(10^0.3)^2 =10^0.6≈3.98.

So,

Si1/Si2 =3.162 * (H1/H2) *3.98.

= 3.162 *3.98 * (H1/H2) ≈12.6 * (H1/H2).

Again, same as before, but still depends on H ratio.

Hmm. Since the problem doesn't provide [H] for each star, perhaps the ratio is supposed to be [Si/Fe]_1 multiplied by [Fe/Mg]_sun * [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the given [Fe/H]=0 and [Mg/H]=0 implies that the H is same in each star as the Sun, but that can't be the case because [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the H and just consider the ratios.

Wait, let me think again.

If I consider that the ratio of Si in the two stars is determined by the product of their [Si/Fe] and [Fe/Mg] and [Mg/Si] etc., perhaps it's a chain.

Wait, in Star_1: [Si/Fe]=0.3.

In Star_2: [Mg/Si]=0.3.

But I need to relate these to each other via other elements.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the solar ratios are given, and we can chain the ratios together.

So, for Star_1: Si/Fe =10^0.3.

For Star_2: Mg/Si=10^0.3.

And for the Sun: Mg/Fe is known.

Wait, the Sun's nMg/nH is 1e-5, and nFe/nH is 1e-4.5.

So nMg/nFe = (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )=1e-0.5 ≈0.316.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun= log(0.316) = log(3.16e-1) ≈-0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

Now, for Star_1: [Si/Fe] =0.3, so Si/Fe =10^0.3.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si] =0.3 → Mg/Si =10^0.3.

But we can write Mg/Si = (Mg/Fe) * (Fe/Si) = (Mg/Fe) * (1/(Si/Fe)).

So:

Mg/Si = (Mg/Fe) * (1/(Si/Fe)).

Therefore,

10^0.3 = (Mg/Fe)_2 * (1/(10^0.3)).

So,

(Mg/Fe)_2 =10^0.3 *10^0.3 =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But [Mg/Fe]_2 = log(Mg/Fe)_2 - [Mg/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Fe]_2 is not given, but [Mg/Si]_2 is given.

Wait, perhaps a different approach.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → Mg/Si =10^0.3.

The solar [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(Mg_sun/Si_sun) - log(Mg_sun/Si_sun)_sun.

Wait, no, [X/Y]_sun is log(X/Y)_sun - log(X/Y)_sun → which is zero.

Wait, no, [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's the log of the ratio relative to itself.

So [Mg/Si]_sun is zero. So [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

So Mg2/Si2 =10^0.3 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

But I don't know Mg_sun/Si_sun.

But from the Sun's data: nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

nFe_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5.

But I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can write Si_sun as nSi_sun = nH_sun * 10^(-x), where x is the [Si/H]_sun.

But [Si/H]_sun is not given, so I can't proceed that way.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should accept that without the Sun's [Si/Fe], I can't proceed, but perhaps the problem gives enough information.

Wait, another approach. Let's think in terms of the number of Si atoms.

In Star_1:

nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3.

nFe1 = Fesun * nH1.

So nSi1 = Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3.

In Star_2:

nMg2 = nSi2 *10^0.3.

nMg2 = Mg_sun *nH2.

So,

Mg_sun *nH2 = nSi2 *10^0.3 → nSi2 = (Mg_sun *nH2) / 10^0.3.

Now, nSi1/nSi2 = [Fesun *nH1 *10^0.3 ] / [ Mg_sun *nH2 /10^0.3 ]

= [ Fesun / Mg_sun ] * [nH1 /nH2 ] *10^0.6.

Fesun =1e-4.5, Mg_sun=1e-5.

So Fesun/Mg_sun = (1e-4.5)/(1e-5)=10^0.5 ≈3.162.

10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So,

nSi1/nSi2≈3.162 *3.98 * (nH1/nH2) ≈12.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't find the exact ratio. Hmm.

But wait, since the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 =0, which means Fe1/H1=Fe_sun/H_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg2/H2=Mg_sun/H_sun.

But perhaps we can express the ratio of H's in terms of their masses.

Wait, but the mass of the star is given, but I don't see how that directly affects the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio ~12.6.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6. So that's probably the intended answer.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships between the elements.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(\text{Si}_1/\text{Fe}_1) = 0.3 \) → \( \text{Si}_1/\text{Fe}_1 = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \text{Fe}_1/\text{H}_1 = \text{Fe}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} \), where \( \text{Fe}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \).

   From \( \text{Si}_1 = \text{Fe}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3} \) and \( \text{Fe}_1 = \text{Fe}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_1 \), we get:
   \[
   \text{Si}_1 = \text{Fe}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}.
   \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(\text{Mg}_2/\text{Si}_2) = 0.3 \) → \( \text{Mg}_2/\text{Si}_2 = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \text{Mg}_2/\text{H}_2 = \text{Mg}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} \), where \( \text{Mg}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} = 10^{-5} \).

   From \( \text{Mg}_2 = \text{Si}_2 \cdot 10^{0.3} \) and \( \text{Mg}_2 = \text{Mg}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_2 \), we get:
   \[
   \text{Si}_2 = \frac{\text{Mg}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_2}{10^{0.3}}.
   \]

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( \text{Fe}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \),
   - \( \text{Mg}_{\odot}/\text{H}_{\odot} = 10^{-5} \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = \frac{\text{Fe}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\frac{\text{Mg}_{\odot} \cdot \text{H}_2}{10^{0.3}}}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = \frac{\text{Fe}_{\odot}}{\text{Mg}_{\odot}} \cdot \frac{\text{H}_1}{\text{H}_2} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

Substitute \( \text{Fe}_{\odot}/\text{Mg}_{\odot} = 10^{-4.5}/10^{-5} = 10^{0.5} \approx 3.16 \) and \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \):
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = 3.16 \cdot \frac{\text{H}_1}{\text{H}_2} \cdot 3.98 \approx 12.6 \cdot \frac{\text{H}_1}{\text{H}_2}.
\]

### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data on the hydrogen abundance ratio \( \text{H}_1/\text{H}_2 \). To proceed, we assume \( \text{H}_1/\text{H}_2 = 1 \), meaning the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} \approx 12.6.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
