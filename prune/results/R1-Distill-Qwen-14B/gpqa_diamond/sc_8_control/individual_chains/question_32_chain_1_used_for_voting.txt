Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so Li usually has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So the equation is E = γ * m * c². But wait, I need to calculate gamma first.

Gamma, γ, is the Lorentz factor. It's given by 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

So v = 0.96c. Let's plug that into the gamma formula:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute the denominator part first. v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Subtracting that from 1 gives 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.3^2 is 0.09, which is higher. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28.

Calculating 1 divided by 0.28: 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5=0.98, wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me check: 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.660539e-27 kg. The mass of Li-6 is 6 u, so m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27 kg.

The rest energy is m*c². c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So m*c² is 9.963234e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let's compute that.

(3e8)^2 is 9e16. So 9.963234e-27 * 9e16 = (9.963234 *9) e (-27+16) = 89.669106e-11 J. Wait, 9.963234 *9 is approximately 89.669106. So 89.669106e-11 J. But we can convert this into electron volts (eV) because the options are in GeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.60218e-19.

So 89.669106e-11 J / 1.60218e-19 eV/J = ?

Let me calculate that. 89.669106e-11 / 1.60218e-19 = (89.669106 /1.60218 ) * 1e( -11 +19 ) = (approx 56.0) * 1e8 eV. Wait, wait, let me compute 89.669106 divided by 1.60218.

Calculating 89.669 / 1.60218 ≈ 56. Because 1.60218 * 56 = approx 89.72 (since 1.60218 *50=80.109, 1.60218*6=9.613, total 89.722). So 56 *1e8 eV is 5.6e9 eV, which is 5.6 GeV.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation because I might have messed up the exponents. 9.963234e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.963234e-27 *9e16 = 8.9669106e-10 kg m²/s². Then, converting to eV: 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so 8.9669106e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (8.9669106 /1.60218) * 1e9 eV.

8.9669106 /1.60218 ≈ 5.6. So 5.6 *1e9 eV is 5.6 GeV. So the rest mass energy is about 5.6 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 *5.6 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6. 0.0714 *5.6 is approximately 0.399. So total is about 19.999 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But wait, the options have more precise values. Let me compute it more accurately.

Gamma was 3.57142857 (since 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...). Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6 exactly.

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

Adding them together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20.0 exactly. So E is 20 GeV. But wait, that seems too clean. Let me check the exact calculation of gamma and the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute the rest energy more precisely.

The mass of Li-6 is 6 u. 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m = 6 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute that.

6 *1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

Rest energy E_rest = m c².

c is 299792458 m/s, but for approximation, I used 3e8. Let me get a more precise calculation.

E_rest = 9.9632343996e-27 kg * (299792458 m/s)^2.

Wait, that's going to be a bit more accurate. But maybe I should compute the exact rest energy in GeV.

Alternatively, knowing that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, but perhaps I should compute it accurately.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c². So for a neutron, it's about the same, around 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass should be 3*(proton + neutron) in MeV/c².

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let's compute the rest mass in MeV.

Proton mass: ~938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: ~939.565 MeV/c².

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass is 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV/c².

Adding 938.272 and 939.565 gives 1877.837 MeV.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 1877.837 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps I was a bit off earlier when I used 5.6 GeV. So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

So E = γ * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6335.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0335 = let's compute that.

0.0335 *3.57142857 = 0.1192571429.

Adding all together: 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20.0 (exactly, because 3.57142857 *5.6 is 20.0). Then, adding 0.1192571429 gives 20.119257 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, 5.6335 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.0335. So:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0335 = 0.1192571429.

Adding all three: 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20.0 exactly. Then, 20.0 + 0.1192571429 ≈ 20.119257 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6335:

Another approach: 5.6335 is approximately 5.6335.

3.57142857 *5.6335: Let me compute it as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6335.

3 *5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335: 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7. Let's compute 5.6335 *4/7.

5.6335 *4 = 22.534.

22.534 /7 ≈ 3.21914.

So 16.9005 +3.21914 ≈ 20.1196.

So about 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the mass.

Wait, earlier I used the approximate proton and neutron masses, but perhaps more accurate values are needed.

Wait, the exact mass of the nucleus might be a little less due to binding energy, but maybe the problem assumes that the rest mass is simply the sum of the individual nucleons.

But let's double-check. The exact mass of Li-6: let me think. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013221496 u (from periodic table data). So perhaps using the exact mass in u is better.

So 6.013221496 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u = m.

So m = 6.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27.

Calculating that:

6.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27.

Let me compute 6 *1.6605390666e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.013221496 *1.6605390666e-27 = approximately 0.013221496 *1.6605390666e-27.

Calculating 0.013221496 *1.6605390666 ≈ 0.021963.

So 0.021963e-27 kg is 2.1963e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.9632343996e-27 + 2.1963e-29 = approximately 9.985197e-27 kg.

Then, E_rest = m c² = 9.985197e-27 kg * (3e8)^2.

Wait, but using c as 299792458 m/s would be more accurate, but that might complicate the numbers. Let's proceed with c=3e8 for simplicity.

So (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

E_rest =9.985197e-27 *9e16 = (9.985197 *9 )e (-27 +16) = 89.866773e-11 J.

Convert to eV: 89.866773e-11 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (89.866773 /1.602176634 ) * 1e8 eV.

Compute 89.866773 /1.602176634 ≈ 56.08 (because 1.602176634 *56= approx 89.72, so 56.08 would be about 56.08*1.602= 89.864, which is close).

So 56.08 *1e8 eV is 56.08 GeV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1e8 eV is 1e8 eV = 1e8 /1e9 GeV =0.1 GeV. Wait, no, wait. 1e8 eV is 100 million eV, which is 100 MeV, which is 0.1 GeV. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Let me clarify:

Wait, E_rest is 89.866773e-11 J.

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So E_rest in eV is (89.866773e-11 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) = (89.866773 /1.602176634) * 1e8 eV.

Because 1e-11 /1e-19 = 1e8.

So 89.866773 /1.602176634 ≈ 56.08.

So 56.08 *1e8 eV.

Wait, 1e8 eV is 1e8 eV = 100,000,000 eV = 1e8 eV = 1e5 *1e3 eV = 1e5 keV = 100,000 keV = 100 MeV. Wait, no, 1e8 eV is 100 million eV, which is 100 MeV.

Wait, so 56.08 *1e8 eV is 56.08 * 1e8 eV = 5608000000 eV = 5.608e9 eV = 5.608 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the sum of protons and neutrons, I got about 5.6335 GeV. So this method gives 5.608 GeV, which is a bit lower. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 6.013221496 u * 1.660539e-27 kg/u = 6.013221496 *1.660539 = Let me compute that more accurately.

6 *1.660539 =9.963234.

0.013221496 *1.660539 ≈ 0.021959.

So total is 9.963234 +0.021959 =9.985193e-27 kg. Which is correct.

Then, E_rest = 9.985193e-27 kg * (3e8)^2.

(3e8)^2 =9e16.

So 9.985193e-27 *9e16 = 89.866737e-11 J.

Convert to eV:

89.866737e-11 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (89.866737 /1.602176634) * 1e8 eV.

Compute 89.866737 /1.602176634.

Let me compute 1.602176634 * 56 = 89.721487. 56 *1.602176634 = 89.721487.

89.866737 -89.721487 =0.14525.

So 56 + (0.14525 /1.602176634) → 0.14525 /1.602 ≈0.0906.

So approximately 56.0906.

So 56.0906 *1e8 eV =5.60906e9 eV =5.60906 GeV.

So E_rest is approximately 5.60906 GeV.

Then the total energy E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.60906 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60906.

Break it down:

3 *5.60906 =16.82718

0.57142857 *5.60906 ≈ let's compute 5.60906 *0.5 is 2.80453, and 5.60906 *0.07142857 ≈ 0.3993.

So 2.80453 +0.3993 ≈3.20383.

Adding 16.82718 +3.20383 =20.03101 GeV.

So about 20.031 GeV. So the energy is approximately 20.031 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, our calculation is about 20.03 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. So why the discrepancy? Did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of gamma.

Earlier, I approximated gamma as 3.57142857, but perhaps the exact value is needed.

v =0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1-v²/c²=1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more accurately 6.013221496 u, which I used. So let's compute E_rest more accurately.

E_rest = m c² where m is 6.013221496 u.

So m =6.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute m:

6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27 =?

Compute 0.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27:

0.013221496 *1.66053906660 = let me compute that precisely.

0.013221496 *1.66053906660 ≈ 0.021959.

So m is 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.021959e-27 =9.9851933996e-27 kg.

Then, E_rest = m c^2 =9.9851933996e-27 kg * (299792458)^2.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise value of c would help, but that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E_rest in GeV using the exact u value and known conversion factors.

Wait, I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013221496 u is 6.013221496 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013221496 *931.5 ≈12.333 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.333=5601.333 MeV, which is 5.601333 GeV.

Ah, that's a bit more precise. So E_rest ≈5.601333 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.601333 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.601333.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285 GeV.

3.57142857 *0.601333 =?

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.001333 *3.57142857 ≈0.004756.

So 2.14285714 +0.004756 ≈2.147613.

Adding to the 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.147613 ≈20.004756 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.005 GeV. So why is the option C 20.132 GeV? That's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.601333 more precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.601333:

=3.57142857 * (5 + 0.601333)

=3.57142857 *5 + 3.57142857 *0.601333.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.601333:

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.001333 ≈0.004756.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.004756 =2.147613.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.147613 =20.00475585 GeV.

So approximately 20.004756 GeV. So about 20.005 GeV.

But the options don't have an option close to 20 GeV except option C (20.132 GeV) and option A (18.475), which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, 1u =931.4940641 MeV/c².

So for 6.013221496 u, it's 6.013221496 *931.4940641 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.4940641 =5588.9643846 MeV.

0.013221496 *931.4940641 = approx 12.333 MeV.

So total is 5588.9643846 +12.333 =5601.2973846 MeV, which is 5.6012973846 GeV.

So E_rest =5.601297 GeV.

Then, E =3.57142857 *5.601297 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601297.

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.601297.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.001297 ≈0.004643.

So 2.142857142 +0.004643 ≈2.147499.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.004641 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0046 GeV.

This suggests the energy is approximately 20.0046 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c, but maybe the speed is 0.96c, but the calculation of gamma requires more precise computation.

Wait, let me double-check gamma:

v =0.96c.

v²/c²=0.96²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But wait, 0.28 is actually 28/100 =7/25. So 1/(sqrt(0.0784))=1/(0.28)=3.57142857 exactly.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest more accurately, using exact u and exact c.

Let me compute E_rest again, using exact values.

E_rest = Li-6 mass * c² in GeV.

Li-6 mass is 6.013221496 u.

1 u =931.4940641 MeV/c².

So E_rest =6.013221496 *931.4940641 MeV.

Compute this:

6 *931.4940641 =5588.9643846 MeV.

0.013221496 *931.4940641 = let me compute that.

0.01 *931.4940641=9.314940641.

0.003221496 *931.4940641 = let's compute 0.003 *931.4940641 =2.7944821923.

0.000221496 *931.4940641 ≈0.20638.

So 9.314940641 +2.7944821923 +0.20638 ≈12.3158.

So E_rest =5588.9643846 +12.3158 ≈5601.28018 MeV =5.60128018 GeV.

So E_rest =5.60128018 GeV.

Then E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.60128018 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60128018.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60128018 = let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00128018 ≈0.004567.

So 2.142857142 +0.004567 ≈2.147424.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.004566 GeV.

So about 20.004566 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 higher. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should compute without approximating gamma as 3.57142857, but use more precise values.

Wait, let me compute gamma =1/(sqrt(1 -0.96^2)) =1/sqrt(0.0784)= exactly 3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest in a more precise way.

Wait, another approach: the exact formula.

The total energy E is gamma * m0 c².

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 * m0 c².

m0 is the rest mass of Li-6. m0 =6.013221496 u.

So m0 c² =6.013221496 u * c².

But I can compute this as 6.013221496 *931.4940641 MeV.

Which is 6.013221496 *931.4940641 = let's compute this.

6 *931.4940641 =5588.9643846 MeV.

0.013221496 *931.4940641 ≈12.3158 MeV.

Total is 5601.2801846 MeV =5.6012801846 GeV.

So E_total =3.57142857 *5.6012801846 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6012801846.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6012801846 = approx.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0012801846 ≈0.004570.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.004570 =2.147427142.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.00456999 GeV.

So approximately 20.00457 GeV, which is about 20.0046 GeV.

But none of the options are exactly 20.0046. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption about the mass is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.013221496 u, but perhaps I should use the exact rest energy calculation in kg and then compute E accurately.

Let me compute E_rest = m c^2 with precise values.

m =6.013221496 u =6.013221496 *1.66053906660e-27 kg =9.985193399e-27 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

E_rest = m c² =9.985193399e-27 kg * (299792458)^2.

Compute (299792458)^2:

299792458 *299792458 = approximately 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So E_rest =9.985193399e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Multiply: 9.985193399e-27 *8.987551787e16.

= (9.985193399 *8.987551787) e (-27 +16) = (9.985193399 *8.987551787 )e-11.

Compute 9.985193399 *8.987551787 ≈ let me compute that.

9 *8.98755 =80.88795.

0.985193 *8.98755 ≈8.8547.

So total ≈80.88795 +8.8547=89.74265.

So E_rest ≈89.74265e-11 J.

Convert to GeV: 1 eV =1.602176634e-19 J.

So E_rest =89.74265e-11 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (89.74265 /1.602176634 ) *1e8 eV.

89.74265 /1.602176634 ≈56.0.

So 56.0 *1e8 eV =56e8 eV =56e8 eV =5.6e9 eV =5.6 GeV.

Wait, that's back to 5.6 GeV. So E_rest is 5.6 GeV.

Then the total energy E =3.57142857 *5.6 =20.0 GeV exactly.

But according to this, the energy should be exactly 20 GeV. But no option is exactly 20 GeV. The options are C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher, and others are further away.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in using the mass of Li-6 as 6.013221496 u. Let me confirm the exact mass.

Wait, according to the periodic table, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.013221496 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is not 3.57142857 but a more precise value.

Wait, 1/sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 3.57142857142857... So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the sum of the masses of the nucleons, but the actual nucleus has a binding energy, which would make the rest mass slightly less. But in this problem, perhaps we're supposed to ignore binding energy and just sum the nucleon masses. Hmm.

Wait, even if I sum the nucleon masses, I get around 5.6 GeV for E_rest, leading to E=20 GeV.

But none of the options is exactly 20 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly higher result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest more accurately.

E_rest =6.013221496 u *931.4940641 MeV/u = let's compute this precisely.

6.013221496 *931.4940641 =?

Let me compute this as 6 *931.4940641 +0.013221496 *931.4940641.

6 *931.4940641=5588.9643846 MeV.

0.013221496 *931.4940641=0.013221496 *931.4940641.

Compute 0.01 *931.4940641=9.314940641.

0.003221496 *931.4940641=0.003 *931.4940641=2.794482192.

0.000221496 *931.4940641=approx 0.20638.

So 9.314940641 +2.794482192 +0.20638=12.3158 (exactly).

So total E_rest=5588.9643846 +12.3158=5601.2801846 MeV=5.6012801846 GeV.

So E_rest=5.6012801846 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * E_rest=3.57142857 *5.6012801846.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6012801846.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6012801846.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0012801846 = let's compute that.

0.001 *3.57142857=0.00357142857.

0.0002801846 *3.57142857= approx 0.001000.

So sum is approximately 0.004571.

So 2.142857142 +0.004571=2.147428.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.00457 GeV.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation where the rest mass is taken as 6 *938 MeV, which is 5628 MeV, 5.628 GeV.

Then, gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628=?

3 *0.628=1.884.

0.57142857 *0.628= let me compute 0.57142857 *0.6=0.342857142; 0.57142857 *0.028=0.01596.

So 0.342857142 +0.01596=0.358817142.

So 1.884 +0.358817142=2.242817142.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.1 GeV.

So about 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close.

Ah, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the rest mass as 6 *938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.1 GeV, hence option C.

So based on that, the correct answer would be option C) 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The nucleus X is Lithium-6 (Li-6), with a rest mass of approximately \( 6.013221496 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.4940641 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 6.013221496 \times 931.4940641 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5601.28 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60128 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857.
\]

The total energy is then:

\[
E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.57142857 \times 5.60128 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285, \quad 3.57142857 \times 0.60128 \approx 2.147613.
\]

Adding these:

\[
E \approx 17.85714285 + 2.147613 = 20.004756 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This result rounds to approximately \( 20.005 \, \text{GeV} \). However, the closest option provided is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), which aligns with a slightly higher approximation of the rest mass energy or rounding differences in intermediate steps.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
