Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, pretty rigid. So, 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, probably leading to an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a base, they typically undergo an E2 elimination to form an alkene. So, the product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond where the bromines were.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Alkenes are often less reactive but maybe it's a diene? Or perhaps the product is a strained alkene. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Oh, that's a carbonyl stretch, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the starting material was a dihalide. Could the product be a diketone?

Wait, no. Wait, KOH is a base, but for vicinal dihalides, elimination would form an alkene, but maybe in this case, especially with such a rigid structure, elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but substitution of two bromines with hydroxide would give a diol. But wait, the IR has 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a double bond, but the initial product is an alkene. Then, upon heating with KOH, perhaps some other reaction occurs. Or maybe the dihalide is treated with a base to form an epoxide, but that's not likely with KOH. Or maybe elimination leads to a conjugated diene? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet? Or a quartet? Wait, the splitting isn't given. The 4.79 is probably the most upfield, but that's not necessarily the most deshielded. Wait, the most deshielded would be downfield. So, looking for the downfield peak.

Wait, 4.79 (2H) is a singlet? Maybe. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the adamantane ring protons. And 1.94 (2H) could be another set, perhaps the ones adjacent to the oxygen or a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How could that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, another thought: maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, perhaps a double dehydrohalogenation occurs, forming a carbonyl group. But wait, how? Oh! Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that elimination would form a ketone. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides are on carbons that, upon elimination, form a bridgehead double bond, but in adamantane, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and when KOH is added, they eliminate to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Wait, maybe it's a case of vicinal dihalide converting to a ketone via a two-step elimination. Let me think: each Br could be replaced by an OH group, but then maybe the two OH groups could undergo some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by O- in the presence of KOH. But KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it deprotonates something. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Let me think: if two vicinal bromides lose two HBr molecules, perhaps forming a double bond. But then why would that give a ketone?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, what if the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, product 1 is an adamantadiene, perhaps. But then the IR would show an alkene peak, around 1600-1680, but the given peak is at 1720, which is more of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, but wait, or maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the 2H at 4.79 are part of an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, the 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 next to a carbonyl, which would make sense if there's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene, but then something else happens. Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But I don't see how that would lead to a carbonyl IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement occurs when a diol (vicinal diol) is treated with acid, leading to a carbonyl. But in our case, the starting material is a dihalide, and the reaction is with KOH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diol. KOH in excess would substitute each Br with an OH group. So 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, when heated with KOH, perhaps some elimination occurs, but how? Wait, when a diol is heated with a base, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. But wait, that's the pinacol rearrangement which needs acid, not base.

Hmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me think again. The IR shows a carbonyl, so product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a carbonyl upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, another approach: perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form a di-ester or something. Alternatively, maybe the two Brs are replaced by hydroxide groups, making a diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl.

Wait, that's the pinacol rearrangement. Wait, but that requires a vicinal diol, and in the presence of acid, not base. So maybe under basic conditions, the diol doesn't undergo that rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is formed, and under heating, it loses two water molecules to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require two eliminations, perhaps forming a ketone. Wait, maybe each -OH group loses a water, but that's not possible because each OH can only lose one H2O. Wait, perhaps two OH groups eliminate to form a carbonyl. Maybe a 1,3-diol would form a diketone via two eliminations, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diketone. Let me think. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to a double elimination to form a ketone. How? Each Br could be replaced by an O- group, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and upon dehydrohalogenation, each elimination forms a double bond. But that would give an alkene, but the IR indicates a carbonyl.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about product 1. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -OCH2O- group or similar. Or maybe an -OCH2- group. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, each Br leaves, and two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But wait, that would give an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl. Wait, but bridgehead carbonyls are possible, I think.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then the two hydroxyls are in a position that allows them to form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps the diol, after elimination, forms a carbonyl. For example, if the diol is 1,3-diol, then perhaps upon heating, it loses two water molecules from adjacent carbons to form a triple bond? No, that would be a different stretch. Wait, but the IR is at 1720, which is more of a ketone. So, perhaps the diol loses two water molecules via elimination to form a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the diol is 1,3-diol, and upon elimination, two water molecules are lost, forming a conjugated carbonyl group. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 has a ketone group, so perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or some kind of acylation product. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, but 1 is a ketone, so when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would require an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, Al(OiPr)3 could act as a catalyst for ring-opening. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester or an acid.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR again. The 1720 cm-1 peak is strong, so it's likely a carbonyl, probably a ketone. So product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → something with a ketone.

So perhaps the dihalide loses two equivalents of HBr, forming a ketone. So, the two adjacent C-Br groups lose HBr each, and the two carbons form a carbonyl group. That would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons, and their elimination would form a double bond between those carbons, but perhaps in a bridged structure, it forms a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when two bromides are on adjacent carbons in a bridged bicyclic system, elimination can lead to a carbonyl. For example, norbornene derivatives sometimes form when vicinal dihalides eliminate. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure.

Okay, assuming product 1 is a ketone, let's move on. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. So, maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but since adamantane isn't aromatic, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of enolization or forms an enolate. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted into an acylium ion, which then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether or ester. Wait, but the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 might be an enol ether or some other structure.

Wait, another angle. Ozone is then bubbled through solution 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis setup. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozone reacts with alkenes to form ozonides, which upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) break into carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Therefore, product 2 must have a double bond. So, going back: product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which has a double bond. So, product 1 must be something that can form a double bond when treated with Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. It can sometimes catalyze the formation of alkenes from alcohols via elimination. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via acid-catalyzed elimination.

Wait, but earlier, product 1's IR has a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something that has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enolate that tautomerizes or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol with a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, a base or acid, it undergoes some elimination to form a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the most deshielded hydrogen. So, perhaps the most deshielded is near a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the H's adjacent to the carbonyl are deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let me try to piece this together again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR: 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl). So product 1 has a ketone.

Step 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene via elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al(OiPr)3 helps in eliminating to form an alkene. So product 2 is an alkene.

But earlier, product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). Diol protons are usually around 1-5 ppm. If product 1 is a diol, the 4.79 could be the -OH groups, but more likely, they would appear as broad peaks unless exchanged. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH:

Vicinal dihalide (adjacent Brs) + strong base → likely elimination to form an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene.

Wait, but then why is the IR showing a carbonyl (1720 cm-1)? Because alkenes have C=C stretches around 1600-1680. So maybe the IR is not the main peak. Wait, but the question says it has a characteristic absorbance, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. So maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone, perhaps via a conjugated diene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. How? If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide loses two Brs and forms a carbonyl group between them. So, the structure would have a ketone where the two Brs were.

So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. So, the product would be a cycloketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. That would fit the IR data (two ketone peaks?), but the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which is possible for a ketone.

So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. Lewis acids can catalyze various reactions, like the formation of enolates or Friedel-Crafts. But since adamantane is a rigid structure without aromatic rings, Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable here. Alternatively, the Lewis acid could catalyze an elimination reaction if product 1 is a diol or something else. But product 1 is a diketone, so perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the diketone undergoes some kind of enolization to form an enol, which could tautomerize. But I'm not sure how Al(OiPr)3 would help in that.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is converted into an enol ether or some kind of enol, which then undergoes further reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps product 1 is an ester. No, because the reaction with KOH would likely form a ketone or an alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cycloketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via a reaction catalyzed by Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let's think about step 3: product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is an alkene.

So, product 1 must have been a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 (a Lewis acid) undergoes elimination to form an alkene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of product 2 forms product 3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis breaks the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Let me adjust my earlier thought. So, step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → diol (product 1). Then, step 2: diol + Al(OiPr)3 → alkene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3, which is a carbonyl-containing compound.

But wait, the NMR of product 1 was given. So, product 1 has a peak at 4.79 (2H). If it's a diol, the protons adjacent to the OH groups would appear around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit upfield for OH protons, unless they're de-shielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diol, the protons on the adjacent carbons would be around 3-4 ppm. So the 4.79 could be something else, like a CH2 next to an oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I don't think KOH would form an epoxide; that usually requires peracids or other conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a geminal diol (two OH groups on the same carbon). But that's less likely because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would require the OHs to be on adjacent carbons.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on step 1. Let me think again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so likely elimination. Vicinal dihalide elimination gives an alkene.

So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane? But then why the IR shows a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, formed via a different mechanism. Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then the diol loses water to form a ketone. Wait, that would require a vicinal diol undergoing dehydration to form a ketone. But how? That's not a typical pinacol rearrangement, which requires a 1,2-diol.

Wait, for a 1,3-diol, would elimination form a carbonyl? I'm not sure. Maybe two eliminations occur, each losing a water from adjacent carbons, forming a carbonyl group. That could result in a ketone in the center.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by treating with Al(OiPr)3. Perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone that, upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, undergoes some kind of rearrangement or elimination to form an alkene. If that's the case, then product 2 would have a double bond.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond into carbonyl groups.

Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near electronegative groups, like oxygen. So, perhaps it's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each fragment gets an O from ozone. So, if product 2 was a symmetric diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the structure of product 2 would determine the structure of product 3. Let's try to imagine the structure.

Assuming product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded.

In the NMR, the most deshielded H would be next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring H's.

For example, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, each H on CH2 would couple with adjacent Hs. If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would have two neighboring Hs (like a triplet), but maybe more.

Wait, let's think of a specific case. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would have neighboring Hs. Each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling with the adjacent CH2's Hs.

In such a case, each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which would be a quartet?), but wait, no, if each H is next to two Hs on the same CH2, that's a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, suppose the Hs are on adjacent carbons, each with two neighboring Hs. For example, if a CH2 is next to a carbonyl and a CH group, maybe each H on CH2 would have two adjacent Hs.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. That would be a triplet of triplets, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls. Each H would have two Hs on the same CH2, and each would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So for each H, it's coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a quintet (n+1 where n=4?), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the CH2 is between two carbonyls. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have four neighboring Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But wait, no, each H on the first CH2 is only coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet. But perhaps because the adjacent CH2 has two Hs, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the two CH2 groups are identical, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl, which would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent CH2. But in reality, the coupling is between Hs on adjacent carbons. So, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would be a triplet (n=2, so 3 peaks).

Wait, that would make sense. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to a carbonyl and another CH2 would be a triplet.

But if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH group, which is adjacent to a CH2. So a CH next to a CH2 would have coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But in the case where the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl and a CH2, each H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH group is between two carbonyls, each H would have only one adjacent H (since it's a CH group, not CH2), so each H would couple with one H, leading to a doublet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure after ozonolysis.

Product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 was a cyclohexene ring, product 3 would be a diketone.

But in the case of adamantane derivatives, the structure is more rigid. So, product 2 could be an alkene within the adamantane framework. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

In such a case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on CH2 groups. Each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be next to the other CH2 group.

So, each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But in reality, each H on the CH2 would only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but each H on a CH2 is split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, for each H, the coupling constant would be with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Each H would see two neighboring Hs, so each would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is coupled with two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. So, the correct coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are in a symmetrical position, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the simplest case, each H on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H (probably on the CH2 next to carbonyl) would show a triplet in the NMR.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, derived from a multi-step reaction sequence. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is a vicinal dihalide. When heated with KOH, a strong base, elimination occurs, likely forming an alkene. However, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not stop at forming an alkene but proceeds further, possibly through a rearrangement or additional elimination, to form a ketone. Thus, product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantanedione, a diketone.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃)**  
   Al(OiPr)₃ is a Lewis acid, often used to catalyze eliminations or rearrangements. Given that product 1 is a diketone, the reaction likely forms an alkene (product 2) through an elimination process. This aligns with the subsequent ozonolysis step, which requires a double bond.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond produces carbonyl groups at the break points. Therefore, product 3 is expected to be a diketone, with carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the structure of product 3, hydrogens on a CH₂ group flanked by two carbonyl groups are the most deshielded. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

5. **Coupling pattern**  
   The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is determined by the number of neighboring hydrogens. In this case, each hydrogen on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl couples with two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- **A) Triplet**: This matches the expected coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with hydrogens from two different sets of neighboring groups, which is not the case here.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would imply coupling with one hydrogen from one group and two hydrogens from another, which is not applicable here.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not observed in this structure.

Thus, the correct coupling pattern is a triplet.

**Answer: A**
