Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through each part.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I need to find out what the concentrations are after dilution. So the initial step is mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. When you mix two solutions, the total volume changes, so the concentration changes.

Wait, right, because the volume increases, the concentration decreases. Since the volumes are the same, it's a 1:1 dilution, so the concentration should be halved. So 0.05 M divided by 2 gives 0.025 M acetic acid. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

But wait, is that right? Let me check. The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (L) multiplied by molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So new concentration is moles/volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me tackle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially is 0.001 mol. The NaOH needed to reach equivalence is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

Wait, but the initial diluted solution is 40 cm³, and we're adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³.

At equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic.

The concentration of sodium acetate at equivalence is moles / total volume. The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 mol (same as acetic acid initially). Total volume is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But wait, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's assume x is the [OH-] produced.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

In the approximation, since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] is about 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.48. pH is 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. The square root of that is approximately 3.288e-6. So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516, so 0.516 + 5 (since 1e-6 is pH 6) → 5.516, so pOH ≈5.516. pH is 14-5.516=8.484. So approximately 8.48. Looking at the options, one of them has 8.52, which is close. So the equivalence pH is around 8.52.

Now, the second part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the way to equivalence. So the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but let me think again. The equivalence point is when 0.001 mol NaOH has been added. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So when 25% of the required NaOH volume is added.

So, the reaction is: 0.00025 mol NaOH reacting with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid. So the mixture after 25% titration will have:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (from NaCH3COO): 0.00025 mol.

And the total volume is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (which is 25% of 10 cm³, because the equivalence is at 10 cm³, right? Wait, no, wait. Because the NaOH needed is 10 cm³ for equivalence, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³, right. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka) → Ka is 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so pKa = 4.733 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 4.733).

Wait, let me compute pKa more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Taking log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is ~0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.4771) ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Alternatively, 4.256 which is about 4.26.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.33333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26.

So pH at 25% is about 4.26, and at equivalence it's around 8.52. Looking at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → this would fit.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about the equivalence point calculation. Did I make a mistake there?

Earlier, I calculated Kb as 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

Let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054 * 1e-9 = 5.4054e-10.

Then, in the acetate solution, concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb = 5.4054e-10. The expression is Kb = (x²) / (0.02) → x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11 → x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6).

Compute log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is approximately 0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832 → pOH =5.4832. pH=14-5.4832=8.5168, which is about 8.52.

So that part checks out.

So the equivalence pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is 4.26. So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → which matches.

Other options: Let me check what option D is. D says pH 4.57 at 25% and 6.92 at equivalence. No, that doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol), and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of sodium acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Sodium acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Using the approximation \(x \ll 0.02\), we solve:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.3333) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
