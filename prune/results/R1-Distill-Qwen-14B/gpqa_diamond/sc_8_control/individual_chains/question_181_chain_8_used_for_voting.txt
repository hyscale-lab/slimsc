Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a big one. The question says that the pp-III branch stopped suddenly about 8.5 minutes ago. I need to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands of neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-III branch... Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of energy, and there's the pp-II and pp-III branches as well. The pp-III involves higher mass states or something, right? But if the pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various reactions. The pp chains, especially the main branch, produce electron neutrinos. Oh, but wait, pp-III might contribute to some of the high-energy neutrinos. Oh, because the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main branch since the reactions involve higher masses or more energetic processes.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would stop. So the flux in higher energy bands would decrease compared to lower ones. But the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower than band 2.

Assuming that the pp-III branch is the main source for the higher energy neutrinos. If it stops, the flux in band 2 would drop. But what about the flux in band 1?

Wait, the pp-I branch produces neutrinos at certain energies, maybe lower than what pp-III does. If the pp-III is stopped, does that affect the overall neutrino production? Or just the high-energy part?

I think the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I branch, producing neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches contribute less but produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would be reduced, but band 1 might not be as affected because it's in a lower energy range. Or wait, maybe band 1 is still in the higher end; 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV. Hmm, but pp-I produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. So perhaps the flux in band 1 is mainly from the pp-I branch, which isn't affected. 

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The pp chain's main branch (pp-I) produces neutrinos at about 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease. But what about the 700-800 keV band? Are those from pp-I or other sources?

Alternatively, maybe the solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 0.5 MeV, with a tail extending to higher energies. So the flux drops off as energy increases. If the pp-III branch contributes to the higher end (like 800 keV and above), stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2, while band 1 (700-800) might still have some flux from other sources or from the main branch.

But if pp-III is responsible for a significant part of the high-energy neutrinos, then when it stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop, whereas band 1 (700-800) might not drop as much, or maybe drop a little if some of that comes from pp-III. Alternatively, perhaps the higher energy bands are mostly from pp-III, so without it, the flux in band 2 would be much lower than band 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2). If pp-III stops, then band2's flux drops. So the ratio would increase. Because if band2 has less flux, the ratio band1/band2 would be larger than before.

But what is the ratio before? In the normal case, the solar neutrino flux peaks around 0.5 MeV. So higher energy bands have lower flux. So normally, the flux in band1 (0.7-0.8) is lower than band0 (0.5-0.6), but higher than band2 (0.8-0.9), right? No, wait, higher energy bands have lower flux. So band1 is higher energy than band0, but lower than band2.

Wait, no. As energy increases, flux decreases. So band1 (0.7-0.8) is higher energy than band0 (0.5-0.6), so flux in band1 is less than band0. But band2 is higher (0.8-0.9), so its flux is even less. So the flux in band1 is higher than band2.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the flux drops as energy increases. So band1 is higher than band0, so band0 has higher flux than band1, which in turn has higher flux than band2.

So if the pp-III branch stops, which produces all the neutrinos in band2, then the flux in band2 would drop to zero (assuming pp-III is the only source for that band). But that's probably not the case, because other reactions might contribute a little. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So all other reactions remain as they were. So in the Sun, the main source of neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos in lower energies. The pp-II and pp-III contribute to higher energies.

So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in the highest bands (like band2) would drop. But band1 might still have some flux from the pp-II branch or perhaps the main pp-I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the main pp chain (pp-I), the neutrinos have an energy around 0.5 MeV. So the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) is higher than the main pp-I. So perhaps the flux in this band comes from the pp-II and pp-III branches. So if pp-III stops, then the higher part (above 0.8 MeV) would be affected more.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me think: The main pp reactions produce neutrinos with energies around 0.5 MeV. The other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. So pp-III might be responsible for the 0.8 MeV and above neutrinos.

So in that case, if pp-III stops, the flux in band2 (800-900 keV, 0.8-0.9 MeV) would be significantly reduced, maybe to zero. But band1 (700-800 keV, 0.7-0.8 MeV) might still have some flux, perhaps from the pp-II branch.

Wait, but I'm not certain if pp-II contributes to band1 or band2. Let me try to remember. The pp-II branch might produce neutrinos around 1.0 MeV, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces higher, and the pp-II a bit lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the range of about 0.8-1.0 MeV, so when it stops, the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) would be much lower than before. The flux in band1 (0.7-0.8) might come mainly from the pp-I branch, which isn't affected. Wait, but the pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos, so perhaps the band1 would have some flux from maybe other processes, like the pep branch or something else. Or perhaps the main pp-I contributes neutrinos in the lower energies, and higher bands have contributions from other processes.

Wait, I think that the main pp-I chain produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, produce higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, then the neutrinos in the higher energy bands (like band1 and band2) would be affected.

But wait, if the pp-III is responsible for the higher part of the neutrino spectrum, then stopping it would eliminate the neutrinos in the highest energy bands. So band2 (0.8-0.9) would have much less flux, perhaps near zero, while band1 (0.7-0.8) might have some flux from other sources.

Wait, but how much would the flux in band1 decrease? If the pp-III is the only source for band2, then the flux in band2 would drop to a much lower level. So the ratio of band1 over band2 would be much higher than before.

But the question is asking for the approximate ratio. If the pp-III is the main source of the higher energy neutrinos, then without it, the flux in band2 would be negligible compared to band1, which is still getting some neutrinos from other branches.

So initially, before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band1 and band2 would be following the general trend of decreasing flux with higher energy. So band1's flux is higher than band2's. But after pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot. So flux(band1)/flux(band2) would increase.

Wait, but before the stoppage, band1 would have, say, F1, and band2 F2, and F1 > F2 as per the energy distribution. After the stoppage, F1 remains roughly the same (if it's from other branches), and F2 drops to zero or near zero. So the ratio F1/F2 becomes very large.

But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So if the ratio is about 10 or higher, the answer would be A) 10. Or maybe it's 1 if the ratio didn't change much, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe the bands have a different spread. Let's think about the actual flux.

In the solar neutrino spectrum, the flux drops with energy, with a peak around 0.5 MeV. So, the flux in band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be lower than the peak but higher than band2 (0.8-0.9). So the flux in band1 is higher than band2. The ratio F1/F2 is about, say, (0.05) / (0.02) = 2.5, but that's just a guess.

But if the pp-III branch is responsible for a significant part of band2, then without it, the F2 would drop to near zero, making the ratio F1/F2 very large. But I'm not sure how much of band2 is due to pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes a small fraction of the total neutrino flux. So stopping it would only slightly reduce the high-energy flux, but not by an order of magnitude.

Wait, but the question states that the pp-III stopped, and all other reactions remained as they were. So any other neutrino sources are still active, like the pp-I and pp-II branches.

If the pp-III is a minor contributor, then the flux in band2 might decrease, but not to zero. However, if the pp-III is a major contributor to the high-energy neutrinos, then band2's flux would be almost gone.

I think that the main source of the higher energy neutrinos (like above 0.5 MeV) is the pp-II and pp-III branches. So if pp-III stops, perhaps the flux in band2 would drop to a small fraction of its previous value.

But without knowing the exact percentages, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the typical flux ratios.

Wait, I remember that the flux of solar neutrinos peaks around 0.5 MeV, and the flux decreases with higher energy. So the flux in 0.7-0.8 MeV (band1) is roughly half of the peak, and band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is a tenth of the peak. So the ratio would be (0.5)/(0.1) = 5. So if the pp-III contributes to the higher part, say, 90% of band2's flux, then stopping it would leave 10% of the original band2 flux.

So, the original F1 was 0.5, F2 was 0.1.

After stopping, F2 drops to 0.01 (assuming 10% remains). Then F1 is still 0.5, so F1/F2 becomes 50, which is way higher than any of the options. But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes to a part of band1 as well. Maybe band1 is partly from the pp-III and pp-II branches. So if pp-III stops, both band1 and band2 would be affected.

But then the question is about the ratio. Let's think differently. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, but perhaps band1 includes some from the pp-III. So stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in both bands, but more so in band2.

Assuming that before the stoppage, the flux in band1 is from both the pp-I and pp-III, and band2 is mainly from pp-III.

So, let's say F1 = F_ppI_1 + F_ppIII_1.

Similarly, F2 = F_ppIII_2.

If the pp-III stops, then F_ppIII_1 and F_ppIII_2 are zero. So F_new1 = F_ppI_1, F_new2 = 0.

But in reality, maybe pp-III contributes to band1 as well, but perhaps a smaller fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp-I doesn't produce neutrinos in band1, but the other branches do. So if pp-III is stopped, then band1 would lose some flux, but band2 would lose almost all.

Wait, that might change the ratio.

Alternatively, think about the energy distribution. The flux decreases with increasing energy. So band1 is higher than the peak, band2 higher still.

If the pp-III is responsible for the high end of the spectrum, then without it, the flux in band2 might drop to almost zero, while band1 might decrease but not as much.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (some fraction) / (nearly zero) which is very large. But the options don't have a very large number except for option A) 10.

But wait, if the pp-III contributes to both bands, maybe band1 gets a small contribution and band2 most of its flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source for the highest energy neutrinos, so the flux in band2 would drop, making the ratio increase.

But without knowing the exact contributions, it's tricky.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the overall neutrino flux. If it's stopped, the overall neutrino flux would drop, but not the main part. So the flux in band1 might decrease a little, and in band2 a lot.

But the ratio would depend on how much each band is affected. If band1's flux was, say, 10 counts and band2 was 1 before the stoppage, after the stoppage, band1 might drop to 5 and band2 to 0.1. Then the ratio would be 5/0.1=50. But the options don't have 50. So perhaps the assumption that the pp-III's contribution is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a small amount, so the flux in band2 only drops by a factor of 10. So if the original ratio was 1 (F1=F2), the new ratio would be 10 (F1 remains same, F2 drops by 10x).

Wait, that's possible. So the ratio would be 10. That would correspond to option A.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: the pp-III produces a certain part of the high-energy neutrinos. If it stops, the neutrinos in those higher bands would be significantly reduced. So the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) would drop to a much lower level than band1 (0.7-0.8), which is lower in energy, so their flux is higher.

So the ratio would be higher than 1. The options are A)10, C)1, etc. So the correct answer would be A)10.

The question involves the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core, which affects the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, particularly in the range of 0.8-1.0 MeV and above. When the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is significantly reduced or eliminated, while band 1 (700-800 keV) retains some flux from other sources, such as the pp-I or pp-II branches.

The solar neutrino flux generally decreases with increasing energy, with a peak around 0.5 MeV. Band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) is higher in energy than the peak but still receives contributions from the pp-I branch, which is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch. Band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), however, is primarily influenced by the pp-III branch. The sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch would drastically reduce or eliminate the flux in band 2, while band 1 would experience a smaller relative decrease in flux.

Before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 was higher than in band 2 due to the general trend of decreasing flux with increasing energy. After the stoppage, the flux in band 1 remains relatively unchanged, while the flux in band 2 drops significantly. This results in a higher ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2. Given the options, the most reasonable approximation for this ratio is **10**, as the flux in band 2 is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to band 1.
