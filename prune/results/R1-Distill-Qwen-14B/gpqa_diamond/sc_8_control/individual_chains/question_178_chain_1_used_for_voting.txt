Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant kappa and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for determining renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions, or something like that. Wait, no, wait—actually, I think it's that each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension equal to 4, because the action is dimensionless in natural units (since the action has units of Planck's constant, which is dimensionless in natural units). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) times the Lagrangian density should give a dimensionless quantity.

So the given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ. 

Wait, let's break down each term. The fields involved are ψ (fermion fields) and F^{μν} (field strength tensor from electromagnetism, I think). Let me recall the mass dimensions of these fields.

Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation has terms like (∂/i) ψ, and since ∂ has mass dimension 1, ψ must be 3/2 to balance the equation. 

The field strength tensor F_{μν} for a gauge field like electromagnetism is a derivative of the gauge field A, so F has dimension 2. Because A has dimension 1, and F is ∂A, so 1+1=2. 

Now, sigma_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So that's a commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so sigma_{mu nu} is also dimensionless. 

So let's look at each term in the interaction Lagrangian. The structure is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. 

Each ψ̄ and ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then we have F^{mu nu}, which is dimension 2. So the product of all this is 3 + 2 = 5. Wait no, wait, the Lagrangian term is κ times this product. So the term L_int has dimension 4, because the action is dimensionless and the integral is d^4x.

So [L_int] = 4. But [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ_{μν}] + [F^{μν}]. 

Wait, let me think again. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the dimensions are:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2. 

Adding those: [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 = 4 because the entire term must have mass dimension 4. So [κ] = 4-5 = -1. Oh, so the mass dimension of κ is -1. 

Wait, no, wait another thing. Because in the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4. So for the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the sum of the dimensions of each component (including κ) must be 4. 

So let's calculate:

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ together give 3. Sigma is dimensionless (0), and F is dimension 2. So 3 + 0 + 2 = 5. So κ must be 4 -5 = -1. So [κ] = -1. That would mean option A or C has the right dimension.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the terms in the Lagrangian are of mass dimension ≤4. Because in the renormalization process, each interaction vertex's dimension should not require higher than a certain degree. Alternatively, the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, I think the rule is that the interaction term's dimension must be ≤4, but more importantly, the coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≥0. Because if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, it's a dimensionful coupling, which usually implies it's non-renormalizable. Because in the Feynman diagrams, higher-order terms would introduce more divergences that can't be absorbed by the same number of counterterms.

So here, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory would be non-renormalizable. Because the coupling has a negative mass dimension, which typically indicates that the term is of higher order (like a higher derivative term) and thus the theory isn't renormalizable in the conventional sense.

So looking at the options:

Option A says [κ]=-1, theory is renormalizable. But that would be wrong because κ is negative, so theory isn't renormalizable.

Option C says [κ]=-1, theory is not renormalizable. That would be correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) for a gauge field has mass dimension \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).
- The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless, so \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The interaction term \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}\) must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units, and the integral over spacetime (\(d^4x\)) has dimension 4. The term \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}\) is proportional to \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\). Breaking this down:
- \([ \bar{\psi} ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\),
- \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).

Adding these dimensions:  
\[
[ \bar{\psi} ]_M + [ \psi ]_M + [ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M + [ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]

Since \([ \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} ]_M = 4\), the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (\( \geq 0 \)). Here, \(\kappa\) has a mass dimension of \(-1\), which is negative. This indicates that the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling constant is dimensionful, leading to higher-order divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
