Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. Let's break it down.

First, I should probably figure out the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps I'm misreading it. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, but that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, the 'd' might be a typo. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethyl or something. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Or wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let me think, because NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, like when deprotonating to form benzynes intermediates.

Wait, another thought: The structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and methyl groups at 2 and 4 positions. So, positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 4 (CH3). That forms a meta arrangement relative to each other, I think.

So when you treat such a compound with a strong base like NaNH2 in NH3 (which is a polar aprotic solvent and also provides the ammonia for deprotonation), the reaction typically leads to elimination, forming a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the benzene ring, which can undergo various additions.

Wait, so in the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, when treated with a strong base, the H adjacent to Br is abstracted, leading to elimination of Br- and the formation of a triple bond between the adjacent carbons. So positions 1 and 2, because Br is at 1, and the H is abstracted from position 2. Wait, but position 2 has a methyl group attached, so perhaps the H is abstracted from position 6? Because if the Br is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. So, in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the adjacent Hs to Br are at position 2 and 6. But if position 2 has a methyl group, then the H at position 6 would be the one abstracted.

Wait, but wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the ring has Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So positions 2 and 4 are each attached to a methyl group. So, if the Br is at 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl, so the H adjacent to Br is perhaps at position 6. Because the base (NH2^-) would abstract a β-hydrogen, which is in the position adjacent to Br, which is position 6 in this case.

So when NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr, forming a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. But wait, wait, the positions might be different. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are numbered in a circle. So, if the Br is at position 1, the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. But if carbon 2 has a methyl group, then the H to be abstracted would be at position 6.

So the elimination would lead to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2 (or C1 and C6?), but wait no. If we eliminate H from C6 and Br from C1, then the triple bond would be between C1 and C6. But wait, that's the same as C1 and C2 because of the ring structure, right? Because in a benzene ring, each position is connected to the next. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond forms between C1 and C2. No, wait, if the Br is at C1, and the H is at C2, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But in our case, C2 has a methyl group. So can that H be abstracted?

Wait, maybe not. Because if the C2 has a methyl group, the hydrogen adjacent to Br at C1 would be at C2 (if possible) but if C2 is occupied by a methyl, perhaps the H is at C6, which is adjacent to C1. So the base abstracts the H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, if that's the case, then the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, which are adjacent.

But wait, when benzene forms a triple bond, it's a six-membered ring with two adjacent carbons connected by a triple bond. So that would form a diradical, which can then undergo various reactions, like ring-opening or trapping.

So in this case, the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, but wait, C1 and C6 are adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it as the triple bond between C1 and C2, but that's when the H is abstracted from C2. But C2 has a methyl group, so maybe that's not possible. So perhaps the abstraction occurs from C6 instead.

Wait, but in the molecule, the Br is at C1, which is connected to C2 (with a methyl) and C6. If the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from either C2 or C6, but C2 has a methyl. So maybe the H is at C6. So elimination occurs between C1 and C6, leading to a triple bond between them.

So the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, but wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to the next in a circle. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So forming a triple bond between C1 and C6 would create a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which is possible but leads to a very strained structure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the H to be abstracted from C2, which has a methyl group. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene but something else. Alternatively, maybe the 'd' in the question refers to a deuterium. Oh wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So the structure is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Wait, but that would mean it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. But that's a very simple structure, just a bromine and a deuterium on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but that's possible. So in that case, when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton. Wait, but the molecule has a D at position 2. So in this scenario, the H is at position 6, adjacent to the Br at position 1. So when the base (NH2^-) abstracts that H, we get elimination of Br^- and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2 (since those are adjacent). So the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, leading to a benzyne intermediate.

But wait, benzynes can undergo various reactions. Once the triple bond is formed, it can either capture a nucleophile or undergo other additions. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, which then can undergo ring-opening reactions.

Wait, but if we have benzyne, which is a highly strained triple bond, it can undergo various reactions. For example, it can react with nucleophiles or undergo cycloaddition reactions. But in ammonia solvent, perhaps the benzyne will undergo ring-opening to form a diaminobenzene or something else.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. After elimination, we get a triple bond between C1 and C2. Then, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, which provides deprotonation capability, perhaps the triple bond can react further.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo addition in different positions. Wait, but in this case, with the substituents, perhaps the ring is symmetric. Let's think about the structure again. So after elimination, we have a triple bond between C1 and C2. But the original structure had a D at C2 and Br at C1. So after elimination, C1 and C2 are triple bonded, and the substituents (Br and D) are lost? Or wait, no, the Br leaves as Br^-.

Wait, when the base abstracts the H from C6, elimination occurs, and the Br is removed, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2 (since C6 is adjacent to C1, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering here). Alternatively, perhaps it's between C1 and C6, which is the same as C1 and C2 in the ring, given the way benzene is numbered.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne is formed in a way that allows it to open into different products based on where the attack occurs.

Wait, but in the case of the triple bond being at positions 1 and 2, because of the D at position 2 and Br at 1, the benzyne is formed, and then what?

In the presence of ammonia as a solvent, perhaps the benzyne can react with ammonia. Or perhaps in the base, the triple bond can undergo further reactions.

Another possibility is that the benzyne can rearrange or undergo some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction stops at the benzyne stage, and that's the only product. But the question is about the number of organic products, so maybe benzyne is the only product. But the options include B)1, which would be that case.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the starting material is more complex. If it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then when treated with NaNH2, it forms a benzyne intermediate. The triple bond would then be between C1 and C2 (since the H is abstracted from C2, but wait, C2 has a methyl group. So maybe the H is abstracted from C6, leading to triple bond between C1 and C6. But with the methyl groups at C2 and C4, perhaps the benzyne can form in more than one way.

Wait, but if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then when the Br is at C1, the adjacent positions are C2 and C6. But C2 has a methyl group, so the H might be at C6, leading to triple bond between C1 and C6. Alternatively, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a H from C4? No, because C4 is two positions away from the Br. Wait, beta to the Br would be adjacent, so only C2 and C6.

So if the H is abstracted from C6, then the triple bond forms between C1 and C6. Now, considering the substituents, perhaps the benzyne can open in different ways.

Wait, but benzynes can have different sites for attack. For example, the triple bond could react with a nucleophile at either end. But in this case, since the solvent is ammonia, perhaps the ammonia acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, but when benzyne is formed, it's highly strained, so it tends to open quickly. In the presence of a nucleophile, it can add across the triple bond. In this case, since it's in ammonia, which is a weak nucleophile, perhaps the triple bond opens with attack by ammonia at the triple bond positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo ring-opening to form a diaminobenzene, but I'm a bit rusty on that.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Upon treatment with NaNH2, elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if H is abstracted from C2) or between C1 and C6 (if H is abstracted from C6). But wait, C2 has a methyl, so perhaps the H is at C6. So the triple bond is between C1 and C6.

But wait, in a benzene ring, if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, that's equivalent to being between C1 and C2, because the numbering is arbitrary. So maybe it's the same as a triple bond between C1 and C2, but with substituents at C2 and C4.

Wait, no. If the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the substituents would be at C2 (methyl) and C4 (methyl), which are on either side of the triple bond. So when the triple bond opens, perhaps the addition can occur at either end, leading to different products.

Wait, but the triple bond in benzynes is symmetric, so perhaps the attack can happen on either side. Let me think: when the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the substituents are at C2 and C4, then when the triple bond opens, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So when the triple bond opens, the addition could be on either end, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has methyl groups at C2 and C4. So in the triple bond, if the ring is considered as C1 connected to C6, which is connected to C5, which is connected to C4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne, once formed, will have two positions where the triple bond is. Wait, no, the triple bond is between two adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne forms, and then it can undergo addition of two equivalents of ammonia, leading to 1,2-diaminobenzene or something similar. But wait, the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps the triple bond reacts with NH3, leading to a diamine.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, when the benzyne forms, the positions available for attack would be the two carbons in the triple bond. So after the triple bond opens, you can have addition on either carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can lead to different products based on where the attack happens. For example, if the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring has methyl groups at C2 and C4, then the attack could happen at C1 or C2, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, C2 has a methyl group, so perhaps the attack can't happen there because that position is already substituted. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne rearranges into a different structure before reacting. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach. When a bromobenzene with substituents is treated with NaNH2, it typically undergoes elimination to form a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products depends on the number of possible positions where the triple bond can form and subsequently open.

In the starting material, if there are multiple possible beta hydrogens available for elimination, then multiple benzyne isomers can form, each leading to different products upon opening.

In the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the possible β hydrogens are at C2 and C6. But wait, C2 has a methyl group, so perhaps the H is present at C6, leading to triple bond only between C1 and C6. So only one benzyne is formed, which can then lead to one product upon reaction.

Wait, but no. Because the triple bond could form in more than one position, but in this case, perhaps only one is possible because the other position (C2) is blocked by a methyl group.

So if only one benzyne is formed, then how many products would come from it? Well, when the benzyne opens, the triple bond can react with ammonia in two different ways, perhaps leading to two different products.

Wait, but in the presence of ammonia, the triple bond could add ammonia on either end, but considering the substituents, perhaps the attack is directed in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne isn't reactive enough, and the only product is the benzyne itself, but that doesn't make much sense because the question is asking about organic products, which implies the reaction goes to completion.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if the reaction forms only one product, then the answer would be B)1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to retrace.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

1. Treatment with NaNH2, a strong base, leads to elimination of HBr.
2. The β-hydrogen is abstracted, forming a triple bond.
3. The possible β-hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to the Br at 1).
4. However, position 2 has a methyl group, which may block the H from being abstracted. So the H must be at position 6, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Now, with the triple bond between C1 and C6, the benzyne is formed. When this reacts in ammonia, perhaps it adds an amine group. Since the solvent is ammonia, the nucleophile is NH3.

But the addition can occur at either end of the triple bond. However, because of the substituents (methyl groups at C2 and C4), perhaps the attack is more favorable at one position than the other.

Wait, but the positions are symmetric. Let me visualize the ring. C1 has a triple bond to C6. C6 is connected to C5, which is connected to C4 (with a methyl) and C2 (with a methyl). So the positions around the triple bond are C1, C6, C5, C4, C3, C2, C1. Hmm, perhaps the symmetry isn't perfect because of the methyl groups.

Wait, if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, then the ring is symmetric across the C1-C4 axis. Because the methyl groups are at C2 and C4, which are on opposite sides. So when the triple bond opens, the addition of ammonia could happen in a way that leads to either para or meta substitution, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of ammonia can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products. Or maybe only one product is formed due to steric or electronic factors.

Wait, but if the triple bond is symmetric, perhaps the attack can happen in such a way that only one product forms, leading to the same structure regardless of where the attack occurs.

Wait, another thought: When the triple bond opens, the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 and C6) can each add an amine group. But wait, ammonia is a weak nucleophile, so perhaps it adds once, leading to a di-substituted product.

Wait, no, the addition of ammonia to benzyne typically leads to the formation of benzene-1,2-diamine. But in this case, with substituents, perhaps the products are different.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond opens with two equivalents of ammonia, leading to 1,2-diaminobenzene with substituents.

But wait, the starting material has methyl groups at C2 and C4. So after elimination, the triple bond is between C1 and C6. When ammonia adds across the triple bond, the resulting product would have amino groups at C1 and C6, but the methyl groups are at C2 and C4.

Wait, but then the product would be 1,6-diamino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But wait, 1 and 6 are adjacent in the benzene ring, so that's actually 1,2-diamino-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, 1 and 6 are adjacent. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed beyond the benzyne, so the only product is the benzyne itself. But I think the reaction would go further because NaNH2 is a strong base and the conditions are for elimination and further reaction.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So perhaps the reaction forms only one product.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: How many possible elimination sites are there? If the starting material can lose H in only one position, then only one benzyne is formed, leading to only one product.

So in this case, only one product is formed, so the answer would be B)1.

But I'm not sure. Another consideration: Maybe the elimination can happen in more than one position, leading to more than one product. But in the structure given, with the substituents, perhaps only one position is possible for H elimination.

So, considering all that, I think the reaction leads to only one organic product. So the correct answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that promotes elimination, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate. In this case, the β-hydrogen adjacent to the bromine at position 1 can be abstracted. However, the methyl group at position 2 blocks the β-hydrogen at that position, leaving only the β-hydrogen at position 6 available for elimination. This results in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, creating the benzyne intermediate.

The benzyne intermediate is highly strained and reactive. In the presence of ammonia, it can undergo further reactions, typically involving the addition of ammonia across the triple bond. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule and the substituents (methyl groups at positions 2 and 4), the reaction proceeds in a manner that leads to a single product. The elimination and subsequent reaction occur in a way that does not produce multiple distinct organic products.

Thus, the reaction results in only one possible organic product.
