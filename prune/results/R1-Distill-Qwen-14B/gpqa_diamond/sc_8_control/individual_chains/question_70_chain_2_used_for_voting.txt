Alright, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me start by understanding the chemical reactions described in the question.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8 in the reaction. I'm thinking about possible reactions where a solid combines with a gas in such a high ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Because sulfur is solid, and O2 is a gas. S + O2 → SO3? Wait, no, sulfur trioxide is a liquid or gas, depending on conditions, but maybe product C is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal reacting with chlorine gas. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 to form AlCl3, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry there.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is H2. But 8 equivalents would mean a lot of hydrogen. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Let me think of the red product. Red products could be things like mercury(I) oxide (which is red), but that's a solid. Or maybe a transition metal compound. Oh wait, maybe product C is a nitride? Or perhaps something else.

Moving on. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. E being dangerous could mean it's something like a nerve agent, but more likely something like a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound, like a peroxide or something. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm. Let's think of common reactions where a compound produces two acids upon hydration. For example, sulfites reacting with water produce sulfurous acid (weak) and maybe something else? Or perhaps nitrides reacting with water produce ammonia (which is a base though) and something else. Wait, maybe C is a sulfide? No, sulfides usually produce H2S and another acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about C being a metal nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacting with water gives NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But in that case, the products are NH3 and a strong base, not acids. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite or sulfate. Wait, when a sulfite like Na2SO3 reacts with water, it's already in a hydrated form. Maybe not. Alternatively, what about a metal carbonate? Hmm, but metal carbonates reacting with water don't produce acids, they just stay as carbonates.

Wait, another angle. C reacts to produce F and G, which are acids. So perhaps C is a salt that, when in contact with water, undergoes hydrolysis to form two acids. For instance, some metal salts can hydrolyze into two different acids. Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Let me think: if C is something like MgNH4PO4, which is magnesium ammonium phosphate. When it reacts with water, it might produce Mg(OH)2, NH4OH (which is weak), and H3PO4 (which is a weak acid). But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids, not bases.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4) is a salt that can hydrolyze into H2SO4 (strong) and H2S (weak), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like ammonium sulfide, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH3 (a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). That doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Wait, maybe the two acids are HNO3 and H2SO4? But I'm not sure how that would come about.

Alternatively, let's think about the earlier part. When C reacts with D (gas) in 1:2 ratio, produces E. What if D is a gas like O2 or Cl2?

Wait, another approach. Let's try to figure out what each compound could be.

Let me list the reactions:

Reaction 1:
A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)

Reaction 2:
C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3:
C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Reaction 4:
D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let's think about reaction 4. D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. If B is O2, then D might be something else. Or maybe B is Cl2, and D is something that reacts 1:1 with Cl2. Wait, but solvents that form from B and D in 1:1?

Wait, another possibility: If B is H2 and D is Cl2, then H could be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So reaction 4 is H2 + O2 → H2O, but in reality, that requires a catalyst. But in the problem, they're saying D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, if H is H2O, then B is H2 and D is O2? But in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C.

Wait, if B is H2, then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2 → C. What solid A reacts with H2 in large amounts to form a red product? Maybe a metal reacting in a hydrogenation reaction. For example, maybe a metal oxide reacting with H2 to form a metal and water. But that would produce a metal and water, not a red product.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2. Then reaction 4 would be Cl2 + B (like H2) → HCl. But HCl is a gas, so that's not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is another gas.

Wait, perhaps B is CO2. Then reaction 4 would be D + CO2 → H, which is a solvent. But what reacts with CO2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Maybe D is something like CaO, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe D is NaOH, but that's a solid. Not sure.

Alternatively, suppose B is NH3. Then D could be something that when combined with NH3 in 1:1 forms a solvent. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is O2, D is C (carbon). Then O2 + C → CO2, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H is H2O, which is a solvent. So reaction 4 is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1 between D and B, so 2 H2 and 1 O2 would give 2 H2O, but the ratio of B (H2) to D (O2) is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is H2 + O2 → H2O, but that's only possible under specific conditions. But the ratio would be 2 H2 : 1 O2. So that doesn't match 1:1.

Another angle: What if B is O2 and D is H2? Then, H would be H2O. But again, the ratio would be 2 H2 : 1 O2, which is not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, D could be H2, and H could be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O? No, because B is a gas. Wait, B is a gas in reaction 1, but in reaction 4, B is a reactant. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about product E. It's extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemical products? Maybe sarin gas, but that's a stretch. More likely, perhaps something like phosgene? Or more commonly, something like chlorine gas, but if E is Cl2, it's not produced from C and D. Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like HCN? Or maybe a nerve agent is too specific.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly explosive compound, like nitro compounds. Or perhaps it's a toxic gas like Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound. Let me think about the reaction C + 2 D → E. If C is a metal chloride, and D is a strong oxidizing agent, like Cl2, then E could be something like a higher chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, and D is an acid. But C reacting with D would produce CO2 and the corresponding acid. But then E would be CO2, which is a gas but not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but high concentrations can be dangerous. Not sure.

Wait, another thought. Since C reacts with water to produce two acids, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHCO3, it would produce H2CO3 (weak) and NaOH (strong), but that's a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. When sulfites react with water, they can decompose into sulfurous acid (H2SO3, weak) and maybe something else. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like AlN, reacting with water gives NH3 (weak base) and Al(OH)3, which isn't an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, let me think about the reaction where C is a nitride. Suppose C is NH4Cl? No, that's a salt. Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. Not acids.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and C is a sulfate. For example, if A is CuO, C could be CuSO4. Then, CuSO4 reacting with water would just form CuSO4·5H2O, which isn't producing two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, but nitrates usually hydrolyze into nitric acid and other acids.

Wait, if C is a nitride, say, Mg3N2, then reaction with water would produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid, so that's not fitting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a dihydrogen monoxide? No, that's H2O. Alternatively, maybe C is something like CaO, which reacts with water to produce Ca(OH)2, but that's a base. Not acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. FeS reacting with water doesn't do much unless there's acid. But in this case, reaction with water directly gives A, F, G. So maybe C is a more complex compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For instance, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it just stays as Na2CO3 and water, but doesn't produce acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a bicarbonate.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that would produce a base, not acids. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can decompose into H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH. But again, that's a base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride that's amphoteric. For example, AlCl3. When AlCl3 reacts with water, it can form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric). But then, would Al(OH)3 be considered an acid or a base? It's a weak base in water, I think. So F would be HCl (strong acid), and G would be Al(OH)3, which isn't an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. For instance, KNO3. When it reacts with water, it just stays dissolved, but doesn't produce acids. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps F and G are not aqueous solutions but the products of the hydrolysis. Let's imagine C is a metal bromide. When it reacts with water, perhaps it can produce HBr (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, no, metal bromides typically hydrolyze into strong acids like HBr and metal hydroxides. For example, BeBr2 reacts with water to form Be(OH)2 and HBr. But Be(OH)2 is amphoteric, not an acid. So maybe that's a possibility.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, which upon hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, how?

Wait, another possibility: C could be a dialkyl ether, but that might not fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonamide? I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.

Let me try to think of all the given reactions and see if I can find a common thread.

Reaction 1: A + 8B → C (bright red)
Reaction 2: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

So from reaction 4, B and D react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Common solvents are H2O, ethanol, acetone, etc.

If H is H2O, then reaction 4 would be B + D → H2O. So, perhaps B and D are O2 and H2. But as I thought earlier, the ratio in reaction 4 would need to be 2 H2 : 1 O2, which is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternative, H could be ethanol. Then, B and D would react to form ethanol. For example, if B is CO2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is a metal, but that would produce a salt, not a solvent.

Alternatively, B is O2 and D is H2, but again, the ratio issue.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then reaction 4 is B + D → NH3. But NH3 is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Then, reaction 4 would be something like CO2 and H2 → CH3CH2OH, but the reaction would require catalysts and isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol). So, reaction 4 would be CO2 and H2 → CH3OH. That's the Fischer-Tropsch process, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Let me think about other common solvents: acetone, but that's (CH3)2CO. How would that form from B and D?

Alternatively, maybe H is DMF (dimethylformamide), but that's more of a polar aprotic solvent and perhaps not likely here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a reaction where B and D are gases that combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a liquid solvent. Another possibility is if B is H2 and D is a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But CO2 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid, but their reaction would require specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe under high pressure, but that's speculative.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should think about what product E could be. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas, maybe it's something like HCN. HCN is a gas, but how would it form from C and D?

Another thought: Maybe C is a chlorinated compound, and D is something that reacts to form a highly toxic gas. For example, if C is CCl4, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is Cl2. Then, reaction 2 could be the formation of a metal chloride and SO2 or something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is SO3, which is a gas, but reacting with D (Cl2) would produce what? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about product E's symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all point groups. D4h and D∞h are higher symmetry, while C2 and C2v are lower.

If E has a certain structure, its point group would depend on its geometry. For example, if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a twofold rotation axis, it might belong to D∞h or D4h. Alternatively, if it's a linear molecule with certain symmetry elements, like a center of inversion, it could be D∞h.

But without knowing what E is, it's hard to tell. Wait, perhaps E is something like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Or maybe it's something like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C. But earlier I thought E might be Cl2, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, let's try to tie all the reactions together. Let me assume that B is H2, D is O2, and H is H2O.

So reaction 4: H2 + O2 → H2O (with a catalyst, but it's a possible reaction). The ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio between B and D. So that's 2:1, not 1:1. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if reaction 4 is 2 B + 2 D → H, but the ratio is 1:1. Maybe B is O2 and D is C, so 2 O2 + 2 C → 2 CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But again, the reaction would need specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is CO2, but the reaction would produce something else.

Wait, another possibility: If B is H2O and D is another gas. But B is a gas in reaction 1, so H2O is a liquid, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is F2. Then, reaction 4 would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. But HF is a liquid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry would likely be D∞h. If it's a linear triatomic molecule (like O3), the symmetry group would be C2v. Alternatively, if it's a bent molecule like H2O, it would have C2v symmetry.

Wait, if E is a highly toxic gas and is a diatomic molecule, then it's likely to have D∞h symmetry. For example, Cl2, O2, N2, etc. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). But how would E be Cl2?

Looking back: Reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. If E is Cl2, then D must be something that when reacting with C would produce Cl2. Hmm, that's not making sense because Cl2 is already a diatomic element.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry. But O3 is a triatomic molecule with bent structure, symmetry group C2v (option D).

Wait, but O3 is produced by the reaction of O2 with something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. The structure of phosgene is O=C(Cl)Cl, which is planar with a center of inversion. Its point group is D∞h.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

But how would E be formed? Let's think. Reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E.

If D is Cl2, then C would have to react with Cl2 to form phosgene. So C would be CO, and D would be Cl2. Then reaction 2 would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe C is CO, and D is Cl2. Then, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, perhaps:

Wait, if C is CO (carbon monoxide), then reaction 2 would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl? No, I think the correct reaction for forming phosgene is CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + 2 Cl. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe C is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is a toxic gas. SO2 has D∞h symmetry. How would it form? If C is S (solid) and D is O2.

But earlier in reaction 1, A + 8 B → C. If C is SO3 (which is a solid?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a sulfite, and upon hydrolysis, it produces H2SO3 (weak acid) and another strong acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate, like Na2SO4. Reacting with water, it would just stay as Na2SO4 and water, not producing acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it produces HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH. But NH4OH is a weak acid? Or is it a weak base?

Wait, NH4OH (which is NH4+ and OH-) would dissociate into NH4+ and OH-. NH4+ is a weak acid, and OH- is a weak base. So F could be HNO3 (strong), and G could be NH4OH (which is a weak acid in a way). But I'm not sure if that's the intended reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is MgNH4PO4, which is magnesium ammonium phosphate. When it reacts with water, it would produce Mg(OH)2, NH4OH, and H3PO4. Hmm, but again, not exactly two acids.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids. Unless it's in a strong acid solution, which isn't the case here.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think of a different approach.

Let me think about the possible structures of E and their symmetry groups.

Option C is D∞h. This is the symmetry group for diatomic molecules like O2, N2, Cl2, etc. These are linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple symmetry planes.

Option B is D4h, which is also a high symmetry group, often found in molecules like methane (but methane is tetrahedral, which is Td symmetry). Wait, no, D4h is a point group that includes a four-fold principal axis and a horizontal mirror plane. It's typically found in molecules like square planar structures with certain features.

Option A is C2, which is a two-fold rotation axis. It's a lower symmetry group.

Option D is C2v, which includes a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

So, if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is a triatomic molecule like O3, it would be C2v. If E is a square planar molecule, D4h. But O3 is a good candidate for a highly hazardous gas.

Wait, O3 is a toxic gas, and it's a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. The point group for O3 is C2v. So if E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v, option D.

But how would E be O3?

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → O3.

Hmm, O3 is formed when O2 reacts with something. For example, O2 can be converted to O3 by electrical discharge or UV light. But in reaction 2, C and D are reacting to form O3. So, C would have to be O2, and D would be something else. Wait, but O2 plus something else to make O3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is O2 and D is another oxygen source. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let me think about all the reactions again.

Assuming that H is H2O. Then, reaction 4 is B + D → H2O. The ratio is 1:1, so perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then, reaction 4 is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if reaction 4 is H2 + O2 → H2O, but that's not balanced. 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So B is H2, D is O2. The ratio is 2:1, which doesn't match the 1:1 in the problem. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps reaction 4 is O2 + H2 → H2O, but the ratio is 1:2, which again doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe reaction 4 is a different reaction. Let's say B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that would require specific conditions to form a solvent. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. They could react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is B and D reacting to form ethanol. For example, if B is CO2 and D is H2, then under certain conditions, they might form ethanol via the Fischer-Tropsch process. But ethanol is a solvent. So, H is ethanol.

In that case, reaction 4 would be CO2 + 2 H2 → CH3CH2OH (ethanol) + H2O. But the ratio here is 1 CO2 : 2 H2 → 1 ethanol. So the ratio of B (CO2) to D (H2) is 1:2, but the problem states 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of a scenario where all the reactions fit together.

Suppose A is copper(II) oxide (CuO), B is hydrogen gas (H2).

Reaction 1: CuO + 8 H2 → Cu + 8 H2O? No, that would produce Cu and water, but the product C is bright red. Wait, copper is reddish, but I'm not sure if that's what C is.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S8), which is a solid. Reaction with O2 (B) would form SO3 (C), which is a colorless gas, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe solid A is iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is reddish. Reaction with B (H2) would produce Fe metal and water. But Fe metal is silvery, not bright red. So C wouldn't be bright red.

Alternatively, A could be lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown. Not bright red.

Wait, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, A is iron (Fe), B is Cl2. Reaction 1: Fe + 3 Cl2 → FeCl3 (which is yellowish, not bright red). Hmm.

Alternatively, A is Ag, B is Cl2. 2 Ag + Cl2 → 2 AgCl, which is white. Not bright red.

Wait, perhaps C is a red compound. For example, Fe(OH)3 is reddish. But how would that form from A and B?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but those are usually not red.

Wait, maybe C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, not red.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Let me think about the products in reaction 3: two acids, one strong and one weak. So, F is strong, G is weak.

If C is a carbonate, but hydrolysis doesn't produce acids. If C is a sulfite, perhaps it decomposes into H2SO3 (weak) and another acid. Wait, but what's the other acid?

Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate. For example, Ca3(PO4)2. Reacting with water might produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is NH4Cl. When it reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is a weak acid/base). But NH4OH is a weak acid, so that would fit F and G. But then, reaction 3 would be NH4Cl + H2O → NH4OH + HCl. But that's not a typical hydrolysis reaction. NH4Cl is a salt that's soluble in water and produces NH4+ and Cl- ions. Not sure if that produces separate acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, FeS. Reacting with water, especially in presence of acid, produces H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (weak base). But if the water is neutral, maybe not. Alternatively, FeS is a solid that doesn't react with water on its own.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfide, like H2S2O3. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: Maybe C is a superoxide, like KO2. Reacting with water produces O2 and KOH. O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then, reaction with water would just dilute it. Not producing acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids.

Wait, maybe C is a borohydride, but I don't see how that would fit.

I think I'm stuck on reaction 3. Let me try a different approach.

Assume that C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. So, perhaps it's a mixed salt. For example, if C is sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), which in solution can produce H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2- (from Na+). But that's in solution; it's not clear if it would form two separate acids upon reaction with water. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that's a base, not an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is an amide. For example, NH4Cl. No, that's a salt. Wait, if C is NH4NO3, it's a nitrate. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

I'm really not making progress here. Let me try to think of the possible products step by step.

From reaction 4: B and D react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's imagine H is ethanol. So, B and D must be reactants that form ethanol. For example, B is CO2 and D is H2. Then, reaction 4 would be CO2 + 2 H2 → CH3CH2OH + H2O. But that's a Fischer-Tropsch reaction, which is done under high pressure with catalysts. The ratio of B to D is 1:2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is methanol (CH3OH), then reaction 4 would be CO2 + 2 H2 → CH3OH + H2O. Again, ratio is 1:2, not 1:1.

Hmm. Another possibility: H is acetic acid (CH3COOH). Then, reaction 4 would be something like CO2 + CH4 → CH3COOH. But again, not sure about the ratio.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent. Let me think about if B and D could be O2 and CO. Then, reaction 4 would be O2 + CO → CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is a gas and D is a gas that react to form a liquid solvent. Another example is SO3 and H2O forming H2SO4, but that's a reaction between a gas and a liquid.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is B (CO2) and D (H2O) → H (H2CO3, which is not a stable solvent). Hmm, not helpful.

Another approach: Think about reaction 3, where C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. For example, if C is a salt of a diprotic acid. Let's say C is NaHPO4. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but that's a base, not an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a triprotic acid. For example, Na2HPO4. When it reacts with water, it can produce H2PO4^- and OH^- (forming NaOH). So again, not two acids.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think of a different approach.

Let me consider that reaction 1 produces a bright red product. What compounds are bright red? Mercury(I) oxide is red, but it's a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal complex, like CoCl2, which is blue. Or maybe a chromium compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. So if C is K2Cr2O7, then reaction 3 would be K2Cr2O7 + H2O → K2CrO4 + H2SO4? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a permanganate, like KMnO4, which is purple. Not bright red.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, nitrobenzene is a red-brown liquid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a cobalt compound. CoCl2 is blue, but maybe a different oxidation state could give red color.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps C is a sulfide, but I can't think of a sulfide that's bright red.

Another thought: Maybe C is a colloidal solution, like colloidal sulfur, which is red. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a red phosphorus compound. Red phosphorus is a solid, but I'm not sure how it would react.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, V2O5 is orange. Not bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound. MnO is black, MnO2 is black, MnO3 is pink. Not bright red.

Wait, perhaps C is a polycyclic compound, like anthracene, but that's solid and not a gas.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible answer based on the symmetry groups.

If I assume that E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If E is O3, the symmetry group is C2v (option D). If E is a square planar molecule, D4h (option B). If E is a simple two-fold axis, C2 (option A).

Given the options, and that E is a highly toxic gas, which is likely a diatomic molecule, I'll go with D∞h symmetry, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of chemical reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high stoichiometric ratio suggests a possible reaction involving a solid and a gas, potentially forming a compound with specific properties.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This indicates E is likely a highly toxic or reactive compound.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C is a compound that hydrolyzes into two acids, likely a salt or a compound with acidic groups.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies a reaction between two gases forming a liquid solvent, possibly water or another common solvent.

### Key Observations:
- **Symmetry Groups**: The options provided are:
  - **A) C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
  - **B) D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes.
  - **C) D∞h**: The symmetry group for linear molecules like diatomic gases (e.g., Cl₂, O₂).
  - **D) C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, common in bent triatomic molecules like O₃.

- **E as a Highly Hazardous Gas**: E is described as extremely hazardous, suggesting it is a toxic gas. Diatomic molecules like Cl₂ or O₂ are strong candidates for E, as they are toxic and have well-known symmetry groups.

- **Symmetry Analysis**:
  - If E is a diatomic molecule like Cl₂ or O₂, it would belong to the **D∞h** symmetry group, which is characteristic of linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple symmetry planes.
  - If E were a triatomic molecule like O₃, it would have **C2v** symmetry. However, O₃ is less likely due to the lack of evidence in the reactions provided.

- **Reaction Consistency**: The reactions suggest E is a simple, highly reactive gas. Diatomic molecules like Cl₂ align well with this description and have **D∞h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a diatomic molecule like Cl₂ or O₂.
