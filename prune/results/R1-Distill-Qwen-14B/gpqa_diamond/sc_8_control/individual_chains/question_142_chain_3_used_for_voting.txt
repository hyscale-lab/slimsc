Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me think. The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D with different r vectors.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this ρ looks different.

Looking at ρ: it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh, right, that's a mixed state. Each term is a projector, and they're being averaged. So it's an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, what's the geometrical position in the qubit space? I think qubit space is represented as the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how?

Wait, the Bloch vector represents the state. For a pure state |θ, φ⟩, the Bloch vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But for mixed states, it's a bit different. Oh wait, no, for a density matrix in the qubit case, it can be written as a vector in the Bloch sphere, but scaled. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. 

|0⟩ is [1, 0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ becomes (1/2)(I) because I + I is 2I, but wait, no. Wait the given ρ is (1/2)(I), because each projector is I/2 when summed and multiplied by 1/2. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the sum of |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So (1/2)(I) is the density matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, using the general form: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set this equal to (I)/2.

So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I.

Subtract I: r·σ = 0.

Hmm, so the Bloch vector r must satisfy r·σ = 0. Because σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, which for a 3D vector r=(x,y,z), we have x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z = 0.

Wait, but σ matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So if r·σ = 0, that would mean x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z = 0 matrix.

But wait, the sum of those matrices multiplied by r components. Let's write that out.

x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + y * [[0,-i],[i,0]] + z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]

Which gives the equations:

Top-left element: x*0 + y*0 + z*1 = 0 → z = 0.

Top-right element: x*1 + y*(-i) + z*0 = 0 → x - iy = 0.

Bottom-left element: x*1 + y*(i) + z*0 = 0 → x + iy = 0.

Bottom-right element: x*0 + y*0 + z*(-1) = 0 → -z = 0 → z=0.

So from top-left and bottom-right, z must be 0.

From top-right and bottom-left equations: x - iy = 0 and x + iy =0. Adding these two equations: 2x=0 → x=0. Substituting x=0 into the first equation: -iy =0 → y=0.

So x=0, y=0, z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, but what's the significance of r being zero? That would imply that ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ. So yes, the density matrix is I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. Its Bloch vector is at the origin.

So the geometrical position is the origin. Looking at the options: option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the North pole, corresponding to |0⟩ state. Option A is (1,1,0), which isn't a standard point. Option D is (1,1,1), which is outside the Bloch sphere since |r|=sqrt(3), but the Bloch sphere has |r| <=1.

So the correct answer must be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general single-qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space is the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This is not a valid point on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This correctly represents the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** This is outside the Bloch sphere and not valid.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.
