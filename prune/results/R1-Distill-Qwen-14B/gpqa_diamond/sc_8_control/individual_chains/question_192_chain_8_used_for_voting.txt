Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electromagnetism concepts. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller cavity somewhere inside it, not exactly at the center but shifted by s.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. They want to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when you have charges inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute in a certain way. But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged here. Oh, right, because the problem says it's uncharged. So how does that affect things?

I think about Gauss's Law here. For a spherical conductor, the charges would reside on the outer surface, but wait, in this case, the conductor is neutral. But wait, when you have a cavity inside a conductor, any charges placed inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Oh right, that's the method for induced charges.

Wait, the conductor is neutral, but a charge +q is placed in the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material will have charges induced to cancel the field inside the conductor. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, sum to zero.

But the point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field at P, we can use the concept that all the charges outside the Gaussian surface (in this case, the point P is outside the conductor) contribute to the field. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so when we apply Gauss's Law, the field at P would be as if all the charge +q is at the center, right?

Wait, no. The conductor is uncharged but has charges induced. Let me think again. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

So when I consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (like point P), the total enclosed charge is +q (from the outer surface). So by Gauss's Law, the electric field at P should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but what about the position of point P relative to the cavity's center? Because the cavity is not at the center of the conductor, and point P is at some angle theta with distance l from the cavity's center. But since the conductor is a sphere, the charge distribution on its outer surface is uniform, right? So from the outside, any point would see the field due to the net charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, so the field at any external point P would be as if it's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. But the position of the cavity's center is s away from the conductor's center. Does that affect the external field?

Wait, no, because the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces ensure that the field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. The outer surface's charge is +q, so the external field is as if all the charge is at the center.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), since L is the distance from the center of the conductor (which is where the effective charge is considered to be). Because from P's perspective, the conductor's outer charge is +q at the center.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which matches this reasoning.

But wait, I'm confused because the cavity is shifted by s. Does that affect the field outside? Hmm. Let me think again.

In a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly regardless of where the internal charge is placed. So the field outside depends only on the net charge outside, which is +q. The position of the cavity (not at the center) doesn't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed.

So regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, when you're outside, the field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So in this case, the field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). Which is option B.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That might come into play if the field were being calculated as a point charge shifted. But no, because from outside the conductor, the effective charge is at the center.

Option C has l + s cosθ squared. Hmm, maybe if the charge was inside the cavity but not at the center, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²). That would be the case if the charge was at the center of the cavity, but point P is at distance l from the cavity's center, but since the conductor's center is offset, it's not just l². Wait, no, because from the Gaussian perspective, the effective position is the conductor's center.

Wait, but L is the distance from the conductor's center, so that's the relevant distance. So L is bigger than R, so yes, the field is due to the +q at the conductor's center, leading to option B.

So I think the correct answer is B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the induced charge on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a net charge of $+q$, which is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at any external point (including point $P$) is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of the Cavity's Position**: The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. However, the offset of the cavity and the position of the charge inside it do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the conductor's outer surface charge distribution ensures that the field outside depends only on the net charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor.

4. **Distance and Electric Field**: The point $P$ is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}$ does not apply here because the field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge $+q$ at the center, not on the offset of the cavity.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$ matches the field produced by a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, which is the relevant calculation for the electric field at $P$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}$ is not applicable because the field outside the conductor is determined by the net charge at the center, not by the cavity's offset.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$ would apply if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but the field outside the conductor depends on the net charge at the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
