Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they modify the interactions beyond the SM.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the deal with these symmetries? Let's think. I remember that the Standard Model respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT should also respect those unless the operators explicitly break them.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations. Since the SM has Lorentz symmetry, any effective theory based on it should also respect this. So operators in SMEFT must obey Lorentz symmetry. That means option 1 is definitely in.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations, translations, and their combinations. Since the SM has Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT is just an effective theory built from SM fields, the operators should also respect Poincare. So I think option 2 is also required. So far, 1 and 2 are in.

CP symmetry—this is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry completely. For example, CP violation is observed in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT could potentially violate CP, right? But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any operator violates CP, that's allowed. But the question is about what must be respected. Wait, no, wait. No, because the SM already has CP violation, the effective theory can include operators that preserve or violate CP. But I'm getting confused here. Wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's built respecting the symmetries of the SM, but since the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry, SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. So are all operators required to respect CP? No, because some could break it. So 3 is probably not a must.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry—charge, parity, and time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry. So any operator that is part of SMEFT must respect CPT, because otherwise the theory would violate a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory. So 4 is a must.

Wait, so putting it together: which symmetries must be respected. So Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) are musts. But wait, is Poincare separate from Lorentz? Because Poincare includes translations as well. Since SMEFT is built from local operators, I think they must respect both. But I'm not entirely sure if Poincare is automatically satisfied if Lorentz is, because you have to make sure the theory is invariant under translations as well. But since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and uses fields that are in representations of the Poincare group, I think Poincare symmetry is also a must.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Let's think about each symmetry:

- Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they transform in a way that leaves the theory invariant. So yes.
- Poincare symmetry: This combines Lorentz and translations. So for the theory to be consistent, it must respect both. But wait, the operators themselves are local and their terms are part of a theory that's translationally invariant. So maybe Poincare is automatically respected if Lorentz is, but I'm a bit shaky on this. But since the options include both 1 and 2, and the choices are in the options, I'll proceed.

So, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2 → Lorentz and Poincare

B) 3,4 → CP and CPT

C) 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT

D) 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT

Wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So which of these are symmetries that the operators (as part of SMEFT) must preserve.

Lorentz must be respected. CPT must be respected. Because if an operator violates CPT, that would lead to a violation of unitarity or other fundamental principles. So CPT is a must.

Poincare: I think SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. Because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and the operators are local, so they are part of a Poincare-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Poincare.

Wait, but wait, can an operator be a scalar (Lorentz invariant) but not Poincare invariant? Well, I think operators are local, so they are built from fields and their derivatives, which are part of a Poincare-invariant setup. Therefore, Poincare symmetry is automatically respected. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

So options with 1 and 2. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option A is 1,2. So which is correct.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, not the whole theory. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and also under Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically satisfied because the theory is built that way.

Alternatively, maybe all operators are required to form a Poincare-invariant theory. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each symmetry entails. Poincare symmetry includes translations, meaning the theory is invariant under shifting space and time. Since the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which should respect translation invariance, I think that the operators must be such that the theory remains translation invariant. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So the musts are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So that's option C (1,2,4).

Wait, but the options are:

Option C) 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT

Option D) 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT

But earlier I thought that SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry because the SM includes CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can have operators that violate CP, meaning that not all operators must respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option D is not correct.

So the correct musts are 1,2,4.

Looking again, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be symmetric under 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but wait. Some operators could violate CPT? No, because CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Wait, no, in the SM, CPT is a symmetry, and SMEFT is built from SM fields. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT. Because if any operator violates CPT, that would break unitarity or other fundamental principles, which is not allowed in a valid QFT. So all operators must respect CPT.

So, putting it together, the answer should include 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory based on the Standard Model (SM) that incorporates higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries to maintain the consistency of the theory. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is constructed using SM fields. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry to ensure the theory remains consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory and its operators are local, the theory must respect Poincaré symmetry. This symmetry is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is preserved, as the operators are consistent with the framework of quantum field theory.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not strictly respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP symmetry. Since CP symmetry is not a fundamental requirement for all operators in SMEFT, it does not need to be universally respected.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory built from SM fields, must also respect CPT symmetry to avoid violating unitarity or other foundational principles.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a universal requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4
