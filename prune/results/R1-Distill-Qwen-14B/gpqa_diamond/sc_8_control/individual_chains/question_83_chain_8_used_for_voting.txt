Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I guess I need to find the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute, you can use M1V1 = M2V2. The volume doubles, so the concentration halves. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part of the question is about the pH at 25% titration. Oh wait, 25% of what? Oh, the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point first, then take 25% of that for the first part.

Wait, how do I find the equivalence point? At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution. The volume is 40 cm³ (since 20 +20) and concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V in liters. So 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So NaOH needed is also 0.001 moles. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / M = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

So 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Now, I need to find the pH at this point.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So for every mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is neutralized, producing CH3COO^-.

So let's calculate the moles after adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So moles of CH3COOH neutralized are 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- produced are also 0.00025.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001. So remaining moles of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5). Wait no, pKa is -log(Ka), so it's -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is 0.005882, [HA] is 0.017647. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882, and 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647. So ratio is 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. That's the first part. Now, the second part is the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ion will be calculated based on the moles. At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH (since 10 cm³ is 0.01 L, 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles NaOH, which neutralizes all 0.001 moles of acetic acid).

The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M, and we can set up the equilibrium.

Let me write the expression. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02.

x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approx 3.29e-6 M. pH is 14 - pOH. pOH is -log(3.29e-6).

Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so pOH is 5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that would make the first part 4.26, second 8.52. But wait, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated Kb. Let me double-check.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct. So the Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that x is small isn't valid? Let's see. The Kb is 5.4e-10, which is quite small, so x should be much smaller than 0.02. So the approximation holds. So the OH^- is 3.29e-6, pOH about 5.48, pH 8.52.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the 25% correctly? Because the initial volume was 40 cm³, and adding 2.5 cm³.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 25% is based on the volume of NaOH added, but sometimes it's based on the percentage of the reaction. Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which I think means 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³, which is correct.

So the first pH is about 4.26, second is 8.52. So the option A seems correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, you have to recalculate the concentration correctly. Let me check that again.

Original volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume 40 cm³. Molarity is (0.05 M *20 cm³) /40 cm³ = (1 mmol) /40 cm³ => 0.025 M. Correct.

Moles after dilution: 0.025 M *0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Equivalence point: 0.001 mol NaOH needed. 0.1 M NaOH, so 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct.

At 25%: 2.5 cm³ added. Moles NaOH: 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid =0.001-0.00025=0.00075. Moles acetate: 0.00025. Correct.

Volume is 42.5 cm³. So concentrations are 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M, and 0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647) = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.733 -0.477≈4.256.

So 4.26. That's correct. So the first pH is 4.26.

At equivalence, all acid is neutralized. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.4e-10.

Using Kb, [OH] = sqrt(5.4e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.08e-11)≈ 3.29e-6.

pOH=5.48, pH=8.52.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Option A: 4.26;8.52. So that's possible.

But wait, another thought: Maybe the question is considering 25% of the NaOH added to reach the equivalence point, but I think that's the same as what I did. So I think I'm correct.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. When diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M \times V = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required to reach equivalence is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH,25%}} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \times V_{\text{NaOH,25%}} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are equal to the moles of NaOH added:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a) \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ion in water produces a basic solution. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) ions produced. The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([\text{OH}^-]) = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**
