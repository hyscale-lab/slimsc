Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries that SMEFT operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, what's SMEFT again? Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's used when you're considering beyond the Standard Model physics but at low energies, so you can write down higher-dimensional operators that parameterize the possible new physics effects.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

So, let me recall what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Then there's CP, which is charge conjugation combined with parity, and CPT, which combines charge, parity, and time reversal.

In the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory based on the Standard Model, so I think the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so when you write down the operators, you usually include all possible Lorentz-invariant terms, but do they automatically respect Poincare? Hmm. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation, right? But in an effective theory, especially when considering higher-dimension operators, I'm not sure if they must respect Poincare. Or maybe they don't have to because you're considering all possible interactions, including those that break Poincare? Or wait, no, because the operators are written in a way that's Lorentz-invariant, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in the effective theory, the operators are written in a way that's local and Lorentz-invariant, but whether they must respect Poincare... I think that SMEFT respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So if the SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, then perhaps all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 would also be a must.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Because sometimes in effective theories, higher dimension operators can have certain properties. Let me think: the operators in SMEFT are local and constructed to be renormalizable-like, with higher dimensions. But they must still respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz and Poincare. So I guess Poincare symmetry is a given.

But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If an effective theory can have operators that violate certain symmetries, but SMEFT is supposed to be a valid extension, perhaps it only includes operators that respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So Poincare is included.

Wait, but I thought Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if operators must respect Poincare, they must respect Lorentz as well. So if option 2 is correct, then option 1 is automatically correct. But the question gives options that include both 1 and 2 as a possibility. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2 only.

Wait, but then what about CPT symmetry? The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, but I'm not sure if SMEFT must. Wait, no, I think SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. Or wait, is that the case?

Wait, CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry: charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz symmetry enforces CPT invariance under certain conditions (like if the theory is Lorentz invariant and unitary). So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4, CPT, must be respected as well.

But what about CP symmetry? The Standard Model is not CP symmetric. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators would include terms that can violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

So putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Do operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because, Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetry. In the SMEFT framework, when you write down the Lagrangian, it's a local theory, so it should respect Poincare, including translations. So yes, 2 must be correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry pertains to invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is an effective theory derived from the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, option 1 is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations in spacetime. Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry as well. Therefore, option 2 is also correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves the combined transformations of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, does not necessarily respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in phenomena like the CKM matrix. Hence, operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry, making option 3 incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, option 4 is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.
