Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity radius is r, with r less than R. The cavity isn't at the center; its center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity is like a bubble off-center inside the conductor.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, meaning P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. So, let me think about what I know.

First, when a conductor is neutral and a charge is placed inside a cavity, something happens. Oh right, the conductor being neutral but with a charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, isn't the inner surface induced with a charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity? So if +q is placed inside, the inner surface of the conductor (which is the cavity's wall) must have -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q, right? Because the total conductor is neutral, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q to balance.

But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must get +q. Yeah, that makes sense. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, summing to zero.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? I think the electric field outside a charged conductor (spherical symmetry, I think) depends only on the total charge enclosed. So for a point outside, it should be as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. So for this case, the outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The point P is outside the conductor, so it's beyond radius R. So according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge inside the Gaussian surface. The Gaussian surface here would enclose the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor's total charge is zero, but the outer surface has +q. Wait no, the conductor started uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the conductor's inner wall has -q, and the outer wall must have +q so that the total conductor is still neutral. So the charge on the outer surface is +q.

So, when you're outside the conductor (radius R), the field should be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, what if the conductor isn't a perfect sphere and the charge isn't at the center? Oh wait, but in the problem, the conductor is a sphere. So even if the cavity is off-center, the conductor's induced charges rearrange themselves to maintain the field inside the conductor zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface acts as if it has a charge +q at the center.

Wait, but in reality, the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the position of the charge inside. Oh no, wait. For a spherical conductor, any charge inside the cavity will cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface will arrange itself to be a uniform sphere because the conductor is spherical. So the presence of the inner charge affects the inner surface, but the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed regardless of the position of the +q inside the cavity. Therefore, from the outside, the field would be the same as if all the charge +q were at the center.

So in that case, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. The other options involve things like l, s, cos(theta), which don't apply because the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is q. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another thought. Does the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the external field? Because imagine if the charge was very close to the inner surface, would that affect the outer surface's field? For a spherical conductor, no. Because the outer surface's charges are induced in such a way that the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the external field is the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

So that aligns with option B. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small off-center spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The center of the cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, which is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at any point outside the conductor (including point $P$) is as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Since point $P$ is outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor), the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This result is independent of the position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity or the geometry of the cavity itself, as the outer surface of the conductor ensures that the field outside depends only on the total charge $+q$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the external field since the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ at the center.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it correctly represents the electric field outside the conductor due to the charge $+q$.
