Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5*i. And when they measured the positions, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. Our job is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square gives the probability density of finding the particle in a region. So the probability of finding the particle in a certain interval is the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that interval.

Oh right, and for a normalized wave function, the integral of the probability density over all space should be 1. Since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given wave function is only defined where it exists. Wait, no, actually the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but maybe that's a typo? Because usually wave functions are real or complex, but their square modulus should be integrated to 1.

Wait, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. To get the probability density, I need to compute the modulus squared, which is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So the modulus squared would be (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), so squared is a²/(1+x), and the imaginary part is 0.5, so squared is 0.25.

But then, the wave function must be normalized. Because when you integrate the probability density from x=1 to x=3, it should equal 1. So the integral of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 should be 1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the wave function. Because the way it's written, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1. But wait, does that make sense? Because if the wave function is given as that expression, perhaps the imaginary part is a constant, which would lead to an additive term in the modulus squared.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because usually, wave functions are either real or have a certain form. But in this case, it's a complex function with a real part dependent on x and an imaginary part that's a constant.

But let's proceed. So we have:

Integral_{1 to 3} [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Breaking that into two integrals:

a² * Integral_{1 to3} 1/(1+x) dx + Integral_{1 to3} 0.25 dx = 1.

Calculating each part.

First integral: integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3.

So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding these together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What is ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I did everything correctly. Because sometimes, the wave function might have an overall normalization factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex factor, but in this case, it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25, yes.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the wave function must be normalized over the interval where it's non-zero. So setting the integral of the modulus squared to 1 is correct.

So the calculations seem right. Let me redo the math:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is correct.

To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function is normalized over this interval. This means the integral of the probability density over \(x=1\) to \(x=3\) must equal 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
