Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and if there are 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6. So X is Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy, so I remember the formula for relativistic energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is 0.96c, I need to calculate gamma for that speed.

First, let me recall the formula for gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So plugging v = 0.96c into that. Let me compute 1 - v²/c². That's 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

Then, the square root of that. Sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do it more accurately. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, which is less than 1. 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, which is still less than 1. 0.28 * 3.5714 is 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Let me think: 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, because 28^2 is 784, so yeah. So the square root is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857 approximately, which is 25/7, because 25 divided by 7 is about 3.5714.

So gamma is 25/7, exactly.

Now, the energy of the particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c². So I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c². But I think for precise calculations, I should use the exact atomic mass.

Alternative approach: The mass of Li-6 can be found using the periodic table. The atomic weight is 6.015 g/mol approximately. Wait, I think the exact value is about 6.015 u (atomic mass units). But I need to convert that into GeV/c².

Wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 u is 6.015 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, and 0.015 *931.5 is about 13.9725 MeV. So total is approximately 5602.9725 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

So the rest mass energy E_rest is 5.603 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by this. Gamma is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714. So 5.603 * 3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 5.603 * 3 = 16.809. 5.603 * 0.5714 ≈ 5.603 * 0.5 is 2.8015, plus 5.603 * 0.0714 ≈ 0.4006. So total about 3.2021. So 16.809 + 3.2021 = 20.0111 GeV.

But wait, the options are more precise. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, the exact gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571.

So E = gamma * m c². The mass m is 6.015 u.

Wait, let's compute the exact mass in GeV/c².

1 u = 931.49406 MeV/c². So 6.015 u = 6.015 * 931.49406 MeV.

Let me compute that:

6 * 931.49406 = 5588.96436 MeV.

0.015 * 931.49406 = approximately 13.9724109 MeV.

So total is 5588.96436 +13.9724109 = 5602.93677 MeV, which is 5.60293677 GeV.

So E_rest is 5.60293677 GeV.

Gamma is 3.571428571.

So E_total = 3.571428571 * 5.60293677.

Let me compute that step by step.

Multiply 5.60293677 by 3.571428571.

Let me break this down.

5.60293677 * 3 = 16.80881031

5.60293677 * 0.571428571.

Wait, 0.571428571 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.60293677 * (4/7) = (5.60293677 *4)/7.

5.60293677 *4 = 22.41174708

Divide by 7: 22.41174708 /7 ≈3.20167815.

So total energy is 16.80881031 +3.20167815 ≈20.01048846 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option B is 23.069, option A is 18.475, option D is 21.419.

Wait, none of the options match 20.01. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is being considered as the sum of its nucleons? Let me think. Because sometimes in these problems, they approximate the mass as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy.

Wait, wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units, but perhaps I should look up the precise mass.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is 6.015 u, but let me check if I've considered the binding energy correctly. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. So, but in this problem, are we to take the rest mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons? Or use the actual mass of Li-6?

Wait, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus. So, perhaps the rest mass is the actual mass of Li-6, which is about 6.015 u. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate with precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact gamma value.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute 1 - (0.96)^2 again.

(0.96)^2 is (96/100)^2 = (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, as I thought. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571.

So E = 3.571428571 *5.60293677 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

Multiplying 5.60293677 by 3.571428571.

Hmm. Let me do it precisely.

3.571428571 is 25/7.

So 5.60293677 * (25/7) = (5.60293677 *25)/7.

5.60293677 *25:

5 *25=125; 0.60293677 *25=15.07341925.

Total is 125 +15.07341925=140.07341925.

Divide by 7: 140.07341925 /7 = 20.01048846 GeV.

So approximately 20.0105 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but that's higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015 atomic mass units. But perhaps the exact value is a bit different. Let me think of an exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the masses of the nucleons.

Wait, another approach: the number of nucleons in Li-6 is 6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons). Each proton has a rest mass of about 938.272 MeV/c² (exact value is 938.272 MeV). Neutrons are about 939.565 MeV/c².

So sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is less than this because of the mass defect (binding energy).

The mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units.

1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.494 MeV/c².

So 6.015 u = 6.015 * 931.494 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.015 *931.494 = 13.972395 MeV.

Total: 5588.964 +13.972395 = 5602.936395 MeV =5.602936 GeV.

So E_rest is 5.602936 GeV.

So when multiplied by gamma = 3.571428571 (25/7), we get:

5.602936 * (25/7) = (5.602936 *25)/7.

Compute 5.602936 *25.

5 *25=125, 0.602936 *25=15.0734.

Total 140.0734 MeV? Wait, 5.602936 GeV *25 =140.0734 GeV.

Divide by 7: 140.0734 /7 =20.0104857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0105 GeV.

But looking at the options, there's no option with 20.01. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma.

Gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

v=0.96c.

v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

Gamma =1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 more precisely. 0.96 *0.96 = (96/100)^2= (24/25)^2= 576/625= 0.9216 exactly.

So 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 3.571428571.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires the total energy, which is gamma * m c², but sometimes in collider experiments, the energy per nucleon is calculated, but in this case, the question is about the energy of the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, the question says the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates heavy ions. So the energy per ion is what's given in the options.

So the calculation I did earlier gives about 20.01 GeV, but none of the options is that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the mass number A=6, but the actual mass is 6.015 u, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for 1 u in MeV/c². Let me check: 1 u = 931.4940658 MeV/c².

So 6.015 u = 6.015 * 931.4940658.

Compute 6 *931.4940658 =5588.964395 MeV.

0.015 *931.4940658 =13.972410985 MeV.

Total is 5588.964395 +13.972410985 =5602.936805985 MeV =5.602936805985 GeV.

So E_rest=5.602936805985 GeV.

Gamma is 3.571428571.

E_total=5.602936805985 *3.571428571.

Let me compute that.

3.571428571 is exactly 25/7.

So 5.602936805985 *25 =140.0734201496 GeV.

Divide by 7: 140.0734201496 /7 =20.0104885928 GeV.

So about 20.0105 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the sum of the rest masses of the individual nucleons, not the actual nucleus mass.

Wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the nucleons because of binding energy. But when you use the sum, you get a larger rest mass.

So let me consider that approach. If the problem is using the sum of the rest masses, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton is 938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron is 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Now, E_total = gamma * m c² =3.571428571 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute 5.633511 *3.571428571.

Let me compute 5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.571428571.

Compute 0.571428571 as 4/7.

5.633511 *4 =22.534044.

Divide by 7: 22.534044 /7 ≈3.219149.

So total E_total ≈16.900533 +3.219149 ≈20.119682 GeV.

That's approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons, ignoring binding energy.

So in that case, the energy is approximately 20.12 GeV, which rounds to option C) 20.132 GeV.

But wait, the options list option C as 20.132 GeV. So why is there a slight discrepancy?

Let me compute more precisely.

If I use the exact masses:

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is exactly 25/7.

So E_total =5.633511 GeV * (25/7) = (5.633511 *25)/7.

Compute 5.633511 *25:

5 *25 =125.

0.633511 *25=15.837775.

Total=125 +15.837775=140.837775 GeV.

Now divide by 7:140.837775 /7=20.11968214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. The difference might be due to more precise values used in the problem, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons each moving at 0.96c, but that's not the case; the nucleus as a whole is moving at 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire nucleus, which is 6.015 u, leading to ~20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to sum the rest masses, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking up, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151226 u.

Wait, let me compute that.

6.0151226 u *931.4940658 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.4940658=5588.964395 MeV.

0.0151226 *931.4940658 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.4940658=9.314940658.

0.0051226 *931.4940658.

Compute 0.005 *931.4940658=4.657470329.

0.0001226 *931.4940658≈0.114258.

So 0.0051226 *931.4940658≈4.657470329 +0.114258=4.771728329.

So 0.0151226 *931.4940658≈9.314940658 +4.771728329=14.086669 MeV.

So total mass is 5588.964395 +14.086669=5603.051064 MeV=5.603051 GeV.

So E_rest is 5.603051 GeV.

Multiply by gamma 3.571428571.

5.603051 *25/7 = (5.603051 *25)/7.

Compute 5.603051 *25=140.076275.

Divide by7:140.076275/7=20.0108964 GeV.

Approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the binding energy and sum the rest masses of protons and neutrons, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the mass of the nucleus, such as 6.015 u, but that leads to about 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! That's a possibility. Because sometimes when people talk about the energy of a particle, they mean the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In particle physics, the collider's energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or sometimes the total energy. I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The RHIC typically accelerates heavy ions to a certain kinetic energy. But in some contexts, the energy refers to the total energy. I'm not sure, but let's consider both possibilities.

If the problem is asking for the total energy, E = gamma m c².

If it's asking for the kinetic energy, K = (gamma -1) m c².

So in that case, let's compute K.

Total energy E is 20.0105 GeV (from earlier calculation using actual mass). So K = E - m c² = 20.0105 -5.602936 ≈14.4076 GeV. But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, if using sum of nucleon masses: E_total=20.1197 GeV, K=20.1197 -5.633511=14.4862 GeV. Still not matching options.

So perhaps the question is indeed about the total energy.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

I calculated about 20.01 GeV using actual mass, and 20.12 GeV using sum of nucleon masses.

So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

But why is the option higher than my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of Li-6.

Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6. According to data, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151226 u. Let me use this exact value.

So m=6.0151226 u.

Compute m c²:6.0151226 *931.4940658 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.4940658=5588.964395 MeV.

0.0151226 *931.4940658=?

0.01 *931.4940658=9.314940658.

0.0051226 *931.4940658:

0.005 *931.4940658=4.657470329.

0.0001226 *931.4940658≈0.114258.

So total 4.657470329 +0.114258=4.7717283.

So 0.0151226 *931.4940658=9.314940658 +4.7717283=14.086669 MeV.

So m c^2 =5588.964395 +14.086669=5603.051064 MeV=5.603051064 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7=3.571428571.

E_total=5.603051064 *3.571428571.

Let me calculate this precisely:

5.603051064 *3.571428571.

I can compute 5.603051064 *3.571428571.

Let me compute as:

3.571428571 =3 + 0.5 + 0.071428571.

So,

5.603051064 *3 =16.80915319.

5.603051064 *0.5=2.801525532.

5.603051064 *0.071428571≈5.603051064 * (1/14) ≈0.400217933.

Wait, wait, 0.071428571 is approximately 1/14 (since 1/14≈0.07142857).

So 5.603051064 * (1/14)=5.603051064 /14≈0.400217933.

So add all together:

16.80915319 +2.801525532 =19.61067872.

19.61067872 +0.400217933 ≈20.01089665 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the binding energy and sum the individual rest masses of the nucleons.

So let me do that again.

3 protons:3 *938.272 MeV=2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3*939.565 MeV=2818.695 MeV.

Total:5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.571428571.

E_total=5.633511 *3.571428571.

Compute:

5.633511 *3=16.900533.

5.633511 *0.571428571.

Wait, 0.571428571 is 4/7.

So 5.633511 *4=22.534044.

22.534044 /7≈3.219149.

Total E_total=16.900533 +3.219149=20.119682 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-v²/c²)=1/sqrt(1-0.96²)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

But perhaps using more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, let me compute 0.96^2 =0.9216 exactly, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571.

So the calculation using sum of nucleon masses gives about 20.12 GeV, which is option C.

But why is the actual mass calculation giving 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of individual masses, leading to option C.

Thus, the answer must be option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) moves at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The velocity is \( v = 0.96c \). Substituting into the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.015 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5.603 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.603 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Consider the sum of nucleon masses
If the problem assumes the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), their masses are approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) for protons and \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) for neutrons. The total rest mass is:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using this value for \( m c^2 \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated energy using the actual mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \), but this is not one of the options. Using the sum of nucleon masses gives \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). Therefore, the problem likely assumes the sum of nucleon masses.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is approximately \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
