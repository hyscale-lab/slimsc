Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid with an inducible system, and they've introduced a tag—specifically, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tried to express the protein, it didn't work as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

The question is why they couldn't overexpress the protein. The options are A to D.

First, let me think about what each part of the construct should look like. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the coding sequence. The coding sequence would be from the ATG start codon onwards. Let me look at the sequence they provided. It starts with 5' ATG TAC CC... so the first codon is ATG, which is methionine—the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, CC is proline (wait, wait. Wait, TAC is tyrosine? No, wait. Let's think: TAC is actually tyrosine, right? Because TAC is T-A-C. The standard codon chart: TAC is tyrosine. So that's second codon. Then CC is proline? Wait, no. The third codon is CAT? Wait, no. Let me parse the sequence correctly.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... So:

ATG (start, Met)

TAC (Tyr)

CCA (Pro)

TAC (Tyr)

GAT (Asp)

GTT (Val)

Then CCA (Pro), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, wait a minute. The HA tag is a specific sequence, right? The HA tag is from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. Its sequence is typically: YPYDHHQALOSRGE. But wait, in the construct, they added the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence should start with the codons for the HA peptide.

Wait, but the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... So that's Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val...

Wait, but the HA tag's amino acid sequence is: YPYDHHQALOSRGE. So the first amino acids would be Y (Tyr), P (Pro), Y (Tyr), D (Asp), etc. So the first few codons should code for that.

So the first codon should be ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), then GAT (Asp), etc. Wait, but in the given sequence, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... So that would translate to Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val... So that actually aligns with the HA tag's first few amino acids. So HA is YPYD—so the first codons would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp). Wait, but the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... So that's Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp... which matches YPYD, right? Because Y is Tyr, P is Pro, Y is Tyr, D is Asp.

Wait, wait, so the HA tag's first few codons would be: TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D)... So the HA coding sequence is correct. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, if there's a mutation in the HA tag, like a wrong codon, the HA might not be recognized. But in the given sequence, the HA seems intact. So maybe that's not the issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream, perhaps. So the ribosome would stop before the actual protein is made. But the sequence starts with ATG and goes on for quite a while, and I don't see a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) before the end. Let me scan the sequence quickly. The sequence ends with ...CTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. Wait, the last few codons are TGA, which is a stop. So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct has the HA tag followed by the GADD45G, and ends with TGA as the stop. That's correct.

So the construct seems to have a start codon, the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence, and a stop codon. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. A linker sequence could be important for proper protein folding or to prevent protease cleavage. If the HA tag is directly attached without a linker to the GADD45G protein, maybe the cell's proteases are cutting it. For example, some tags require a linker (like a flexible one) to avoid being recognized as a signal for degradation or incorrect folding. Without a linker, the tag might cause the protein to misfold, and the cell's quality control might degrade it. Alternatively, some proteases might cleave between the HA and the next amino acids if there's a recognition site.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are read by the same machinery, which doesn't require a specific tRNA because they're not translated. So this option doesn't make sense. The presence of a stop codon (like UAA, TAG, TGA) is recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So D is incorrect.

So between options A, B, C.

Wait, looking again. Option B says the ribosome terminated early. But in the sequence, the stop codon is at the end, so unless there's an early stop somewhere, the ribosome would go all the way. Is there a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle of the sequence?

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. Let me scan through.

- TAC (no)
- ...GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let's look for TGA. Hmm, I see TGA in the middle: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATA GTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Ah, there's a TGA near the end, which is the stop codon. So the only stop codon is at the end. So the ribosome wouldn't terminate early; it would go until the end. So option B is not the issue.

Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. Looking at the HA coding sequence: the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... which is Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val... That's correct for the HA tag. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDHH..., so the first few codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTA (V), etc. Wait, no, the HA's amino acid sequence is YPYD..., so the codons would be TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D). So the provided sequence starts with ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT... so the first four codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D). So that's correct. So the HA tag is properly encoded. So A is probably not the issue.

That leaves option C. The lack of a linker could cause proteolysis. So when you tag a protein with HA or another epitope, sometimes a linker is added between the tag and the protein to prevent improper processing. For example, without a linker, the tag might cause the protein to misfold or might be recognized by proteases. So if the construct doesn't have a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, the protein might be cleaved by proteases during or after translation. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but without a linker, the proteases might cut the protein, so the HA tag is not present or the rest of the protein is missing. So when the researchers tried to affinity-purify (like using an anti-HA antibody), they didn't get the protein because it was cleaved. Alternatively, the protein might not be expressed at all if the processing is too problematic.

So, the correct answer is C. Because without a linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, the protein is being proteolysed, so the overexpression isn't happening as expected.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an HA determinant at the N-terminus, failed to express the protein. The provided sequence of the plus strand of the construct was analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   The HA tag sequence corresponds to the amino acid sequence YPYDHHQALOSRGE. The first few codons of the provided sequence (ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA...) translate to Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val..., which matches the expected sequence for the HA tag. Therefore, no missense mutation was identified in the HA tag sequence. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and ends with the stop codon (TGA). No additional stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) were found in the middle of the sequence. Thus, the ribosome would translate the entire sequence without terminating early. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Without a linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, the fusion protein may misfold or be recognized by cellular proteases. Proteases could cleave the protein, leading to the absence of detectable protein expression. This is a plausible explanation for the failure to overexpress the protein. This option is correct.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are recognized by release factors during translation, not tRNAs. Therefore, this option is irrelevant and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the failure to overexpress the protein is the lack of a linker sequence between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, which is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain.
