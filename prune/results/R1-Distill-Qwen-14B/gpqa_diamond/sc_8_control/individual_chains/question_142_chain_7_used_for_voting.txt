Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). 

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. Oh right, this is a diagonal matrix. Each of the terms |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors onto the computational basis states. So when you add them and multiply by 1/2, the diagonal entries become 1/2 each. 

Let me write this out in matrix form to visualize it better. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), right? The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. 

So the given ρ is (I + something)/2. Let me see: I is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I + matrix)/2. Comparing that, what's the matrix part? Oh, wait, in our case, ρ is (I)/2, because the other terms are zero beyond the identity. So the matrix part is just I. 

That would mean that the "something" in the general formula is zero. So r·σ must be zero. The Pauli matrices σ are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]] for x, y, z respectively. So if r·σ is zero, each component of r must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix would contribute to the sum. 

So r would be (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That makes sense because this state is a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin because it's maximally uncertain—it's like being in a uniform superposition in all directions.

Let me double-check. The density matrix ρ for a pure state |ψ><ψ| would have Tr(ρ²)=1, but in this case, since ρ has Tr(ρ²) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 +1/4= 1/2 <1, it's a mixed state. The origin in Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which for a single qubit is exactly (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

So the geometrical position is at (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), meaning all components of \( \mathbf{r} \) are zero. This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, \((0, 0, 0)\).

The state described by this density matrix is a maximally mixed state, which is consistent with its representation at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
