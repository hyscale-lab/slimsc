Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism, which I think is another term for optical activity or being chiral. The question gives me four organic compounds and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism entails. From what I recall, a compound can show optical isomerism if it has chiral centers, or if it has other forms of asymmetry like planar chirality, or maybe some other kind of asymmetry.

Looking at each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality. The substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetrical, maybe they don't cause any chirality. Let me think. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If there are two nitro groups on each ring and two ester groups (from the carboxylate), are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral?

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have a kind of chirality called biphenyl chirality, which arises from the arrangement of substituents around the central bond. For this to happen, the substituents on each ring must be in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image. If substituents are on the same side or opposite, maybe it's not chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, 6 on each ring would be across from the connecting bond, perhaps. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Are these substituents arranged in such a way that the entire molecule is not symmetrical? If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that when you mirror the molecule, it doesn't match, then it could have optical isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a binaphthyl system, which is known for having axial chirality. So maybe this compound has axial chirality, making it capable of optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. The propanoate ester is OMe-O-C-O-C-(CH3)CH2OH? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. But as the ester, it's methyl ester, so CH3CHOHCOOCH3.

Wait, but in the ester, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH3-C-OH

Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the ester group. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
CH3-C-O-OCH3
|
OH

Wait, no, the propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but with the OH on the middle carbon. So, structure is:

HO-CH2-C(O)-OCH3 ?

Wait, no, wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COO-OCH3? No, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is glycolic acid, right? So the structure is CH2(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain. So the structure is:

O
||
CH2(OH)-C-O-OCH3

Wait, but the central carbon (the one attached to OH and the carbonyl) would have four different groups: OH, carbonyl (as in the ester), methyl ester group, and the two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, no, the central carbon is the one with the OH; let me think again.

Actually, wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3)CH(OH)COOH. Oh no, wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's not possible because the second carbon from the COOH would be the middle one. Wait, actually, wait:

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would mean the OH is on the second carbon (the CH2 group in the middle). So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when made into an ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the structure, the central carbon (CH2 with OH and CH2COOCH3) would be attached to two CH2 groups, an OH, and the ester group. Wait, no. Let me count the substituents. The central carbon is the one with the OH.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

O
||
CH2(OH)-CH2-C-O-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The correct name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2 position would be the middle CH2. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon, so CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the methyl group)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and CH2? Wait, no. It's CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH group? Wait, no, the central carbon is the one with the OH and the ester.

Wait, the structure is: the central carbon is the one attached to the OH, so the groups are:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH2CH3?)
Wait, maybe I'm getting myself confused. Let me try again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule has the OH on the second carbon. So the central carbon (the OH one) is connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- an OH group
- the carbonyl group (from the COOCH3)
- another CH group, perhaps.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH) group.

That carbon is connected to:

1. CH3 (the first carbon)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (the third carbon)
4. And another CH group from the middle? Wait, no, no. The central carbon is the one with the OH. So the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester)
- and another CH2 group? No, perhaps I'm not seeing it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. No, that's not possible because the COOCH3 is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- a hydroxyl (OH)
- a carbonyl group (O)
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, but wait, maybe the central carbon is attached to four different groups:

In CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and the adjacent CH2? Maybe not. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH, which is connected to:

- CH3 (left side)
- OH (middle)
- COOCH3 (right side)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the CH (with OH). So the groups attached are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? No, wait. Wait, the central carbon, the one with the OH, has:

Left: CH3-CH(OH)-

Right: -(COOCH3)

But wait, that would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another CH, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, but that would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should just think about the presence of chiral centers. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have at least one chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another CH2? Or is it another group?

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH). So the substituents are:

1. CH3 (left)
2. OH (middle)
3. COOCH3 (right)
4. And a hydrogen? Or another CH group?

Ah, perhaps the central carbon is CH(OH), which is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- an OH group
- a carbonyl group (from the ester)
- and another CH2 group? Or is there a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the central carbon is CH, so the substituents are:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and a hydrogen.

If that's the case, then the central carbon would have four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That would make it a chiral center, so the compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

So for option 2, it should exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. Structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygens (from the ketone). So the groups are: two phenyls, one O (double bonded to C), and another O (as part of the ketone group). Wait, no, the structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is aryl groups. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two aryl groups and two oxygen atoms (but in a double bond). So the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O, and single bonds to two phenyl groups. So the substituents are:

- Phenyl (from one side)
- Phenyl (from the other side)
- O double bond
- and another O? No, wait. The carbonyl carbon is C=O, so it's sp2 hybridized. It's attached to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (one double bonded, one single bonded as part of the ketone). Wait, no, the ketone is O=C-O? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, benzophenone structure: two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is a ketone, so structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon (the one in the C=O) is attached to:

- Two phenyl groups (Ph)
- One O (double bond)
- And another O (as part of the ketone, but in a different position? No, wait. The central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. Wait, no, because the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the double bonded O. So its structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and has no other substituents. So it's not a chiral center because it's double-bonded (sp2 hybridized) and can't have four different substituents. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, with a trans configuration on the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, where the two COOH groups are esterified with methyl groups, resulting in two methyl esters on either end of the double bond.

Fumaric acid structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with the double bond. Wait, no, the structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, where the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents are trans.

So the dimethyl ester would be (CH2(COOCH3))CH=CH(CH2(COOCH3))? No, wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not right. Wait, fumarate is the trans-dimer of maleate. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond in the trans configuration? Or is it more like CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO(O)CH3?

No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the dimethyl ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO(O)CH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
   /
COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not the case. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups, and the two COOH groups on either end. So the dimethyl ester would replace each COOH with COOCH3.

So the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, wait. No, the double bond is between the two carbons that have the COOCH3 groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
CH2-CH2
    /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct because that would make a single bond. Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Let me think: fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on either end of the double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond. So it's COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle. Wait, no, the structure is COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is in the middle, and each end is a COOCH3 group.

In that case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides. The two COOCH3 groups are on either side of the double bond. So the structure is symmetric? No, because the groups on each end are the same. So if the substituents on each end are identical, then the molecule might not be chiral.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has a double bond with substituents that are not identical on each side, it could have geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are methyl ester groups on both ends. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is (CH2(COOCH3))CH=CH(CH2(COOCH3))? No, that would imply substituents on both ends.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
CH2-CH2
    /
COOCH3

But that would be a single bond, not a double bond. Oh wait, no, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that would be a single bond, so that's not fumarate. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Structure: HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H.

So dimethyl fumarate is the ester where both COOH groups are replaced by COOCH3. So structure: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's four carbons in a row, with the middle two being a double bond. So the structure is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle, making it COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, that would be five carbons. Wait, no, fumarate is butenedioate. So it's four carbons in total.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle. So it's COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Ah, yes. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. But wait, that's four carbons with the double bond between the second and third carbons. So the molecule is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)?

Wait, no, because that would have five carbons. I'm getting confused here. Let me count the carbons.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the molecule is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH=CH
|
COOCH3

But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But again, that's a single bond, which isn't correct. I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed with the thought that dimethyl fumarate has a planar chiral center or a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. The substituents on the double bond are two methyl ester groups and two hydrogen atoms. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

Wait, I think I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think about the properties. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and two ester groups. So if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if they are on the same side, perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, no. If the substituents on both ends are the same (like two COOCH3 groups), then the molecule is symmetric. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not chiral. Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a double bond with two identical groups on each carbon, like two COOCH3 groups on each end, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So it wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule would be meso or have a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think again. If the structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans form, then the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (two COOCH3), then the molecule would be symmetric and not chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's the diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not chiral because it's symmetric. So in the case of 4, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me go back to the other compounds.

So, to recap:

1. Biphenyl structure with substituents. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: perhaps no, but I'm uncertain.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4. So if 4 has optical isomerism, then this could be an option. But if 4 doesn't, then A is incorrect.

Option B: 3 and 4. We think 3 doesn't, and 4 is uncertain.

Option C: 2 and 3. 3 doesn't, so incorrect.

Option D: 1 and 2. If 1 has optical isomerism and 2 does, then D is correct.

Wait, so what about compound 4?

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure is (Z)- or (E)-, but does that create a chiral center? No, because the double bond is E, but the substituents are on each end.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the structure: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But again, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond in the middle. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that would be a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. No, maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are on the same side, perhaps it's a chiral molecule.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule would be symmetric, making it not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate might not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1. If the biphenyl has axial chirality, then yes.

2. Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So which options match?

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → If 4 is no, then A is incorrect.

B)3 and4 → 3 is no, 4 is no, so B is incorrect.

C)2 and3 → 3 is no.

D)1 and2 → 1 yes, 2 yes.

So the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.

But wait, let me confirm about structure 1.

Structure 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has nitro groups at 6 and 2 positions, and the connecting bond is at position 1 on each ring. So the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between C1 of each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at C6 and a carboxylate ester at C2.

Because the two substituents on each ring (nitro and ester) are in the same relative positions, I think the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other, then perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, but in biphenyl systems, the substituents on each ring can lead to axial chirality if their arrangement makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond.

In such a case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, and the two rings are connected at 1,1', then the molecule would be symmetrical. Because rotating the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond would swap the rings but leave the substituents in the same position. So no axial chirality, making it achiral.

So in that case, structure 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. That would mean that only structure 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2 correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

If 1 is no, 2 is yes, and 4 is no, then the only correct option would be D if 1 is yes, but if 1 is no, then none of the options match.

But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, leading to axial chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So, on each ring, the nitro is at 6, and the ester is at 2. These positions are across from the connecting bond (position 1). So each ring has substituents para to each other.

In such a case, when the two rings are connected, the arrangement of substituents could lead to a lack of symmetry. For instance, if on each ring, the nitro is on one side and the ester on the other, and the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents lead to a lack of internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, if each ring has substituents in the same positions, then the molecule would have a line of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged differently, perhaps not.

Wait, in compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So each ring has two substituents in para positions. So the entire molecule would be symmetrical, because rotating 180 degrees would swap the two rings but leave the substituents in the same positions. Therefore, the molecule would not be chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2 correct. Because the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So if only 2 is correct, none of the options match, which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating structure 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, then no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a meso compound. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in the trans (E) configuration.

Wait, but if the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the middle. So it would be achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule may not be chiral. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Structure 2 is chiral, but the options don't have a choice with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating structure 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have made a mistake with structure 4. Let me think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate again. The correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's four carbons: COOCH3, CH2, CH=CH, COOCH3. So the two COOCH3 groups are on the ends.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
    \
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
    /
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the center. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3?

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but arranged as:

CH2(COOCH3) - CH2 - CH=CH - COOCH3

But that's five carbons, which can't be right. I'm not making progress on this, so perhaps I should refer to general knowledge.

Dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons. So it's:

COOCH3
    \
CH2-CH=CH
    /
COOCH3

Wait, that can't be. Let me think of it as:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3 → No, that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2(COOCH3)-CH2=CH-CH2(COOCH3). Wait, that would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond in the center.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2=CH-CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, but in that case, the molecule is symmetrical. Both ends are identical, so the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, if the substituents on the double bond are the same on both ends, the molecule is symmetrical, so no chirality.

So, in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, which compounds have optical isomerism:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Looking at the options, none of the choices have only 2 correct. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → No, because 1 and 4 are incorrect.

B)3,4 → Both incorrect.

C)2,3 → 3 is incorrect.

D)1,2 → 1 is incorrect.

So none of the options match, which can't be correct. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has nitro groups at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. So substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

In such a structure, the two rings each have two substituents in para positions. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So that brings me back to the same conclusion: only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. What's the structure of dimethyl fumarate?

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that's four carbons, so it would be:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH=CH
   /
COOCH3

But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)

Wait, that's five carbons. No, fumaric acid is a four-carbon compound. So the correct structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's four carbons. So carbons are arranged as:

COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3

No, that can't be right because that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH=CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that doesn't make sense either. I think I'm stuck on this point, so perhaps I should proceed.

If dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. Otherwise, it is. Since I'm not sure, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing for the presence of stereocenters or geometric isomerism. But optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometric isomerism.

So, perhaps only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. The closest is option D: 1 and 2.

Wait, but if I'm wrong about compound 1, perhaps it does have optical isomerism. So, let's reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

In this structure, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring.

But the question is whether the molecule is chiral. Biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

In this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, when the two rings are connected, the substituents are both in the same direction relative to the central bond. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the 2 and 6 positions are such that the substituents are on the same face or opposite faces of the rings, leading to axial chirality.

Another way to think about it: if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule would be chiral. But if they are on opposite sides, the molecule would be achiral.

But in this case, since the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para positions, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule is symmetric. So no axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the molecule does exhibit axial chirality. In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if 1 and 2 are correct, then option D is correct.

But earlier, I thought 1 was not chiral, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an element of chirality in biphenyl compounds. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that create asymmetry, then the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they can't be superimposed on their mirrored counterparts.

In this case, if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions, and the connecting bond is at 1, then perhaps the arrangement of substituents leads to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Alternatively, if both substituents on each ring are in the same relative position (e.g., both on the same face of the ring), the molecule could be chiral.

But without a clear image, it's hard to say. However, for the purpose of this question, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4 or D)1,2.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is D)1 and 2.

But wait, another perspective: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate definitely has a chiral center, so yes.

Dimethyl fumarate: upon looking it up in my notes, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, but fumarate is trans, and maleate is cis. However, cis and trans are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. So, unless there's a chiral center, which there isn't, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that has optical isomerism is 2.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. It doesn't have any chiral centers. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake was elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 3. Benzophenone: does it have any chiral centers?

No, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)1 and 2, assuming that compound 1 does have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another possibility. Let me think about the biphenyl structure again.

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they can't be mirrored.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the substituents on each ring are on the same face relative to the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on opposite faces, making the molecule achiral.

I think the key here is whether the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In a biphenyl system, when substituents are in the same relative positions on each ring (like para positions), the molecule may be achiral. But sometimes, when substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a lack of symmetry. For example, if on each ring, the nitro and ester are on the same face of the ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

In that case, the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer would be option D)1 and 2.

So, in conclusion:

1. Yes (axial chirality)
2. Yes (chiral center)
3. No
4. No

So the correct answer is option D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which can arise from chiral centers or axial chirality in biphenyl systems.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1,1' positions, with nitro groups at the 6 positions and carboxylate ester groups at the 2 positions on each ring. Biphenyl systems can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically. In this case, the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) on each ring are in para positions, which can create a lack of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the OH group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. Since the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a trans double bond, and the substituents on each end of the double bond are identical (two COOCH3 groups). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry or lack of chirality.

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.

Answer: D
