Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I think I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have bromine in position 1 and a deuterium (which is like hydrogen but heavier) in position 2. So it's a benzene ring with substituents at adjacent positions—ortho positions.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think that's a common condition for elimination reactions, maybe E2 mechanisms. But wait, benzene rings are aromatic, so is this about aromatic substitution? Or maybe it's about elimination to form a double bond? Wait, but benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, wait a second. Benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. But in this case, the substituents are bromine and deuterium. Oh, but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate things. But wait, the deuterium is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (bromine). So, if we have a bromide and a deuterium next to each other, perhaps we're looking at a possibility of an elimination reaction.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: benzene rings can undergo substitution reactions. But NaNH2 is typically used in elimination, especially for dehydrohalogenation. So maybe this is an aromatic elimination. Oh wait, but aromatic rings are usually pretty stable. Maybe this is about forming a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But wait, benzene already has a conjugated diene structure. So perhaps the bromide is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to another substituent, allowing for the formation of a triple bond or something like that. Wait, but in aromatic compounds, substituents are on the ring, so perhaps the benzene ring itself isn't being modified in terms of its double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure. The molecule is 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2. So, the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. So, looking at the ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho). So, when we treat this with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it might abstract a proton. Wait, but the substituent is a deuterium, not a proton. So, can that be deprotonated?

Wait, wait. NaNH2 is used to deprotonate compounds, but in this case, the adjacent position has a deuterium, not a hydrogen. So, perhaps the base can't abstract that D because it's not a proton. Wait, but isn't deuterium just a heavier isotope of hydrogen? So, if the position 2 has a D, can NaNH2 abstract that? Or is it only abstracting protons?

I think that deuterons are less acidic than protons because they're heavier and form stronger bonds. But wait, in some cases, like in amide solutions, deuterium is abstracted more readily. Hmm. So, if the position 2 has a D attached, perhaps the base can abstract it. Or maybe not, because D is less acidic than H. Wait, but wait, the acidity of the proton in position 2 would depend on its environment.

In an aromatic ring, the acidity of protons can vary. For example, in para positions, the acidity is higher because the conjugate base is resonance-stabilized. But in the ortho position, perhaps it's less acidic. So, position 2 is adjacent to bromine, which is an electron-withdrawing group. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the alpha protons because the conjugate base is more stabilized.

So, in this case, position 2 has a deuterium adjacent to Br, which is an EWG. So, the deuterium's acidity might be higher than usual. So, perhaps the NaNH2 base can deprotonate (deuterate?) that position. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it can abstract that D.

If that happens, what would the product look like? So, if the D at position 2 is abstracted, we'd have a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a negative charge at position 2. But wait, benzene is aromatic and can't have a negative charge unless it's part of a resonance structure. So, the deprotonation would result in a benzene ring with a negative charge that can delocalize. But wait, wait, benzene already has a full conjugated system; adding another negative charge would require some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to an arenium ion or some other structure. Hmm, maybe the deprotonation would lead to a benzyne intermediate. Oh, wait a second, benzyne! I remember that when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehydrohalogenation, it can form a benzyne intermediate. But in this case, we have only one halogen and a deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the bromide is in position 1 and the deuterium in position 2. So, when the base abstracts the D, it could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 2. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton elsewhere, but wait, the substituents are Br and D in positions 1 and 2. Are there any other protons on the ring?

Wait, benzene has six positions. If positions 1 and 2 are substituted, the other positions (3,4,5,6) have protons. But if the base is strong enough, could it abstract a proton from, say, position 4? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. So, if NaNH2 takes a proton from a position that's adjacent to Br, perhaps that leads to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has double bonds. Oh, maybe it's not about the ring structure but substituents on the ring.

Wait, but the substituents are Br and D in ortho positions. So, perhaps the reaction is about substituting the Br. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, unless it's a dehydrohalogenation. So, maybe the bromide leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, C1 is attached to Br and C2 to D.

Wait, but if the D is abstracted, perhaps the C2 would lose a D and the Br leaves, resulting in a triple bond between C1 and C2? No, that's probably not right because benzene can't have triple bonds in the ring easily. Alternatively, perhaps the formation of a benzynelike structure, which is a triple bond between two adjacent carbons in the ring, leading to a diradical or something.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is o-bromo benzene with D in ortho. So, when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates a position. Wait, but the only available protons are on the ring at positions 3,4,5,6, because positions 1 and 2 are substituted. So, the base could abstract a proton from, say, position 4, which is meta to Br.

But then, would that lead to any elimination? Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, adjacent to position 3, but I'm not sure how that would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, but the only adjacent position is position 2, which has a D. So, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is next to position 1 (Br). Wait, position 1 has Br, so position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So, position 6 is ortho to Br and has a proton.

So, if the base abstracts the proton from position 6, and then the Br leaves, perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, that would make a double bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent (since benzene is a ring). So, that would make the ring have a double bond in that position, but benzene already has three double bonds.

Wait, but wait. Benzene has a delocalized ring of electrons, so adding another double bond would disrupt that. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond, making a benzyne (a diradical intermediate). Benzyne is a very reactive species. But wait, how does that happen?

I think benzyne is formed when two adjacent halogens are present, and upon elimination, a triple bond forms. But in this case, we have bromine and deuterium in adjacent positions. So, if the base abstracts the deuterium, then the bromide could leave, and perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, deuterium is harder to abstract than protons, right?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the base can't abstract the D, so no elimination occurs. But that can't be the case, because the reaction would then have no products, but the options don't have zero.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, perhaps a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2 is formed. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to a dienophile or some other structure.

Wait, another angle: NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic systems. For example, when you have a dihalobenzene, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 can eliminate two halides, forming a triple bond (benzyne). But in this case, we have only one halide and a deuterium.

If the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine, perhaps the bromide leaves, and a double bond is formed. Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (which is ortho to Br), then perhaps the H from position 6 is removed, and Br leaves, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but that would mean that the double bonds in the ring would adjust to accommodate the new double bond. So, the ring would have two double bonds, but that's impossible because benzene has three double bonds in a conjugated system. Alternatively, the ring would lose aromaticity, but that's unlikely because aromaticity is quite stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a single bond and a triple bond. Wait, but that's not possible because the ring can't handle that. So, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a diene. For example, eliminating Br and a proton from another position to form a conjugated diene. But I'm not sure how that would work in the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is replaced by something. Wait, but NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So, substitution reactions would require a nucleophile, but NaNH2 isn't providing one. So, it's more likely an elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, resulting in the loss of H and Br, forming a triple bond. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (which is adjacent to Br at position 1), but wait, position 2 has a D. So, the base can't abstract D, but maybe it can abstract a proton from position 3 or position 6.

Wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then Br at position 1 and H at position 6 would leave, forming a double bond. But in a benzene ring, that would create a double bond between C1 and C6, but that would disrupt the existing conjugation. Alternatively, maybe the ring adjusts to maintain aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the D at position 2 to be abstracted. Wait, but if the base abstracts the D, then Br leaves, and a triple bond forms. So, C1 and C2 would be connected by a triple bond, which would make a benzyne structure.

Wait, but benzyne is a very reactive intermediate. So, perhaps the product is a triple bond between C1 and C2, making a triple bond in the ring. But I'm not sure if that's considered a possible product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond because the deuterium is too hard to abstract. So, perhaps the base can't deprotonate position 6 either, because the acidity isn't high enough.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the possible products again. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then Br could leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, that would mean a new double bond is formed. Since benzene's ring is already conjugated, perhaps this leads to a diene structure, making the ring non-aromatic, but that's unlikely because aromaticity is more stable.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction forms a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so substitution is unlikely. Unless it's an elimination followed by some other process.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction isn't about the ring itself but about substituents on the ring. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are Br and D. Are they directly attached to the ring? Yes.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then lose Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, removing H and Br to form a triple bond. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br at position 1), then Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, that's only possible if the H is abstracted from a position adjacent to Br. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1.

If that happens, then the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene has six carbons, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent (since it's a ring). So, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6 would make the structure a triple bond between those two, which would mean the ring becomes non-aromatic, but that's not favorable. So, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br at position 1, perhaps the Br leaves, but that doesn't form a double bond adjacent to the base abstraction site. So, maybe that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no adjacent H to Br. The only adjacent position is position 2, which has a D. So, the base can't abstract that, so elimination can't happen. But that would mean no product, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is replaced by something else, but I don't think NaNH2 provides anything for substitution. So, that's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible products again. If the reaction is elimination, then the major product would be the formation of a triple bond (benzyne). But since the substituents are Br and D, perhaps the benzyne is formed between positions 1 and 2. But I'm not sure if that's possible because the D is in position 2.

Wait, another thought: If the D in position 2 is abstracted by NaNH2, that would leave a negative charge on C2. But that's not possible in a benzene ring because it's already an aromatic system. So, perhaps the abstraction leads to a resonance-stabilized carbanion, which then loses Br to form a triple bond.

Wait, but if the D is abstracted, what's left? Let me imagine: benzene ring with Br at C1 and D at C2. Base abstracts D from C2, leaving a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. That would form a triple bond, making a diradical or a very reactive structure.

But in reality, would that happen? I'm not entirely sure, but I think benzyne is formed when two halogens are adjacent, and upon elimination, a triple bond forms. But in this case, we have a bromine and a deuterium. So, perhaps it's not possible to form benzyne because we don't have another halogen adjacent.

Wait, but perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from another position. Let's say, the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to Br. Then, maybe elimination occurs, but I'm not sure where the Br would go.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form any product because the conditions aren't right for elimination. But that can't be right because the question is about possible products, implying that some reaction occurs.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products again. If the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and NaNH2 is added, the only possible reaction is elimination, which would require the loss of H and Br from adjacent positions. But in this case, the only adjacent position to Br is position 2, which has a D. So, perhaps the elimination can't proceed, and no product is formed. But the options don't have zero; the closest is option B) 1, which would imply only the starting material, but usually, the question would imply some reaction occurs.

Wait, but maybe the deuterium is abstracted, and that leads to some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to a different product.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the loss of H from C2. But C2 has a D, so that's not possible. Unless the D is abstracted, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br. Then, perhaps Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C3? But that's not adjacent, so that doesn't make sense for elimination.

Wait, elimination typically requires the leaving group and the abstracted proton to be on adjacent carbons. So, in this case, Br is at C1, and the only adjacent position is C2, which has a D. So, unless the D can be abstracted, elimination can't proceed. But D is harder to abstract than H, so perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, leading to no product. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1. So, position 6 has a hydrogen, and Br is at position 1. So, if H from position 6 is abstracted, and Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's a possibility.

Wait, so if that happens, would the product be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, making a diene? But that would require the ring to adjust its conjugation, which may or may not be favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring would lose aromaticity and form a non-aromatic compound, which is less likely. So, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, making it a monoene. But that's not possible because benzene's structure is rigid with three double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but I'm not sure. Let me think again about the possible products. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br, then the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and the ring would have five single bonds and one double bond. But that would disrupt the aromaticity, which is not favorable. So, perhaps that doesn't happen.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think about the number of possible products. The question asks how many possible organic products are formed.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between C1 and C6, that would give a product. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or position 4, leading to different double bonds. Wait, but elimination requires adjacent H and leaving group. So, only positions adjacent to Br can undergo elimination.

Wait, Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the only possible position is 6. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. That's one product.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 in a different way, leading to a different structure. Or perhaps, due to the symmetry, the product is the same regardless of which position the H is abstracted from.

Wait, but in o-bromobenzene, the positions are symmetric. So, abstracting a proton from position 6 would lead to a structure where the double bond is between C1 and C6, which is the same as between C1 and C2 if you rotate the ring. Wait, no, because position 6 is adjacent to position 1, but position 2 is also adjacent. So, if the ring is symmetric, the product could be the same regardless of which adjacent position is used.

But in this case, position 2 has a D, so the base can only abstract from position 6. So, only one product is possible.

Wait, but wait. When elimination occurs between C1 and C6, what's the structure? It would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's not possible because the ring already has double bonds. So, perhaps that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about what NaNH2 does in similar reactions. For example, in the dehydrohalogenation of toluene derivatives, NaNH2 can abstract a proton leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne). But that requires two halogens adjacent to each other. In this case, we have only one halogen and a deuterium. So, perhaps no elimination occurs, leading to no product. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question is about possible products, so perhaps the starting material is the only product. But that would mean zero products, which isn't an option.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a substitution. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So, unless it's a very strong nucleophile, which it's not, substitution is unlikely.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let's think about the options. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to the formation of only one product, the answer would be B)1.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to two possible products, but given the symmetry, perhaps only one product forms.

Wait, maybe the base can abstract protons from either position 4 or position 6, leading to different products. Because position 4 is meta to Br, and position 6 is adjacent. But wait, elimination requires the abstracted proton to be adjacent to the leaving group. So, only position 6 is adjacent to Br at position 1.

So, only one product is possible. Therefore, the answer would be B)1.

Wait, but why would position 6 be the only possible position for elimination? Because it's adjacent to Br. So, the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. But if that's the case, the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene already has double bonds. So, perhaps this forms a conjugated diene, but that would require the ring to lose aromaticity, which isn't favorable. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no product is formed. But that's not in the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzyne structure. But I'm not sure if that's possible with only one halogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about deuterium exchange. But I don't think so because NaNH2 is a base, not a source of deuterium.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, I think the reaction leads to one product. So, the answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 (ortho to the bromine).

Key considerations for the reaction:

1. **Deprotonation and Elimination**: NaNH₂ can abstract protons (or deuterium) from positions adjacent to the bromine. However, position 2 has a deuterium, which is less acidic than a proton and less likely to be abstracted. The adjacent position to the bromine at position 1 is position 2 (with deuterium) and position 6 (with a proton). Since position 2 is unlikely to undergo deprotonation due to the nature of deuterium, the reaction is expected to abstract a proton from position 6.

2. **Formation of a Triple Bond (Benzyne)**: Upon deprotonation at position 6, the bromine at position 1 can leave, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a highly reactive benzyne intermediate. This is the most plausible pathway for the reaction.

3. **Symmetry and Product Formation**: The molecule is symmetric, and the elimination process leads to a single product due to the fixed positions of the substituents. There is no possibility of forming multiple distinct products because the reaction mechanism is constrained by the positions of the substituents on the benzene ring.

4. **No Alternative Pathways**: Substitution reactions are unlikely because NaNH₂ is not a nucleophile. Additionally, the reaction does not involve aromatic substitution or rearrangement, as the elimination pathway is the most favorable.

Given these considerations, the reaction produces only one organic product, which is the benzyne intermediate formed by the elimination of bromine and a proton from position 6.

Answer: B
