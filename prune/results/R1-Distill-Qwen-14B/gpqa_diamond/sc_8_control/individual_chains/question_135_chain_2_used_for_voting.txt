Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV. We need to find its kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Let me look again. Oh right, the interaction term is written as -λ f f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the notation might be a bit confusing. Probably, f is a fermion field, like the Dirac spinor, and X is the boson field. So the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields multiplied by (v + X), implying that X couples to fermions.

So the Lagrangian term is something like λ (ψ_f)^dagger (something) (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe it's more like Yukawa coupling. The term would be something like -λ ψ ψ X, but I'm not entirely sure. But the key point is that X couples to fermions.

Now, for the decay of X, we want to see which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. Since X is a boson, it can decay into a pair of fermions (like a quark and antiquark or a lepton and antilepton) if the energy is sufficient.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the rest mass of X is 6 GeV, which is the energy available in the center-of-mass frame. For a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the produced particles must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in the rest frame of X, the energy available is 6 GeV, and the rest masses of the decay products must be less than that.

So let me think about the rest masses of the known fermions. Quarks have masses, but their current masses are usually considered. Let's list them:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (current mass)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, ~173 GeV (so X can't decay into top quarks)
- For leptons:
  - Electron: ~0.5 MeV
  - Muon: ~105 MeV
  - Tau: ~1.78 GeV
  - Neutrinos are negligible, but they're not charged, so X can't decay into them because the interaction term probably couples to charged fermions.

Wait, X is a boson, and the interaction term given is involving ψ_f, which are presumably charged fermions. So the decay products must be charged fermions. So possible pairs are quark-antiquark or lepton-antilepton.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible rest mass for each particle in the decay is 3 GeV, but that's only if the two particles are the same. Because if they are, each would be up to 3 GeV. Wait, no, no. Wait, when a boson decays into two particles, each particle has energy E, and the rest mass m. The condition is 2m ≤ M, where M is the mass of the boson. Because in the rest frame, the minimal energy each particle would have is their rest mass. So if each particle has mass m, then M ≥ 2m.

So for each pair, we have to check if 2m ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses.

Quarks:
- u: ~2 MeV → 2m ≈ 4 MeV → 6 GeV ≥ 4 MeV → allowed.
- d: ~5 MeV → 2*5=10 MeV → allowed.
- s: ~100 MeV → 2*100=200 MeV → allowed.
- c: ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 GeV → 6 GeV ≥3 GeV → allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 2*4.5=9 GeV → 6 GeV <9 GeV → not allowed.

So bottom quarks are too heavy. X can't decay into b bbar.

Similarly for leptons:
- e: 0.5 MeV → 2*0.5=1 MeV → allowed.
- mu: 105 MeV → 2*105=210 MeV → allowed.
- tau: 1.78 GeV → 2*1.78=3.56 GeV → 6 GeV ≥3.56 GeV → allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

uū, dđ, sš, c c̄, τ+τ−, e+ e−, μ+ μ−.

Wait, but the options in the multiple-choice don't include all of these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau, e+ e−. But wait, b is too heavy, so A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So all these are allowed except for the b. So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed because 2*1.5 GeV =3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So B seems correct.

Option C: Includes c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But top quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so X can't decay into t tbar. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, the interaction term? The Lagrangian given is coupling X to which fermions? Because the decay depends on the coupling as well. Because if the boson X doesn't couple to a certain fermion, that decay channel isn't allowed, even if the mass condition is satisfied.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the term is -λ f f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe it's more like -λ ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. But perhaps it's a Yukawa-like term, where X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

Wait, the term is written as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's more like λ ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. So X couples to ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, provided the mass condition is met.

But which fermions does X couple to? The problem says the interaction is given by that term, so X couples to ψ_f, which is a fermion. So the fermions are not necessarily all possible; the interaction is only for the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The interaction term is -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps this is a typo, and it should be ψ_f^dagger, or maybe it's written as f and ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the correct term is something like λ ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f, but with a mass term from ψ_f^dagger v ψ_f.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is:

L = -λ (ψ_f)^dagger (v + X) ψ_f.

Which would make it similar to the Yukawa interaction. So X couples to ψ_f, which is a Dirac fermion. So the decay of X would produce ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

Wait, but that would mean that X can only decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, but ψ_f is a specific fermion, perhaps a specific type, like a lepton or quark.

Wait, in the problem statement, the interaction is written as:

L(y) = -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Hmm, perhaps the notation is that f is a scalar function, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe f is a Dirac spinor, and the term is something like λ ψ_f ψ_f (v + X). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct term is λ ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa coupling.

In that case, X would couple to the fermion ψ_f, so X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

But in the problem statement, the interaction is written as involving f and ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps f is the field of a scalar (like a Higgs) and ψ_f is a fermion, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and both are the same fermion.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the interaction as X coupling to a specific fermion species. Let's say for example, X could be a scalar coupling to up-type quarks. But without knowing which fermion ψ_f is, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the problem is about the possible decay channels, so perhaps the interaction is such that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is met. Because the Lagrangian is written as having a coupling term to ψ_f, which is a fermion, but perhaps it's a general coupling.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the fact that the given Lagrangian allows X to couple to any fermion species, but perhaps the coupling is only to a specific one. Wait, but the way the Lagrangian is written, it's -λ f f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). It's unclear. Wait, perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, like the electron or a quark, and the interaction is only with that fermion. So X can only decay into that specific fermion and its antiparticle.

But the options suggest that X can decay into multiple fermion species, which would imply that X couples to all of them. So perhaps the Lagrangian is written in a way that X can interact with any fermion, not just a specific one. Alternatively, perhaps all fermions have the same Yukawa coupling to X.

Wait, but in reality, the Higgs field couples to all fermions with different Yukawa couplings, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the coupling is such that X can interact with any fermion, so any fermion pair is allowed, as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

So, putting that aside, let's get back to the mass condition. So, which fermions have rest masses such that 2m ≤6 GeV?

As I listed earlier:

u: 2 MeV → allowed.

d: 5 MeV → allowed.

s: 100 MeV → allowed.

c: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

b: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

t: 173 GeV → way too heavy.

For leptons:

e: 0.5 MeV → allowed.

mu: 105 MeV → allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

So the possible decay channels are into pairs of u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

So the possible decay products are uū, dđ, sš, c c̄, tau+ tau−, e+ e−, mu+ mu−.

Looking at the options, which one includes all of these except the too-heavy ones?

Option B says: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+tau−, mu+mu−, e+e−.

Yes, that's exactly the set we have. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C: has t, which is too heavy.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy.

So yes, the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the mass condition \( 2m \leq M_X \), where \( m \) is the rest mass of the decay products and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Condition**: For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of the fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the energy available in the rest frame of \( X \) is sufficient to produce the fermion-antifermion pair.

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Quarks**:
     - \( u \): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u = 4 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( d \): \( m_d \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d = 10 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( s \): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s = 200 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( c \): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( b \): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.
     - \( t \): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.
   - **Leptons**:
     - \( e \): \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e = 1 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 210 \, \text{MeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

3. **Decay Channels**: Based on the mass condition, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:
   - \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^- \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on the mass condition and the interaction Lagrangian.

Answer: B
