Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. We need to find out what the final product is, given its IR and NMR data. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I remember is around where a carbonyl (C=O) group would show up. So that suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 3400 area might be a broad peak for an -OH, which makes me think it's a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but wait, sometimes esters or other carbonyl compounds have lower wavenumbers. Let me think. Carboxylic acids typically have strong O-H stretches around 2500–3300 cm-1, appearing as broad peaks. The 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for a ketone maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an acid chloride, but the other IR peaks might help.

Looking at the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring with substituents. So maybe the compound is something like a benzoic acid derivative, since I see the 1720 cm-1 and the O-H stretch.

Now onto the NMR data. Let's go through the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but as a triplet or something, but the broadness here makes me think more of the -OH.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each ortho position would be equivalent and split into doublets. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each para to each other. Wait, but if it's para, then each pair of H is in the same environment. So for example, if there's a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4 of the benzene, the H's at 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and 3 and 5 would be another. Or maybe it's a substituent in one position, but that doesn't make sense with two sets of doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, like two substituents opposite each other. So let's imagine the benzene ring has two substituents at positions 1 and 3? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. For a 1,4 disubstituted benzene, the H's would be in such a way that each substituent is para. So for instance, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 4. The H's at 2 and 6 would be one set, and those at 3 and 5 another. So each set would split into a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent protons. So that fits with the NMR data of two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

Next, the NMR continues:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe from a CH group adjacent to something else. Could this be a CH group next to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group? Or perhaps a CH connected to an aromatic ring.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe from a CH2 group. Perhaps part of an ethyl chain or something like that.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a nitrogen, but since we don't have any NMR peaks in the 2-3 ppm range for NH, it's more likely a CH(CH3) group. Wait, the doublet suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH which is connected to something else. So maybe a CH(CH3) group adjacent to another CH2 or something.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. This is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group. So something like CH2CH3, where the CH2 is next to another CH.

Putting this together, the structure might be a benzene ring with two substituents, one in para position. One substituent is a methyl group, perhaps, and the other is a longer chain. Wait, but let me make sense of all the NMR signals.

The 10.5 ppm peak is the -OH of a carboxylic acid. So the benzene ring is attached to a carboxylic acid group. So maybe one substituent is a COOH group, and the other substituent is a substituent in the para position.

Wait, but how does that fit with the other NMR signals? The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to the COOH. Let me sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and another substituent at position 1. But wait, let's think about the substituents. So if it's a benzoic acid, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

Wait, but the NMR shows signals that suggest more than just a straight chain. Let's think about the substituents.

Another possibility is that the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something. Let me try to piece this together.

Wait, let's look at the substituents. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm, triplet (3H): that's a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps an ethyl group at the end of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm, doublet (3H): that's a CH3 attached to a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm, multiplet (2H): perhaps a CH2 group.

- 2.9 ppm, multiplet (1H): a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl.

So let's try to imagine the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent that's a propyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and then the COOH is another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but the COOH is an acid, so that would be at the end of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a butyl group attached in the para positions.

Let me think. If the benzene ring has a -COOH group at position 4, and a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a butyl group. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to the benzene. Then 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group connected to the CH. So that would make the substituent a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, but wait, how does that fit with the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H)?

Ah, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, let's think about it:

The substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. But wait, that would be a pentyl group? Or perhaps the substituent is a butyl group.

Let me try to think of the substituent as a butyl group. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typical for a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl chain attached to a methyl group, making a branching. Let me think, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)-, right? Wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl group is actually CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no. Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: a primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain. A sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group. Hmm. Let me think of the structure.

Wait, let's try to imagine the substituent as a propyl group attached to another group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a t-butyl group. But a t-butyl group would have a more complex NMR, perhaps a singlet for the CH3 groups around a central carbon. But in our NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H, which suggests only one CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH2 or something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group. So the substituent on the benzene is CH2CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that wouldn't make sense because then the COOH would have to be on the same carbon as the substituent, but that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2- group. So the substituent on the benzene is a CH(CH3)CH2- group, but then where is the COOH?

Wait, perhaps the COOH is part of the substituent. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propyl chain leading to a COOH group.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be CH2CH(CH3)COOH attached to the benzene ring. But then the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 for the terminal CH2CH3, a doublet at 1.4 for the CH3 attached to CH, then a CH2 group at 1.7, and a CH adjacent to the COOH at 2.9. Let me see if that makes sense.

So the structure would be benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - COOH.

Wait, but wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group ending in COOH? No, wait, it's benzene attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(CH3), then another CH2, and then COOH? No, that would make it longer. Hmm, maybe I'm not picturing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2 group, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options provided:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Structure would be benzene ring with ethyl at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2. That would make the substituents on the benzene at positions 2 and 4: ethyl and propanoic acid. Wait, but that's a 1,3-disubstituted benzene, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which would suggest para substitution, not meta. So maybe this isn't the right structure.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: That's a toluene derivative with substituents at positions 1 and 4. One is isobutyl (CH2CH(CH3)2?), and the other is methyl. But this structure doesn't have a COOH group, so the IR wouldn't show the O-H and the carbonyl. So B can probably be ruled out.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. Wait, benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a COOH group. So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, then the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). But wait, that would be a 1,4-dichlorobenzene type structure, which would have two substituents para to each other. The NMR would show two sets of aromatic protons as doublets, which matches what we have. So let's think about this structure.

So benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, leading to the two doublets in the NMR for the aromatic protons. Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent attached to the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but wait, wait, the substituent in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would be:

Benzene ring:

- Position 1: COOH
- Position 4: CH2-CH(CH3)- (but wait, that's a propyl group, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.)

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait no, that's a neopentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-, which would make it a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent on the benzene at position 4 is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH(CH3)CH2- as a substituent. Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The substituent for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's two carbons attached. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)-, but wait, that would make the substituent a 3-carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group, but with branching. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me try to think about the substituent's NMR.

The substituent's NMR includes:

- 0.9 ppm, triplet (3H): this is the end of an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. So probably a CH2CH3 at the end of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm, doublet (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm, multiplet (2H): a CH2 adjacent to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm, multiplet (1H): a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps.

So putting this together, the substituent could be a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but wait, how does that connect to the benzene and the COOH?

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, but how does that fit the NMR signals?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, which would be a 2-methylpropyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about the reaction given. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no. Wait, another reaction: the reaction of an alkyne with H2O and a catalyst gives a ketone, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to form the ylide for Wittig reactions. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. Wait, but in that case, the IR would show a strong peak for the C=O of the acyl chloride, like around 1800 cm-1. But in the given IR, it's 1720, which is closer to a carboxylic acid or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: the reaction of a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus would typically lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid. For example, RCN + HI (with P) → RCOOH + other products. So if Compound X is a nitrile, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid. But the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so the product would be the acid.

So perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but the initial structure of Compound X would have been a nitrile. So what would be the structure of X before reaction? Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is an alkyl chloride, and the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then the product would be an alkene, which doesn't match the options given, which all seem to be substituted benzenes with various substituents.

Wait, looking at the options, all of them except option A are substituted benzenes with either a COOH group or an isobutyl group.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent at position 4.

But wait, if Compound X is a nitrile, then when it's converted to the acid, that would form the benzoic acid. But how does the substituent get there? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a hydrolysis. Let me think again about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydroboration reaction or in the synthesis of alkenes from alkynes. Alternatively, in the case of the Stephen reduction, but that's for nitriles to amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another thought: when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an alkyne via the dehydrohalogenation. But that's more of a two-step process, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the NMR and IR data to figure out what Compound X is.

The IR shows a strong O-H (broad, 10.5 ppm in NMR) and a carbonyl (1720 cm-1). So that suggests a carboxylic acid.

So the structure of Compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. Now, the NMR indicates the substituent is an ethyl group with branching.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent must have:

- A terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet)
- A CH2 group (1.7 ppm, multiplet)
- A CH group (2.9 ppm, multiplet)
- A CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, doublet)

So the substituent is probably a CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group, but the NMR data suggests a shorter chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2- group. So the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Then the chain would be:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - COOH ?

Wait, no, because then the COOH would be part of the substituent. But wait, the COOH is on the benzene ring, so the substituent would be a side chain attached to the ring. So perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, a 2-methylpropyl group, which would be a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH is another substituent in the para position.

So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Which is option C. Let me check the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So if that's the case, then when Compound X (which has a nitrile group?) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes the acid.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the reaction part now. Wait, if the product is a benzoic acid, then perhaps Compound X was a benzyl chloride or something else. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure of Compound X is a nitrile that gets hydrolyzed to the acid.

Wait, but the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form the product. So I need to figure out what the product is after that reaction.

Wait, another approach: let me think about each option and see which one would fit the NMR and IR data.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure is benzene with ethyl at position 4 and a propanoic acid at position 2. The aromatic protons would be in meta positions, but the NMR shows two doublets, which would be para. So probably not.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is a toluene derivative with substituents at positions 1 and 4. But this doesn't have a COOH group, so the IR wouldn't show the O-H and the 1720 cm-1 peak. So B is unlikely.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The aromatic H would be in two doublets (since para substitution), which matches the NMR. The substituent's NMR would have the CH2CH3 (0.9, triplet), the CH2 (1.7, multiplet), the CH (2.9, multiplet), and the CH3 attached to CH (1.4, doublet). So this seems to fit.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, no COOH group, so the IR wouldn't match. So D is out.

So looking at the options, the only one that matches the IR and NMR data is option C. So the product after the reaction is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but why did the question mention the reaction with red phosphorus and HI? Because if Compound X is a nitrile, then after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the initial structure of Compound X is RCN, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes RCOOH. So the product would be the acid.

So putting it all together, the product is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of Compound X after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** indicates an O-H stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- The peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) group, further supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating an aromatic ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponding to a CH group adjacent to the aromatic ring.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet corresponding to a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, indicating a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

### Reaction Analysis:
Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. This reaction typically converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Therefore, Compound X likely starts as a nitrile derivative, which is converted into a carboxylic acid.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure has a propanoic acid group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4 on the benzene ring. However, the NMR data indicates two doublets for the aromatic protons, which would not match the expected splitting pattern for a meta-substituted benzene. This option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is evident from the IR and NMR data. The absence of an O-H stretch and a carbonyl peak rules out this option.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 on the benzene ring. The para substitution explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR. The sec-butyl group matches the NMR signals:  
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Terminal CH₃ of the ethyl chain.  
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: CH₃ attached to a CH.  
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: CH₂ group.  
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: CH group adjacent to the aromatic ring.  
   This option is consistent with both the IR and NMR data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, making it inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The only option that matches the IR and NMR data and is consistent with the reaction conditions is **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
