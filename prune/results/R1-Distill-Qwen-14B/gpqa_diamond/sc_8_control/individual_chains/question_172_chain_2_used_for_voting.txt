Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They mention that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the equation is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), but wait, actually E2 has higher energy than E1 if it's an excited state. Wait, no, wait. The equation is for the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. Suppose E1 is the lower energy level and E2 is higher. Then the number in E2 over E1 is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So, if E is the difference given, E = E2 - E1, assuming E2 is higher.

In the problem, it says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that means the population in the excited state (E2) is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me clarify: the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for that specific energy level, maybe it's the excited state? Or perhaps they're comparing the excitation in a specific level, so the ratio of the excited atoms to the ground state is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the ratio of the populations in two stars. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (E2) to the ground state (E1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. For star_1, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and for star_2, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

But wait, in the problem, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. So, (n2/n1)_1 is greater than (n2/n1)_2.

Given that, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2. Or maybe it's that the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let's denote star_1's ratio as R1 and star_2's as R2. So R1 = R2 * 2. Because star_1 has twice as many atoms excited in that level, so the ratio is twice.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm, I'm not sure if it's that the population is twice as high, or the excitation potential is twice. But since it's about being excited, I think it refers to the population ratio.

So, the ratio R is (excited state population)/(ground state population). For star_1, R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited, meaning their R is double that of star_2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that's not correct. Because R1 is the exponent for T1, and R2 is the exponent for T2. Wait, no: the ratio R is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), right? So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Given that, R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln(R1) = ln(2 R2) = ln(2) + ln(R2)

But ln(R1) = -ΔE/(k T1) and ln(R2) = -ΔE/(k T2)

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, that can't be right because the terms would be positive or negative. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, ln(R1) = ln(2 R2) = ln(2) + ln(R2). But R1 is exp(-ΔE/(kT1)), so ln(R1) is -ΔE/(k T1). Similarly, ln(R2) is -ΔE/(k T2).

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me rearrange this equation.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

Start with:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, no, my initial step was:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is that value. Let me think about the units. But perhaps the actual value of ΔE isn't needed because the options are in terms of T1 and T2 and involve ln(2), so perhaps the ΔE factors will cancel out.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are all about logarithmic relations between T1 and T2. So perhaps I can manipulate the equation to isolate terms involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let me see: we have,

( ΔE )/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2)

We can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

( ΔE/(k) ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the left-hand side is (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) equals ln(2).

Hmm, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k) to see what that gives.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, so ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait a minute, that's convenient. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Therefore, substituting that into the equation:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K.

Wait, but the left side is unitless, because T is in Kelvin, and we have (T1 - T2) in K, and T1 T2 in K². So (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is per K, but the right side is ln(2) divided by Kelvin. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, no, actually, since ΔE has units of J and k has units of J/K, so ΔE/k has units of K. So when we compute ΔE/(k) = 1 K, that's correct.

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1}) ?

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because the units on both sides should balance. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the equation.

We have:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) is in K, and (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is (K)/(K^2) )= 1/K.

So (K) * (1/K) ) = unitless, which matches the right-hand side, which is ln(2) (a pure number). So that works.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k)) )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, as I found earlier, this reduces to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, no, because ΔE/(k) is 1 K, so the equation becomes:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that would imply (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K. Which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, maybe I should take it back. Let me just focus on the equation again without units:

We have:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) is 1 (units cancel to K, but since ΔE is in J, which is (kg m^2/s^2), and k is J/K, so ΔE/k is K, as we said before). So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K, then:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that would give:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K)

But that can't be, because the left side is in 1/K, and the right side is ln(2) (unitless) divided by K. So perhaps I've made a wrong substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not substitute the value of ΔE/k. Let me proceed symbolically.

We have:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since (ΔE/(k)) is 1 K, as we found, substituting that,

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that can't be correct because the left side would have units K*(1/(K^2)) )= 1/K, and the right side is unitless. So I must have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that ΔE/(k) is 1 K. So, the equation becomes:

(1 K) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that would mean:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K

Which gives:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) / (1 K)

But that doesn't make sense as the left side is 1/K, and the right is 1/(K), so units do match. Hmm, perhaps. But wait, it's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed without substituting the value. Let me think of the equation as:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, ΔE/(k) is a constant, so perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of T1 and T2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k))

Since ΔE/(k) is 1 K, this simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that matches. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is used to relate the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature of the system. The equation is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios are given by:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning \(R_1 = 2 R_2\). Substituting the expressions for \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the terms involving \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), the ratio \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
