Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are involved here.

The given components are Px, Py, and Pz. Let's write down what each of them is. Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) multiplied by [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) multiplied by [1 0; 0 -1], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, but what's the operator P in terms of these components? Oh, I think P is the angular momentum operator in the direction of n. So, if n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, φ might be zero or something. Wait, no, more accurately, since it's in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized by θ where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. Wait, if n is in the x-z plane, then the direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Now, the operator P along direction n is given by P = n · (Px, Py, Pz), right? Because for angular momentum, the operator in direction n is the dot product of n with the components. So P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz.

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Substituting the values, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So P = sinθ (ħ/2) σx + cosθ (ħ/2) σz, where σx and σz are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So putting it all together, P is (ħ/2)[ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ].

So P is a 2x2 matrix. Let's write that out. 

sinθ σx is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]], and cosθ σz is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]. So adding them, we get:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, multiplying by ħ/2, P becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write this equation out. Let the eigenvector be a column vector [a; b].

So,

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me write these equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a  
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0  
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0 

Wait, wait, equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the equations as:

From equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0  
From equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So, the system is:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0  
sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system, so for non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. But perhaps it's easier to solve one equation for one variable and substitute.

Let me take equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Simplify sinθ/(1 - cosθ). Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Alternatively, a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2) → a = b cot(θ/2).

So, the eigenvector components are proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]. Let's write the vector as [ cot(θ/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(θ/2); 1 ].

But we want the eigenvector to be normalized. So the magnitude squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 (cot²(θ/2) + 1) ) = |b|^2 (csc²(θ/2)) ) = |b|^2 / sin²(θ/2) ) = 1.

So |b|² / sin²(θ/2) =1 → |b| = sin(θ/2). Let's take b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2 ) = cos(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ].

Wait, but wait. Are these real numbers? Because in the options, there are complex numbers too. For example, option B has e^{iφ} in the second component. So, maybe I made a mistake because in some cases, the eigenvectors could have complex components.

Wait, but in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so maybe the state doesn't require complex components? Or perhaps I should think of the general case.

Wait, alternatively, the eigenvector might be written in terms of spherical harmonics, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(θ/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(θ/2) ] ?

Wait, no, that's option D. Wait, but in my calculation, I don't see any ħ in the components. Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because the operator has dimensions of ħ, but eigenvectors are vectors without dimensions. So options with ħ in them might be wrong. Let me look at the options.

Option A: (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ) → that's including ħ, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector. So probably not.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ) → this looks like a spherical harmonic, perhaps for spin-1/2. But the eigenvector I found is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Option C: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) → this matches what I found, but it's not normalized. Wait, no, wait. My calculation showed that the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, wait, no, in the calculation I did, the components are [a, b] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. Because when I set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). So the vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], and that's normalized because cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, but I'm forgetting that in the operator P, the direction is arbitrary and may involve angles, but the eigenvector depends on θ/2. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches.

Option D: something with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by ħ and sine terms.

Wait, but I don't see where those factors come from. Unless I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the system of equations.

The equations after substitution were:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0  
sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Which simplifies to a = [sinθ/(2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] * [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ]? Wait, let me re-derive that.

(1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the vector [a, b] is [ cot(θ/2) b, b ] = b [cot(θ/2), 1].

To normalize, the magnitude squared is (cot²(θ/2) + 1 ) |b|² = csc²(θ/2) |b|² =1 → |b|= sin(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], correct.

So the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

Wait, but option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, what are the options given?

Option C says, "(cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))". So that's exactly what I found.

But let me check the other options.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). That seems like a different form. Why would there be sqrt factors there?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the operator is a combination of Pauli matrices, perhaps the eigenstates are not just the simple [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] but involve some other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps theta is the angle of the direction vector n, but the eigenvector is as I found.

Wait, another thought: the spin-up state in the direction of n is given by the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So yes, I think option C is correct.

But wait, the options say "elements of the normalized eigenvector." So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which are real numbers. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I have. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (\vec{P}_x, \vec{P}_y, \vec{P}_z)$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane. Substituting the components of $\vec{P}_x$, $\vec{P}_y$, and $\vec{P}_z$, the operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Explicitly, $\vec{P}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle$ is solved for the eigenvector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting into the eigenvalue equation and simplifying, the system of equations becomes:

\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. To normalize the eigenvector, the components are scaled such that $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$, the normalization condition gives $|b| = \sin(\theta/2)$, leading to:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of the normalized eigenvector given in **Option C**. The other options are inconsistent with the derived solution. For example:
- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B** introduces a complex phase $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary for this real eigenvector.
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors like $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which do not appear in the derived solution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
