Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems. The coefficients here are complex numbers, so I'll need to normalize the state first, I think.

The next part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij: Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-1/2. Let me try to write that matrix out.

The matrix for operator A would then be:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero because Aij is zero when i equals j. So yes, it's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because |up> and |down> are two basis states. So the matrix is 2x2.

Wait, but this matrix looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply that by hbar/2, you get the matrix I just wrote.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvectors are the same as for their scaled versions.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1. So when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2, because (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2. So the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |–x> states, which are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) * σx.

So, the first step is to find the probabilities of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates (|+x> and |–x>), and the average value of the operator.

But before that, I think I need to normalize the given state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So let me compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me denote this as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b = (2 -i).

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. Let's compute |a|^2: |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |b|^2 is |2 -i|^2. The real part is 2, the imaginary part is -1, so (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the state is proportional to these coefficients, so the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, the state is normalized. So |alpha> = (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

The next step is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |–x>, which are the eigenstates of σx.

I remember that the eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that. Oh wait, no, wait. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |–x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think: σx |+x> = (+1)|+x>, and σx |–x> = (-1)|–x>.

So, the state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |–x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), I think. Wait, wait: no, wait, no. Wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin. So, when you apply σx to |up>, you get |down>, and vice versa. So the |+x> state is an equal superposition of |up> and |down>, and similarly for |–x>.

So, let me write |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |–x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but wait, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2) for each. So, I'll need to express |alpha> in terms of these states.

So, let me express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |–x>. Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2), and |–x> = (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2).

So, |alpha> can be written as c1 |+x> + c2 |–x>.

Let me compute c1 and c2.

We have |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |–x>, this becomes:

|alpha> = [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] |+x> + [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] |–x>.

Wait, because |up> = (|+x> + |–x>)/sqrt(2), and |down> = (|+x> - |–x>)/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x>. Let me set up the equations.

Let me denote |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |–x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, this is:

c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [c1 + c2]/sqrt(2) |up> + [c1 - c2]/sqrt(2) |down>.

But we know |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So we can equate the coefficients:

[c1 + c2]/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
[c1 - c2]/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these equations as:

c1 + c2 = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
c1 - c2 = (2 -i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

So, let's compute these:

Equation 1: c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: c1 - c2 = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Adding the two equations:
2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, (1+i) + (2-i) = 3 +0i = 3. So yes, when adding the two equations, 2 c1 = 3 * sqrt(2/7) => c1 = (3 sqrt(2/7)) / 2.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[Equation 1] - [Equation 2]:
2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= [ (1-2) + i +i ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps instead of solving for c1 and c2, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |–x> to find the coefficients, which would directly give me the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of operator A.

The operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |–x>, as I thought earlier. So the probability of measuring the system in state |+x> is | < +x | alpha > |^2, and similarly for |–x>.

So, let me compute < +x | alpha >.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * < up | + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * < down | ] * (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, more accurately, < +x | alpha > is the inner product, which is:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * < up | +x > + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * < down | +x >.

But we know that < up | +x > = 1/sqrt(2), because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, < down | +x > is also 1/sqrt(2).

So, this inner product becomes:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)).

Factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

[ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1+2 =3, i -i=0. So 3.

So, < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait, that's the inner product. The probability is the modulus squared of this.

So, the probability P(+x) is |3/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 9/14.

Similarly, the probability P(–x) is | <–x | alpha > |^2.

So, let me compute <–x | alpha >.

The state |–x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, <–x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * < up | –x > + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * < down | –x >.

We know that < up | –x > is 1/sqrt(2), and < down | –x > is (-1)/sqrt(2).

So putting it all together:

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1/sqrt(2))
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

Simplify numerator:

1 -2 = -1,

i +i = 2i.

So, [ -1 + 2i ] / (sqrt(14)).

So, the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The modulus squared of this is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (14).

Compute | (-1 + 2i) |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So P(–x)=5/14.

Wait a second. Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which makes sense as probabilities.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximately 9/14 and 5/14. So that's probably the probabilities part.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, I might have made a miscalculation.

Let me recheck the inner product for |+x>:

< +x | alpha > = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1/sqrt(2)

So, adding the two terms:

(1+i +2 -i) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) = (3)/sqrt(14) → correct.

So the modulus squared is 9/14, which is approximately 0.642857.

Similarly, for <–x | alpha >:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )

= (1 -2 +i +i ) / (sqrt(14)) ) → (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

So yes, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), which matches option A's first two values (0.64 and 0.36).

Now, for the average value of the operator A. The operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, since it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1.

The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, we can compute it using the eigenstates and their probabilities.

We can also compute this as the expectation value using the basis |up> and |down>.

But perhaps it's easier to write the matrix of operator A and compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix of A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, we can write:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Where the first part is the conjugate transpose (bra) and the second is the ket.

Multiplying it out:

The product of the bra and A and ket.

Let me compute matrix A multiplied by the ket vector.

The ket vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

A multiplied by this is:

For the first component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply this with the result of A|alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So each term:

First term: (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (1 -i)(2 -i) (hbar/2) /7.

Second term: (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (2 +i)(1 +i) (hbar/2) /7.

So adding these together:

Total = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] * (hbar/2) /7.

Compute each product:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2. i^2 is -1.

So: 2 -3i + (-1) = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2. i^2=-1.

So: 2 +3i + (-1) = 1 +3i.

Now, adding these two results: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So the total becomes 2 * (hbar/2) /7 = (2 * hbar) / (14) )= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third value.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

So, all three parts match option A.

Wait, but let me just check if there's an alternative approach, perhaps using the eigenvalues and probabilities.

The operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2. The probability of measuring +hbar/2 is 9/14, and -hbar/2 is 5/14.

So the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) hbar ] / (14 *2) )= (4 hbar)/(28) )= hbar/7.

Yes, that matches. So the average is indeed hbar/7.

Thus, the correct option is A.

The problem involves a quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \), proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]
The normalization factor is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are given by \( P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \) and \( P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 \).

#### Compute \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### Compute \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \), compute:
\[
\langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right] \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]
Simplify the terms:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i.
\]
Adding these gives \( 1 - 3i + 1 + 3i = 2 \). Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
