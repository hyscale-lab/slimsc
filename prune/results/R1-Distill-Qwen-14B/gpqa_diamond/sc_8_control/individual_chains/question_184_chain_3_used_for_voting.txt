Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions from options A to D leads to this compound starting from benzene.

First, let me draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait, but in numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, let me imagine the substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or maybe I should think about the numbering correctly. Oh, wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but the numbering might vary based on which substituent gets the lowest number.

Wait, let me clarify. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: at position 1, ethoxy; at position 2, tert-butyl; and at position 3, nitro. So in the ring, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, in that order. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, when numbering the substituents on a benzene ring, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the numbering should be such that the substituents are in order of priority. Wait, the substituents are nitro, ethoxy, tert-butyl. According to IUPAC rules, the substituents are numbered based on their priority. The priority order is: nitro (-NO2) is higher than ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) which is higher than tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3). So the highest priority group is nitro. So the numbering should start from the nitro group.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible set of numbers, regardless of priority. But the substituents with higher priority should be considered first when numbering to get the lowest numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the numbering is 1, 2, 3. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). But perhaps it's more logical to number such that the highest priority group gets the lowest number. So, nitro is highest, so it's position 1, then ethoxy and tert-butyl. Wait, but in the name, the nitro is at position 3. Hmm, perhaps the numbering is fixed based on the substituents' positions as given in the name.

Alternatively, perhaps the name is written in a way that the substituents are in a specific order. Let me think: the parent is benzene. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in the ring, substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

So, the ring has three substituents in the 1,2,3 positions. Now, the key is to figure out the reaction steps needed to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

The starting material is benzene. I'll need to perform electrophilic substitutions. The order of substitution will determine the positions of the groups.

Let me think about each substituent and when they should be introduced.

First, nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, deactivating group (since it's an alkyl group, but alkyl groups are activating, but wait, no, tert-butyl is a bulky group but it's actually an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via induction). Wait, no: alkyl groups are activating, but they are ortho/para directors. Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the substituent is introduced, and it's activating, but in the case of tertiary butyl, being bulky may affect the substitution pattern.

Wait, but in terms of directing, tert-butyl is an activating group (donating electrons through sigma bonds) and is an ortho/para director. So, when a substituent is introduced, the next substituent would come in based on the directing effect of the existing substituents.

But in our target molecule, the substituents are at 1,2,3 positions. That's a meta arrangement for the nitro group relative to the ethoxy group. Hmm, but this might not be the correct way to look at it.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents matters. Let's think about each substituent and when to add them.

Let me think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): this is an activating group, ortho/para director.

- tert-Butyl group: activating, ortho/para director.

- Nitro group: deactivating, meta director.

So, the nitro group is a meta director, which complicates things because when you add a nitro group, the next substituent may end up in a meta position relative to it.

But in our target, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents is important. Let me think about the possible synthetic routes.

Optionally, the substituents can be added in any order, but each addition will affect the next substitution.

Let me consider the possible steps:

One possible approach is to first install a substituent that's a meta director so that the next substituent can be added in the correct position.

But in this case, the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating, so they will direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions.

But we have a nitro group which is deactivating and meta-directing. So, if we add the nitro group after adding an activating group, it could direct the next substituent to a specific position.

Alternatively, adding the nitro group first would be a possibility. Let's see.

Wait, but nitration is usually done under certain conditions. For benzene, nitration with HNO3 and H2SO4 would introduce a nitro group in the meta position relative to any existing activating groups, but if the benzene is unsubstituted, the nitration would give a meta director for the next substitution.

Wait, no. Wait, if benzene is first nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, which is meta-directing. Then, adding another substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

But our target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's think about how each substituent is added.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents in the order of their introduction. Let's consider that the ethoxy group, tert-butyl, and nitro group are added in some order.

But perhaps the ethoxy group is added first. Let's think: if I first introduce ethoxy, then the ring is activated, so the next substitution (say, nitration) would occur ortho, para to ethoxy. But then, adding the tert-butyl group would be influenced by the ethoxy and nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps we should add the nitro group first, then add the ethoxy group, which as an activating group would direct the next substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then do Friedel-Crafts alkylation, then introduce another group.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3. But the presence of strong deactivating groups (like nitro) would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Wait, no. Nitro is a deactivating group, so if I have nitro on the benzene ring, adding another group via Friedel-Crafts (like tert-butyl) would be challenging because the ring is deactivated.

So, perhaps the order should be to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating groups.

But wait, that may not work because once a deactivating group is added, the ring becomes less reactive, making further substitutions harder.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro group.

But wait, let's think: adding ethoxy (an activating group) first.

Benzene + ethoxy group via, say, an ether synthesis—wait, benzene can't directly form an ether. Oh, wait, I think the ethoxy group can be introduced via alkylation, but wait, no, alkylation of benzene would typically be through Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But ethoxy is an ether group, not an alkyl group. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm confusing Friedel-Crafts alkylation with something else.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups (like tert-butyl). For introducing an ether group, perhaps it's better done through a different method. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic substitution, but that's not typical for benzene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction. But benzene itself is not reactive enough for that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strong activating group already present on the ring.

So, perhaps the order is to add the ethoxy group first, then add the tert-butyl group, and then add the nitro group.

But wait, let's think about each step.

First, adding ethoxy group to benzene. How?

Benzene can undergo alkylation, but that would introduce an alkyl group, not an ether. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a Williamson ether synthesis approach. Wait, no, that's for making ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides, but how would that apply to benzene?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strong activating group. So perhaps the ethoxy group is added after another substituent that activates the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide as the electrophile. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses alkyl halides with a good leaving group, like AlCl3 as a catalyst. So, benzene + ethyl bromide + AlCl3 would give ethyl benzene. But that's an alkyl group, not an ether.

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group, which is an ether. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using an ethyl bromide and a strong base, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by some reduction, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each reaction step in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of reactions. Let's focus on the options and see what each step is.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation? Wait, that might be sulfonation, but wait, SO3 is typically for sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. But in some cases, sulfonating agents can be used as activating groups.

But wait, in the target, I don't see a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps this step is not part of the target structure. Hmm, maybe I should think that steps are not all part of the target but steps in the synthesis.

Wait, perhaps the options have more steps than needed, but the correct steps to reach the target.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps are protection or deprotection steps.

Hmm, getting back to the problem. Let me think about the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, to get this, maybe the steps would involve:

1. Introduce ethoxy group in position 1.

2. Introduce tert-butyl group in position 2.

3. Introduce nitro group in position 3.

But the order of these steps matters because each substituent affects where the next one goes.

Alternatively, another approach is to use directing groups. Let me think: if I first add a group that directs the next substitution to the desired position.

Wait, perhaps let's consider adding the nitro group last because it's a strong deactivating group, and once added, it affects the positions for further substitutions. So maybe the other groups are added first, and then the nitro.

But the nitro group is in position 3. So, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are in positions 1 and 2, and then the nitro is added in position 3. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, but then the ring is activated enough to add the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So adding ethoxy and tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts might not be feasible.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: first add the ethoxy group, which is activating, then add the nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy. Then, add the tert-butyl group in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Let me think: benzene → add ethoxy (using some method) → then nitration would occur at meta position relative to ethoxy. So, if ethoxy is at position 1, nitro would be at position 3. Then, adding the tert-butyl group would occur at position 2 if directed by the ethoxy and nitro groups.

Wait, but tert-butyl is an activating group. Once ethoxy is at 1 and nitro at 3, where would the tert-butyl group add?

The ethoxy (position 1) is ortho/para-directing. The nitro (position 3) is meta-directing.

So, looking at the ring, the available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, if ethoxy is at 1 and nitro at 3, the positions that are ortho to ethoxy are 2 and 6. The para is 4. The meta to nitro would be positions 6 and maybe others.

Wait, perhaps the tert-butyl group would be added at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to nitro (position 3). But nitro is deactivating, so it's a meta director, so it would direct incoming groups away. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and nitro, the next substituent would be added in the position that is ortho to ethoxy (position 2) because ethoxy is a stronger activating group, so it would dominate the directing effect.

Alternatively, the presence of the nitro group (a deactivating, meta-directing group) would influence where the next substituent goes.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is meta to ethoxy, so positions 3 and 5 (if ethoxy is at 1). So nitro at position 3.

Then, adding the tert-butyl group: the ethoxy directs ortho and para. So the available positions are 2 (ortho to ethoxy, which is at 1), 4 (para to ethoxy), and 6 (ortho to ethoxy, which is at 1). But the nitro group is at 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

Wait, the tert-butyl group might be added at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro. But I'm not sure about the actual regiochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group being at position 3 would make the ring less reactive in some regions. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the options provided and see which sequence could lead to the target.

Looking at the options:

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr

Wait, this seems complicated. Let's break down the steps.

Option D: First step is nitration. So, benzene nitrated gives nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl is a reagent for what? Maybe for something like a coupling reaction or for reducing. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's for a substitution.

Wait, Fe/HCl is often used in the Sandmeyer reaction, but that's for converting aryl diazonium salts to other substituents. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for some kind of reduction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option step by step.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl: not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt, perhaps to a phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: perhaps an alkylation, like Williamson.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4: perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm, not sure. This seems to involve multiple nitrations, which might not be necessary.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: adds tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, again, multiple steps, including sulfonation, which may not be part of the target.

Wait, the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so any steps involving SO3/H2SO4 might be for something else, maybe for activating the ring for another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is used as a directing group and then removed.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this differently.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). These groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

To get these substituents in the correct positions, their order of addition must be such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

One possible synthesis route is:

1. Add the ethoxy group first. But how? Benzene can't directly form an ether. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated. So maybe we first add a strong activating group, then substitute it with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via alkylation using a strong activating group. But I'm not sure about the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the ring has been activated by another substituent.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide and AlCl3. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually introduces an alkyl group (like ethyl), not an ether. So that would give ethyl benzene, but not ethoxy benzene.

Ah, right, so perhaps I need another approach to introduce the ethoxy group. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction using an ethyl group. But benzene itself is not reactive enough for that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strong activating group, such as a nitro group, which directs the incoming nucleophile to the meta position relative to itself.

Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, making the ring less reactive. So perhaps that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a directing group that is then removed. For example, using a sulfonic acid group as an activating, strong directing group, which is then replaced by the ethoxy group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce a sulfonic acid group (e.g., via sulfonation) to activate the ring.

2. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. For example, introducing an acetyl group, then reducing it to a methyl group, but that doesn't directly give an ether.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Let me look at option D again.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrates benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: possibly a reduction or a substitution.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4: hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat: perhaps acid hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: perhaps an alkylation.

Wait, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and sulfonations, which may not be part of the target structure. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl: maybe a substitution.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) H3O+, etc.: hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: alkylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4: hydrolysis.

Hmm, multiple nitrations again. Since the target has only one nitro group, perhaps this isn't right.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl: not sure.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O: hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: alkylation.

Hmm, again, multiple nitrations and sulfonations. The target has only one nitro group, so perhaps this is not the correct option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazo.

v) H3O+/H2O: hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH/EtBr: alkylation.

vii) Fe/HCl.

viii) HNO3/H2SO4.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, again, multiple nitrations. Maybe not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in the options that would introduce the necessary groups.

Looking for steps that introduce ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Wait, in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Perhaps the correct order is to first add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how?

Wait, let's think: benzene → add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) → then add ethoxy (another Friedel-Crafts? But ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. Hmm, that's a problem.)

Wait, perhaps after adding the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts, the next step is to introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution. But again, benzene derivatives are not typically reactive enough for that without a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by some reduction, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that requires a good leaving group on the benzene ring, which isn't the case without some prior activation.

Hmm, I'm stuck on how to introduce the ethoxy group. Maybe I should think of the target molecule and see if it's possible to install the nitro group last.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are introduced first, and then the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

So, steps:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated by another group. For example, introducing a nitro group first would activate certain positions, but nitro is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's usually for aryl halides.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable to benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification using a tosylate or similar, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced after activating the ring with a strong activating group, such as a methyl group. But then, after adding nitro, the ring would be deactivating, making further substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring is activated by another group.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first add the nitro group, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivating, making further substitution difficult.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about which options have the correct sequence of introducing these groups.

In the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and para to tert-butyl (position 2).

Wait, let me think about the possible steps again. Let's imagine the correct order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

So, benzene → ethoxy via something → tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → nitro via nitration.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after adding the tert-butyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of each option in terms of the steps needed.

Looking for an option where the ethoxy group is introduced after the ring has been activated by another group, perhaps via a substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a leaving group. So, perhaps the ring is first activated with a nitro group, then a leaving group is introduced, and then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is first activated with a strong activating group, then a leaving group is introduced, and then ethoxy is introduced via substitution.

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

But nitro is meta-directing and deactivating. So next substitution would be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts, but that isn't possible because ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method.

Wait, another idea: benzene can be converted to phenol via some method, and then the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. But that would require the phenol group to be converted into a good leaving group, like a tosylate, which then can be displaced by an ethoxide ion.

But in that case, the steps would be:

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene → reduction to phenyl amine → something else? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but that requires a palladium catalyst and a boronic acid, which may not be part of the given steps.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

The correct option must have steps that introduce the substituents in the correct positions.

Looking at option D:

Step i: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step iii: add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would be difficult. So, perhaps this is a problem. So, option D may not be correct.

Option B:

Step i: add tert-butyl.

Then, step ii: nitrate. So, where would the nitro group go? The tert-butyl is an activating group, so nitration would occur ortho or para to it.

Suppose the tert-butyl is at position 2. Then, nitration could be at position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl?), but wait, tert-butyl is an ortho/para director.

Wait, so if the tert-butyl is at position 2, nitration would occur at position 1 (ortho), 3 (meta), or 4 (para). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me imagine the structure: benzene with tert-butyl at position 2. After nitration, the nitro group would be ortho or para to the tert-butyl. So, it would be at position 1 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But the target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy at position 1.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the correct order.

Option C:

Step iii: after adding tert-butyl and sulfonating, nitrate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is to first add nitro, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro.

Wait, perhaps through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. So steps:

1. Nitro group added first: nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a leaving group (like a tosylate) at a position directed by the nitro group. Since nitro is meta-directing, the leaving group would be added meta to it.

3. Then, substitute the leaving group with ethoxy via SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution).

But I'm not sure if this is feasible, as the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a directing group that is then removed.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Add a group (like a sulfonic acid) in the meta position relative to nitro.

3. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

4. Then, add tert-butyl group in the ortho position relative to ethoxy.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts, then the nitro group in the meta position relative to tert-butyl, and then the ethoxy group in the ortho position relative to tert-butyl.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent directing effects:

If we have a benzene ring with substituents A, B, and C, each substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions.

In the target, substituents are at 1,2,3. So, perhaps the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

The ethoxy is an activating group, so when it's added first, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be added ortho or para to it. Let's say tert-butyl is at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy at 1). Then, nitration would occur meta to ethoxy, which would be position 3. So this would give the desired structure.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Add tert-butyl group (Friedel-Crafts) → ortho to ethoxy.

3. Nitrate → meta to ethoxy, which is position 3.

But the problem is step 1: how to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after activating the ring with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring is activated with a nitro group. But nitro is deactivating, making substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after adding a directing group that's then removed.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate → which would be meta to tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy group via some substitution.

But I'm not sure where the nitro and ethoxy would end up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro group.

But again, the issue is how to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated by another group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a nitro group → nitrobenzene.

2. Add a leaving group (like a tosylate) in the meta position relative to nitro.

3. Substitute the leaving group with ethoxy via SNAr.

4. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, which would be ortho or para to ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the feasibility of step 3 because the nitro group is deactivating, so the ring isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts etherification, but I'm not sure if that's a valid reaction. Friedel-Crafts is typically for alkylation and acylation, not for introducing ethers.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, which adds tert-butyl first, then nitro, which is in the para position relative to tert-butyl, then some other steps.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about each option again.

Option B's steps:

i: add tert-butyl.

ii: nitrate → nitro group at para to tert-butyl.

iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps a substitution.

iv: nitrate again → but target only has one nitro.

Hmm, perhaps option B is not correct.

Option D:

i: nitrate.

ii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine.

iii: add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

iv: nitrate → but target has only one nitro.

Hmm, not making sense.

Option C:

i: add tert-butyl.

ii: sulfonate.

iii: nitrate.

iv: Fe/HCl.

v: diazo.

vi: nitrate again.

Hmm, not making sense.

Option A:

i: add tert-butyl.

ii: nitrate.

iii: sulfonate.

iv: diazo.

v: H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vi: NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

vii: Fe/HCl.

viii: nitrate again.

ix: dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, multiple nitrations.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess. The target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl groups. The correct synthesis must involve adding nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl in the correct order, considering their directing effects.

The correct order is likely:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

3. Add tert-butyl group, which will be ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using an ethyl halide, but that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution where the leaving group is a nitro group, but that's not feasible.

Hmm, maybe the correct answer is option D.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → possibly reduce nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts might not work. So this step might not proceed.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But I don't know how to add ethoxy.

Another thought: Maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring is activated with a strong activating group, like a methyl group. But then, after adding nitro, the ring would be deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, like a Suzuki reaction, but that's not in the options.

Wait, I'm out of time and need to make a choice. Based on the options, the correct one is likely option D.

Wait, no, because option D starts with nitration, which may deactivate the ring for Friedel-Crafts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me think again.

Option B:

i) add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro group at meta to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → but target only has one nitro.

Hmm, not making sense.

Option C:

i) add tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.

iii) nitrate → nitro group would be ortho or para to sulfonic acid.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce sulfonic acid to a benzene ring, but not sure.

v) diazo.

vi) nitrate again → not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option A:

i) add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro at meta to tert-butyl.

iii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid.

iv) diazo.

v) hydrolysis.

vi) alkylation.

vii) Fe/HCl.

viii) nitrate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D.

But I'm really stuck. Based on the steps, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro and tert-butyl.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, which starts with nitration, then adds tert-butyl, but that's unlikely as nitro deactivates the ring.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time, and I have to make a decision. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). The synthesis must involve introducing these groups in an order that accounts for their directing effects and reactivity.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and alkylation, but the inclusion of sulfonation makes this option unlikely to yield the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Fe/HCl is unclear but might involve reduction or substitution.
   - Step iv: Another nitration step is unnecessary since the target molecule has only one nitro group.
   - This option appears to involve redundant steps and is unlikely to yield the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - Step iii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Subsequent steps include diazotization, hydrolysis, and alkylation, but the inclusion of sulfonation makes this option unlikely to yield the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step ii: Fe/HCl is unclear but might involve reduction or substitution.
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iv: Another nitration step is unnecessary since the target molecule has only one nitro group.
   - The nitro group being introduced first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) less feasible.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of the ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in a specific order to achieve the correct substitution pattern. However, none of the options fully align with the required sequence of reactions. Based on the analysis, **Option B** is the most plausible, as it introduces the tert-butyl and nitro groups in a logical order, even though it includes some unclear steps and redundant nitration.
