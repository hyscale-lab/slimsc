Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a corresponding butanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide (like NaCN), it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, wait. I think the reaction of ketones with CN- usually gives a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, right! The cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So the product would have both an -OH and a CN group attached to the same carbon as the original carbonyl.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group, which is the second carbon of butane. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons. Hmm, maybe the formula is CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, I think. Oh wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on a different position. Hmm, perhaps the initial structure is different.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count: butane is four carbons. So the structure is CH2CN-C(OH)(CH2CH3) or something else? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's more about the reaction conditions.

Wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So NaCN is providing the CN- nucleophile. The reaction is likely a nucleophilic addition to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the ketone is a poor electrophile, so you need to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic.

So the reagent A is probably an acid. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is just a strong acid, like from HCl or H2SO4. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, but can also act as a source of bisulfite ions, which can be nucleophiles in other reactions.

Wait, but in the formation of cyanohydrin, adding H+ is necessary to protonate the carbonyl oxygen. So the reaction would typically be carried out under acidic conditions. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. So the possible choices are options A, B.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The reagent is B, which is H2O. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, what's happening here? The nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical method is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat, or with a base. But wait, the reagent B is H2O, but what's the condition?

Wait, looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the conditions.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, using H2SO4 and H2O, heat, the nitrile converts to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, using something like NaOH and heat, you get a sodium salt, which can be acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

In this case, the starting material is a secondary alcohol (2-hydroxy) and a nitrile. The product is a secondary acid. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. The conditions for this reaction are typically either strong acid or strong base. In the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but what's the catalyst or acid/base?

Looking at the options, for B, the options are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So B is either HCl (a strong acid) or CH3COOH (a weak acid).

Wait, the problem says that the reagent is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So in that case, the nitrile would be hydrolyzed with H2O and H+ (from HCl, perhaps) to form the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, then the reaction is in a weak acid condition. But I'm more familiar with the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, or sometimes with HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction involves the oxidation of the nitrile. Wait, nitriles can also be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. Like with KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents. But the presence of H2O suggests a hydrolysis, not oxidation.

Wait, but the first reaction is about forming a cyanohydrin, which requires acid. So the second reaction uses B, which is either HCl or acetic acid. So for the second reaction, to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, perhaps HCl is the reagent. Because in the presence of H2O and HCl, the nitrile could undergo hydrolysis.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible mechanisms. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions typically involves adding water across the triple bond. The process is usually done in the presence of a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat, or sometimes using HCl as a catalyst.

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is either HCl (as a strong acid) or acetic acid (a weak acid). So if B is HCl (option A or C), then the reaction is acidic. If B is CH3COOH (option B or D), it's a weak acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is using a base. Wait, but the options don't include a base for B. So the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions.

Wait, another angle. The first reaction's reagent A is H3O+, which is from HCl, right? So if option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, then the second reagent is HCl. But how does that work for the hydrolysis?

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and in the options, B is H2O. Wait, no, wait: the question says, the second reaction is with reagent B (H2O). So B is the reagent, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me re-read. The question says:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

So the reagent is B, but what is B? The options list B as HCl or CH3COOH. So perhaps B is HCl, and the reaction is in H2O. Or maybe the reaction is done in HCl as the acid and H2O as the solvent.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reagents. Let me think again.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reaction is as follows: nitrile + H2O under acidic conditions (like HCl) to form carboxylic acid.

So in the reaction, the reagent B would be HCl, because the H2O is the solvent. So the reagent added is HCl, which provides the H+ and Cl- ions. So for B, the correct reagent is HCl.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → so both reactions would use H3O+ and then HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So if B is HCl, which is a strong acid, then option A would be correct.

Alternatively, let me think about the first reaction again. If A is H3O+, then the first reaction uses H3O+ as the catalyst. The second reaction requires HCl as the catalyst (B), because the nitrile hydrolysis is under acidic conditions. So which option pairs A and B as H3O+ and HCl? That's option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the other options. For example, option D says A is NaHSO3 and B is CH3COOH. So what would happen if A was NaHSO3?

NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm trying to remember: sodium bisulfite is a mild acid, but it's also a source of bisulfite ions. It's used as a reagent in some reactions, like the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, in the preparation of alcohols from ketones via the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, bisulfite can add to carbonyl groups in a different way.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN. If the reaction is under bisulfite conditions, perhaps the mechanism is different. Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin. The standard way to form a cyanohydrin is with an acid catalyst, like H3O+. So if A is NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, would that work? Or would it interfere?

Alternatively, perhaps the sodium bisulfite is acting as a different kind of catalyst. I'm not sure. I think the standard for cyanohydrin formation is H+ (like H3O+). So A is probably H3O+, which leaves options A and B.

So, for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then option A is correct.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, the hydrolysis can be done under different conditions. Let me consider the structure of the starting material in the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile.

So the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's a four-carbon chain (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile, and a benzylphenyl group attached as a substituent.

When this nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl group remains. So the product is a secondary alcohol and a carboxylic acid on the same carbon.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. Under what conditions is this hydrolysis done? If it's in acidic conditions, then HCl would be the catalyst.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ to protonate the ketone.

Second reaction: B is HCl as the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So the answer should be option A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion (CN⁻). Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary protons. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO₃) is less commonly used for this reaction and is not ideal here.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the compound 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. This hydrolysis typically occurs under acidic conditions, where H₂O acts as the solvent. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This pair is suitable for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not ideal for the first reaction, as it is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
