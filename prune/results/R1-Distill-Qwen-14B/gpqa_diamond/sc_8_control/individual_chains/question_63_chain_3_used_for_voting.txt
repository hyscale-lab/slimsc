Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, let me try to unpack what the question is asking.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The problem gives their masses: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. So I think this means the molecule isn't a rigid rotor but can vibrate as well. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized in terms of rotation, but since it's a non-rigid rotor, maybe the bond length can change, which affects the vibrational energy.

But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I'm a bit fuzzy on that term. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a given vibrational level. Or maybe it's the ground state of the vibrational and rotational levels? Hmm. Wait, no. For diatomic molecules, the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state (v=0), and the next state would be v=1. But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which I think refers to the first excited state.

Wait, but the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule absorbs a photon, which causes it to move to a higher energy state. But it's asking about the momentum of the photon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. A diatomic molecule's energy is a combination of translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. But in this model, I think we're considering just the rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right! The non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotational-vibrational coupling model) allows the bond length to vary, which couples the rotational and vibrational motions. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the energy levels compared to the rigid rotor model.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can model it using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations. Because the non-rigid rotor might complicate things, but maybe the problem is more straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are being treated as a combination of rotational and vibrational parts.

But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the photon must provide the energy difference between the initial and final states. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state (v=0, R=0?), but I'm not certain. Wait, the fundamental state for a vibrational mode is v=0. So if it's in the fundamental state, perhaps it's the ground vibrational state, but what about the rotational part?

Wait, the question refers to the "next state with the lowest possible energy". So from the current state, what's the next lowest state? That would be the first excited state. But in quantum mechanics, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So if the molecule is in the ground state of vibration (v=0) but maybe in the ground rotational state as well (J=0 or J=1, depending on the model), then the next state could involve either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which one is lower in energy?

Hmm, typically, vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational ones. For example, the ground vibrational state (v=0) has rotational energy levels starting from J=0 up. So the lowest energy transition would be a change in the rotational state. But wait, the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so maybe the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to the next allowed state. In that case, the next state could be J=1 or v=1.

Wait, but the question is about the photon causing the transition. So the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, what's the energy of the molecule in the fundamental state? The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, since the rotational energy increases with J.

Alternatively, if the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, the next state could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Which of these has a lower energy? The energy of the vibrational state is much higher than the rotational, so the transition to (v=1, J=0) might require a higher energy photon than (v=0, J=1). So the minimal photon energy would be the one for the rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so maybe it's the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state (J=1).

So the photon's energy would correspond to the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 in the rotational model.

Wait, but wait, the non-rigid rotor model couples rotational and vibrational energy. So perhaps the energy levels are not simply the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. But I'm not too familiar with that aspect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests the next energy level in the spectrum, which might involve a change in vibration or rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule being in the fundamental state here refers to the vibrational ground state, and the question is about the first rotational state, which would be the next higher energy.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure of the problem again. The options given are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is a very small momentum. Photons have momentum p = h / lambda, but also E = h f = p c, since for photons, E = pc.

So the momentum of the photon is related to its energy. So the question is about finding the energy difference between two states and then finding the photon's momentum.

So perhaps the energy difference is the first overtone or the fundamental in vibration, or the first rotational state.

Wait, the angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. That's in the visible range, since visible light is around 4e14 to 8e14 rad/s. So if the molecule is in its ground state, and the photon causes a transition to v=1, then the photon's frequency would be w, and the energy would be h w.

But wait, the rotational energy levels have their own spacing. The energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (h^2 / (2 I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So the spacing between J and J+1 is (h^2 / (2 I )) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] = (h^2 / (2 I )) (2J + 3). For J=0, the next state is J=1, so the energy difference is (h^2/(2I )) (3).

So the energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is 3 (h²)/(2I).

Alternatively, the energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is h w.

So which transition requires a smaller photon energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition has the lower energy: rotational or vibrational?

The vibrational transition has energy h w = h * 4e14 Hz. Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So E_vibrational = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

For the rotational transition, I need to compute I, the moment of inertia.

Moment of inertia I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) = (40) /22 = 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) e-27 ≈ approx 3.013e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.013e-27 *4e-20 = 1.205e-46 kg m².

So the rotational energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is (3 h²)/(2 I).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²s².

So (3 * 4.39e-67) / (2 * 1.205e-46) ) = (1.317e-66)/(2.41e-46) )= approx 5.46e-21 J.

Wait, that's about 5.46e-21 J for the rotational transition.

But the vibrational transition was about 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule would transition via the rotational path, requiring a photon with lower energy, which would correspond to a lower momentum.

Wait, but wait—the problem says that the molecule is in its fundamental state. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which includes both the vibrational and rotational ground states, then the next lowest energy state would be either the next rotational state or the first vibrational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the lower energy transition. So the photon would cause the rotational transition.

But wait, wait a second. The non-rigid rotor model may imply that the rotational and vibrational states are coupled, so a transition could involve a change in both. But I'm not too sure about that. But perhaps the question is just asking about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the first rotational state.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the rotational energy difference.

But wait, the options are all in units of momentum. So I need to compute the photon's momentum, which is p = E/c.

Because for a photon, E = pc. So if I find the energy difference, I can compute p.

So the rotational transition energy is about 5.46e-21 J.

So p = 5.46e-21 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1.82e-29 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are around 1e-29. The options are 1e-27, 1e-28, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me recalculate the rotational energy difference.

Compute I again:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) → 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ (1.81818 * 1.6605) = approx 3.013e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.013e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2052e-46 kg m².

The energy difference ΔE = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] * (h²/(2I)).

For J=0 → J=1, ΔE = [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * (h²/(2I)) ) → 2 * (h²/(2I)) ) → h²/(I).

So ΔE = (h²)/(I) → (6.626e-34)^2 / (1.2052e-46 kg m² )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J² s²).

Divide by I: 4.39e-67 / 1.2052e-46 = approx 3.64e-21 J.

So ΔE is approximately 3.64e-21 J. 

Then, p = ΔE / c → 3.64e-21 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.21e-29 kg m/s.

But wait, none of the options are that small. The options are in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the energy transition isn't rotational, but vibrational.

Wait, let me compute the vibrational energy.

Energy difference ΔE_vibrational = h * w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 Hz = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p = ΔE / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But this is about 8.8e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28. So that's in the ballpark, but not matching exactly. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

w = 4e14 rad/s → frequency f = w/(2π) → but wait, the energy is E = h * w, because E = h f and f = w/(2π), so E = h w/(2π). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no. The energy for a photon is E = h f, where f is the frequency in Hz. The angular frequency w is 2π f. So f = w/(2π). So E = h * (w/(2π)).

Wait, I think I messed that up earlier. So the correct energy is E = h w / (2π).

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The angular frequency w is 2π times the frequency f. So f = w/(2π). So h f = h w/(2π). So the energy is E = h w/(2π).

Ah! So earlier, I used E = h w, which is incorrect. Because w is in rad/s, but E = h f, where f is in Hz. So I have to use E = h*(w/(2π)).

So let me recalculate.

E_vibrational = h * (w/(2π)) = 6.626e-34 * (4e14)/(2π) 

Compute that: 4e14/(2π) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13.

So E = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.215e-20 J.

So the momentum p = E/c = 4.215e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.405e-28 kg·m/s, which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. So that's a match.

Wait, but why did I think earlier that the rotational transition requires less energy? Because in that case, I found the rotational transition would need about 3.64e-21 J, which is way larger than the vibrational transition's 4.215e-20 J. Wait, no, no: 3.64e-21 is smaller than 4.215e-20. So the rotational transition has a smaller energy, and so the photon's momentum would be smaller (since E is smaller, p = E/c is smaller).

But according to the calculation, the vibrational transition is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D, and the rotational would be about 1.2e-29 Ns, which isn't one of the options.

But the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational, meaning that the transition could involve a change in either. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels are actually a combination of rotation and vibration. So the energy is given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. But in a rigid rotor, E_rot is much smaller than E_vibr, but in a non-rigid rotor, perhaps they are closer.

But in the case of the fundamental state, perhaps the molecule is in the v=0, J=0 state. The next state would be the v=0, J=1 state, which is a rotational transition, or the v=1, J=0 state, which is a vibrational transition.

So which of those is lower in energy? The rotational transition would have a lower ΔE because E_rot is smaller than E_vibr.

But in my earlier calculation, the rotational ΔE is 3.64e-21 J, which is about 0.364% of 1e-19 J. The vibrational transition's ΔE is 4.2e-20 J, which is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

But wait, the vibrational transition is much bigger. So the rotational transition would require a photon with much smaller energy, meaning much smaller p. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that the next state is J=1.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the first allowed transition in vibration, not rotation. Because if the molecule is in the vibrational ground state, the next state would be v=1, which is a higher energy. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the vibrational state, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is combining both. Let me think again.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, then the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But which of these has a lower energy? The rotational energy for J=1 is higher than the vibrational energy for v=1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational ones. For example, a typical diatomic molecule's vibrational energy spacing is around 1e-19 J, whereas the rotational spacing is around 1e-20 J or lower. So the vibrational transition would require a higher energy photon than the rotational transition.

Wait, but in our calculations, the rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) was about 3.6e-21 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J). So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the J=1 state.

But then, according to that, the photon's momentum would be p = E/c = 3.64e-21 / 3e8 = 1.21e-29 Ns. But none of the options match that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

Wait, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE = [ (h²/(2I)) * (J=1's term - J=0's term) ]

J=0: E= (h²/(2I)) * 0*(0+1) = 0.

J=1: E= (h²/(2I)) * 1*(2) )= (2 h²)/(2I) )= h²/(I).

So ΔE = h²/(I).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.2052e-46 kg m².

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

h²/(I) = 4.39e-67 / 1.205e-46 ≈ 3.64e-21 J.

So that's correct. So the photon's energy would be 3.64e-21 J, which gives p = 1.21e-29 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the energy level for the vibrational transition. Let's compute that again, but this time correctly.

E = h * w/(2π) = 6.626e-34 *4e14/(2π) ≈ (6.626e-34 *4e14) /6.283 ≈ (2.65e-19) /6.283 ≈ 4.215e-20 J.

p = E / c = 4.215e-20 /3e8 = 1.405e-28 kg m/s, which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

But why would the next state be a vibrational one, when the rotational transition has a lower energy?

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration, so the overall energy is lower in the vibrational state than in the rotational state. Hmm, but that would depend on the specific model.

Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state refers to the ground state of vibration (v=0), but the rotational state can be higher. So the next state would be v=0, J=1, but if that's the case, the photon's momentum would be 1.2e-29 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for the rotational energy is wrong because in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia isn't fixed. But the problem gives R as 2 angstroms. So maybe I'm supposed to calculate the moment of inertia using that R, but perhaps it's an average or equilibrium bond length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a rigid rotor, and the transition is vibrational. But why?

Wait, the options have D as 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition. But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition would require a much smaller photon momentum. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the question is referring to the energy transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1), which requires a photon of energy h w.

Wait a minute, the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is, I think, the ground state (v=0), and the next state would be the first vibrational state (v=1). So the photon would cause a transition from v=0 to v=1, which would require energy h w/(2π), which gives us the momentum as 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why then is the rotational transition not considered? Because the rotational transition would require a photon with a much smaller momentum, but perhaps it's not an allowed transition. Wait, but in reality, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational transitions as well, due to the selection rules. But in a rigid rotor model, the rotational selection rule is ΔJ = ±1.

But if the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, then the next state could be v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that's the one with the lower energy.

Wait, but if the rotational transition (v=0, J=1) has lower energy than the vibrational (v=1, J=0), then the photon's momentum should be based on the rotational transition. But the problem is that our calculation for that gives a momentum not among the options. So perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the energy levels, and the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the energy of the photon causing a transition to the next vibrational state, and the rotational state is neglected. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recalculate.

I = μ R² = ( (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 20 * 2 =40, 40/22≈1.818 amu. So μ =1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so 1.818 *1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I = 3.01e-27 * (4e-20) = 1.204e-46 kg m².

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

ΔE = h² / I = 4.39e-67 /1.204e-46 ≈ 3.646e-21 J.

p = E/c = 3.646e-21 /3e8 = 1.215e-29 kg m/s ≈ 1.2e-29 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that. The options are 1e-27, 1e-28, etc. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption about the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational energy but the vibrational energy. So the photon's energy is h w, but wait, no, earlier correction: E = h w/(2π).

Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h w/(2π) = (6.626e-34)(4e14) / (2 *3.1416) ≈ (2.65e-19) /6.283 ≈ 4.215e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.215e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.405e-28 kg·m/s → approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps despite the rotational transition requiring less energy, the problem is considering the vibrational transition, which requires a photon with momentum 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem as follows:

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). The fundamental state corresponds to the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) and the ground rotational state ($J=0$). The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either the first rotational state ($J=1$) or the first vibrational state ($v=1$). The energy difference for these transitions determines which requires a smaller photon energy.

### Rotational Transition ($J=0 \to J=1$)
The rotational energy levels are given by:

\[
E_J = \frac{h^2}{2I} J(J+1),
\]

where $I = \mu R^2$ is the moment of inertia, $\mu$ is the reduced mass, and $R$ is the bond length. The reduced mass $\mu$ is calculated as:

\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu})(2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]

Converting $\mu$ to kilograms ($1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$):

\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.013 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The bond length $R$ is given as $2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}$. Thus, the moment of inertia is:

\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.013 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.205 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

The energy difference for the rotational transition ($J=0 \to J=1$) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{I} \left[(J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1)\right].
\]

For $J=0 \to J=1$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{I}.
\]

Substituting $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$ and $I = 1.205 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2$:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.205 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 3.64 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}.
\]

The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by $p = \frac{E}{c}$, where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$. Thus:

\[
p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{3.64 \times 10^{-21}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.21 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

### Vibrational Transition ($v=0 \to v=1$)
The vibrational energy levels are modeled as a harmonic oscillator, with the energy difference between states given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega,
\]

where $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}$. Substituting $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

The momentum of the photon is:

\[
p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

### Conclusion
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, resulting in a much smaller photon momentum ($p_{\text{rot}} \approx 1.21 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{Ns}$). However, none of the provided options match this value. The vibrational transition, on the other hand, corresponds to a momentum of approximately $1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}$, which matches option D. Given the options provided, the problem likely assumes the vibrational transition is being considered.

**Answer: D**
