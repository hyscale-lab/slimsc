Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what C3h symmetry means.

Wait, symmetry in molecules... right. C3h is a type of point group. Point groups are used in molecular symmetry to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements. So, C3h symmetry includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Oh, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. C3h is a combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane that passes through the center of the molecule.

Now, looking at the options given:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
Option C: triisopropyl borate
Option D: quinuclidine

I need to check each molecule for C3h symmetry.

Starting with Option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is at the center, bonded to three isopropyl groups. Boron is trigonal planar. Each isopropyl group is symmetrical. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. Wait, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

If you look from above, the molecule is symmetric in three directions. So, the three isopropyl groups are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. That would mean a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm thinking that each isopropyl group is identical, so the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. I think the symmetry is D3h. Because D3h has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but wait, the question is about C3h. Oh, C3h might be a lower symmetry than D3h. Or wait, no, maybe the point group is D3h if it has more symmetry elements.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any object on one side of the mirror plane is mirrored on the other. So, for triisopropyl borate, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar (like trigonal planar), then the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (like the plane containing the central atom and the middle of each substituent) would be a mirror plane. But wait, is that a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. So, if the molecule is in a horizontal plane, the mirror would be vertical, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is the one that's perpendicular to the C3 axis, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry. Because D3h includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but then if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, then the point group would be D3h. But the question is about C3h, which is a lower symmetry. So perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a C3h symmetry but a higher symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options as well.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. Its structure is like a norbornane but with a pyrrolidine ring. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three substituents around a central bridgehead. No, wait, maybe it's more like a seven-membered ring with three bridges. Wait, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe it's got a different symmetry. I'm not too sure about quinuclidine's symmetry. Maybe it's a tricyclic molecule with a three-membered ring.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the triphenylene-derived structures in options A and B. They are trifuran derivatives with various substituents. Benzo and triphenylene are fused ring systems.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

So, benzo has a benzene ring fused to three furan rings, perhaps in a way that creates a symmetrical structure. Similarly, triphenylene is a tricyclic system.

Wait, but I'm not sure about their exact structures. Maybe I should think about the number of substituents and their arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of symmetry axes. For C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, maybe the molecule with three identical substituents arranged around a central point would have C3 symmetry. If it also has a mirror plane, then perhaps C3h.

Looking back at the options, triisopropyl borate (option C) has three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Each isopropyl is the same, so it's symmetric. So, the central B is at the center, and each substituent is identical.

In such a case, the molecule should have a C3 axis (rotating 120 degrees brings the molecule onto itself). Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, for example, in the plane of the boron and the three substituents, but that's not a horizontal plane. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what's considered horizontal in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is a vertical plane that bisects the molecule. But I'm not certain. If the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry than C3h. Let me think about the point groups again. The D3h group includes a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and other symmetry elements. So if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane, its point group would be D3h, not C3h.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up point groups. The C3h point group has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But if a molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would belong to the D3h group because D3h includes the combination of C3, σh, and other elements. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, it's D3h, not C3h.

Hmm, so maybe none of the molecules have C3h. But that can't be, because the question states one of them does.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether any of the molecules have only a C3 axis and no other symmetry planes or axes beyond that.

Wait, if a molecule has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane, then its point group is C3. But C3h is a different point group which includes a σh plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a σh plane but not a C3 axis, but that doesn't make sense as C3h requires both.

Wait, maybe I should think about each molecule's structure more carefully.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a tricyclic system. So, the structure would have three benzene rings connected in a linear fashion. The trifuran part would add three oxygen atoms in a furan arrangement. The substituents are in certain positions.

But I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Benzo fused with three furans. Maybe the arrangement is such that there's a three-fold symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, but lacks a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these molecules are known for having C3h symmetry.

Wait, I remember that triisopropyl borane has a trigonal planar structure with a three-fold axis. But what about the mirror plane? Triisopropyl borate might have a plane of symmetry, making it have higher symmetry than C3h.

Alternatively, quinuclidine is a molecule I'm more familiar with. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, and I think it's a tricyclic molecule with a three-membered ring. I'm not sure about its symmetry. Maybe I should try to visualize it.

Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system with two bridgeheads and a seven-membered ring. Wait, actually, quinuclidine has a structure where it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative, but with an additional ring. Or is it a bicyclo with a seven-membered ring? Maybe that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Let me think: if it's a seven-membered ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule with a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, another approach: think about the chair-like structures. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, as it's a known molecule with trigonal symmetry.

Wait, but if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it doesn't have C3h. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine. Wait, quinuclidine is a molecule with a three-membered ring, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, another angle: in the case of C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps the molecule is asymmetrical in certain ways but symmetric in others.

Maybe the triphenyleno... structure has three arms, each connected to the central part. So, maybe the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the name suggests a triphenylene core, which is a symmetric structure with three benzene rings arranged in a row. If the substituents are attached in a symmetrical fashion, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis.

Wait, triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule. It has three benzene rings connected in a linear fashion, each adjacent pair sharing a common side. So, it's symmetric along the axis that runs through the middle of the structure. So, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis. Then, if the trifuran substituents are placed symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in option A are arranged such that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, thus giving it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, benzo... in option B might have a three-fold arrangement because of the way it's fused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think about each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: three isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. Each isopropyl is (CH(CH2CH3)2). The molecule is trigonal planar, so yes, a C3 axis. Also, each substituent is identical, so it must have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the point group would be D3h, not C3h. So if the question is about C3h, then it's not the correct answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. I think it has a three-membered bridge. Let me imagine the structure: it's a seven-membered ring with three bridges, each between adjacent carbons. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, no, because the bridge is three carbons, but the arrangement might not allow a horizontal mirror plane. Maybe the structure is such that it has a three-fold axis but lacks a mirror plane. So perhaps its point group is C3.

But the question is about C3h. So if it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's structure doesn't have a mirror plane, so it's C3.

If that's the case, then the correct molecule would be the one that has both C3 and σh.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the other options again.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is symmetric with three benzene rings. Then, the trifuran part adds three oxygen atoms in certain positions. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has a C3h symmetry.

Wait, maybe the substituents on the trifuran are positioned in such a way that the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, other way around: if a molecule has a C3h symmetry, then it must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, perhaps the molecule in option A has these.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because triisopropyl borate has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane. No, wait, I thought earlier it has a mirror plane, making it D3h.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the point groups. C3h has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if a molecule has both, it's C3h. If it has more symmetry elements, like additional mirror planes or C2 axes, then it's a higher point group, like D3h.

So, maybe the correct answer is option A, which has a structure that, due to the arrangement of the substituents, has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no higher symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, but I'm no longer certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for resources or examples. I remember that D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h. So if a molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, plus other symmetry elements, it's D3h. So if a molecule falls into C3h, it must have the three-fold axis and the horizontal mirror plane but no other symmetry elements beyond that.

So, which of the options fits that?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has three identical substituents around a central atom. So, it's likely to have a C3 axis and a D3h symmetry because of the presence of C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Thus, the point group would be D3h, not C3h.

So the correct answer is not option C.

Looking again, perhaps option A has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane but no other symmetry elements. So, it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe option A is a tricyclic structure with three arms, each identical, leading to a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, which has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. Wait, but earlier I thought it's D3h because of more symmetry elements.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think: for D3h, the molecule would have a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and also three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, triisopropyl borate does have three C2 axes (each through the boron and the center of each isopropyl substituent). Thus, it has D3h symmetry, not C3h.

So, triisopropyl borate wouldn't have C3h but D3h. So it's not the correct answer.

Hmm, that leaves me with the other options. So, which of the remaining options has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other symmetry elements.

Option D: quinuclidine. If it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other symmetry, then it would be C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but doesn't have a mirror plane, so its point group is C3.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane implies that the molecule is symmetrical when reflected across that plane. So, for example, if the molecule is symmetrical top to bottom across a plane, that would be a horizontal plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, but the question is about a horizontal plane.

Wait, the term 'horizontal mirror plane' refers to a plane that's perpendicular to the main axis (like the C3 axis), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, but I can't be certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps looking for the number of rings and symmetry.

Option B is benzo-based, which typically has a two-fold symmetry, but perhaps in this structure, it's arranged to have three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options fit, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the hexaone part. The hexaone suggests that there are six ketone groups, but that's probably a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the structures in options A and B are similar to adamantane derivatives, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Perhaps I should go with the most likely option based on my current knowledge.

Wait, triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which is more than C3h. So it's not the answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a point group of C3. Because it has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes. So if it had a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h. But I'm not sure if it has a mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane that bisects the molecule along one bridge, making it symmetrical. If so, then it would have a σ plane, perhaps a horizontal one.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, making it C3, but not necessarily C3h.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, triphenyleno... because the triphenylene part has three benzene rings arranged in a row, which would give it a three-fold axis. And if the trifuran substituents are placed symmetrically, the molecule could have a horizontal mirror plane.

Thus, the point group would be C3h.

Alternatively, maybe that's the case.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h symmetry** requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- The molecule is based on a triphenylene core, which consists of three benzene rings arranged symmetrically in a linear fashion. This arrangement provides a **C₃ axis** due to the three-fold rotational symmetry.
- The trifuran substituents are positioned symmetrically on the triphenylene core, which suggests the presence of a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.
- The molecule likely has **C₃h symmetry** as it satisfies both the C₃ axis and σh plane requirements.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is based on a benzo-fused trifuran system. While the structure may have some symmetry, the arrangement of substituents does not clearly indicate a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
- The symmetry elements required for **C₃h symmetry** are not definitively present in this structure.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. This arrangement provides a **C₃ axis** due to the three-fold rotational symmetry.
- The molecule also has a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**, as the plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis bisects the molecule.
- However, the molecule has additional symmetry elements (e.g., three C₂ axes), which elevate its symmetry to **D₃h**, not **C₃h**.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. It has a **C₃ axis** due to the three-fold rotational symmetry of the bridge.
- However, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as the arrangement of substituents does not satisfy this requirement.
- Therefore, quinuclidine does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) is the only molecule that satisfies the requirements for **C₃h symmetry**, as it has both a C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
