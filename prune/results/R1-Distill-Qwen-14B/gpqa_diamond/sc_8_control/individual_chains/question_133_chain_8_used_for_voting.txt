Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH, so I need to consider how these salts dissociate and what species they produce.

First, the setup: the solution's volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There's 1.00 g of each salt. So I think I need to find the moles of each salt first.

The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate the moles for each.

For KH2PO4: moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: same thing, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Wait, but what are these salts dissociating into? I think I should break them down.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, I think it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. Or wait, actually, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it's Na2HPO4 plus 2 H2O. But in solution, the HPO4^2- comes from that. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- from the first salt and HPO4^2- from the second. Now, how do these relate to orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-)?

I remember that phosphate exists in different protonated forms. The various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The salts here are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which I think is PO4^3-. So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in solution.

Wait, but maybe not. Because orthophosphate is H3PO4, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

So, how do H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- contribute to PO4^3-?

I think phosphate can undergo hydrolysis. So H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. But in solution, the pH will depend on the buffer system created by these salts.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So this is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Wait, the pKa for which step? Because H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first is H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1 = 7.5e-3, pKa1 ≈ 2.12). The second is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 ≈ 7.21). The third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3 = 1.8e-12, pKa3 ≈ 11.74).

Since we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the relevant pKa would be the second one, pKa2 = 7.21.

So, in the solution, the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] will determine the pH.

Calculating the concentrations:

Total volume is 0.2 L. Moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007335 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005614 mol.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M

So, plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

= 7.21 + log(0.02807 / 0.036675)

Let me compute that ratio: 0.02807 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7656.

Log(0.7656) is approximately log(0.75) is around -0.1249, but let me calculate more accurately.

Log(0.7656) ≈ using calculator steps:

0.7656 → log(7.656e-1). Let me think, log(7) is 0.845, log(7.656) is about 0.885. Since it's 0.7656, which is 7.656e-1, so log is log(7.656) -1 → 0.885 - 1 = -0.115.

Wait, but more accurately, using a calculator-like approach:

Let me compute log(0.7656):

We know that log(0.7) ≈ -0.1549, log(0.8)= -0.09691.

0.7656 is closer to 0.77. Let's see, 0.77: log(77)=1.886, so 1.886 -2= -0.114.

Alternatively, using exact calculation:

log(0.7656) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.21 -0.114 ≈ 7.096.

So the solution is at pH ≈7.1.

Now, knowing the pH, I can determine the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because in solution, phosphate can be in H3PO4 (protonated), H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-.

But wait, how does pH relate to the distribution of these species?

The phosphate species distribution depends on pH. At pH around 7, which is close to pKa2 (7.21), the predominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

So, to find [PO4^3-], I can use the third dissociation constant, Ka3.

Ka3 is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

But wait, the solution's pH is around 7.1. Since pKa3 is 11.74, this is way higher than the solution's pH. So, the third dissociation is not significant here. Because at pH much lower than pKa3, the equilibrium lies towards the acid form, meaning HPO4^2- is not dissociating into PO4^3- much.

Wait, wait, that's correct. Because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), which means that the third dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very low.

But perhaps the solution is to calculate the concentration based on the third dissociation, considering the pH.

So, the formula for [PO4^3-] would involve the third dissociation.

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So, rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M. [H+] is 10^-pH, which is 10^-7.1.

Wait, let's compute [H+]. pH=7.1 → [H+] = 7.94e-8 M.

So plug in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (7.94e-8) 

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8: 5.0526e-14 /7.94e-8 ≈ 6.366e-7.

Wait that's about 6.366e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but wait another thing: The solution is containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is around 7.1. So the concentration of H+ is about 7.94e-8.

So Ka3 is 1.8e-12 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

Wait, rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

So plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M

[H+] = 7.94e-8

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (7.94e-8) = (5.0526e-14) / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.366e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.37e-7 M, which is close to option A's 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere. Let's check again.

Wait, perhaps the pH I calculated is incorrect? Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch was pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). Wait, [base] is HPO4^2-, and [acid] is H2PO4^-.

So, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02807 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7656.

log(0.7656) ≈ -0.114 → pH=7.21 -0.114 = 7.096, which is approximately 7.1, so [H+] is 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8.

Wait, but another approach: maybe I should consider that the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- affects the pH, but maybe I can also account for the autoionization of water or other factors. Hmm, but I think the Henderson-Hasselbalch approximation is valid here since it's a buffer solution.

Wait, but wait a second: The two salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when they dissociate, the solution also contains K+ and Na+ ions, which are spectator ions. So the main species affecting pH are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So I think the calculation is correct, so [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.37e-7 M. But the options don't have exactly that number. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact [H+] more accurately. Let me re-calculate it.

The pH is 7.096, so [H+] = 10^-7.096.

10^-7 is 1e-7. Let's compute 10^0.096 → 10^0.096 ≈ 1.245 (since 10^0.1≈1.258, so 0.096 is a bit less). So 10^-7.096 ≈ 1.245e-7 ≈ 1.245e-7 M.

Wait, that's different from what I computed earlier (7.94e-8). Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier [H+] calculation. Let me compute 10^-7.096 correctly.

So 7.096 is 7 + 0.096.

10^7 is 1e7, so 10^-7 is 1e-7.

10^0.096 is approximately: since log(1.245)=0.0959, so 1.245. So 10^0.096 ≈ 1.245.

So [H+] = 1e-7 / 1.245 ≈ 8.03e-8. Wait, no, wait: 10^-7.096 = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.096) = (1e-7) * (1/1.245) ≈ 8.03e-8.

Wait no, wait: 10^(-7.096) = 10^(-7 -0.096) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.096) = 1e-7 * (approx 0.803). So [H+] ≈ 8.03e-8 M.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Hmm, I think I confused the exponent signs.

Wait, [H+] = 10^-7.096 ≈ 8.03e-8. So redo the calculation.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.03e-8) 

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0526e-14 / 8.03e-8 = approx 6.295e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.295e-7 M. Which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. So that makes sense.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = ?

1.8 * 0.02807 = 0.050526 → 0.050526e-12 → 5.0526e-14.

Divided by 8.03e-8: 5.0526e-14 /8.03e-8 = (5.0526 /8.03) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.03 ≈ 0.6295.

So 0.6295e-6 = 6.295e-7 M.

So approximately 6.295e-7 M, which is why option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But perhaps the exact calculation would be a little different.

Wait, but let me think: the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is 0.02807 /0.036675.

Compute that accurately:

0.02807 / 0.036675 = ?

Well, 0.02807 /0.036675 ≈ 0.7656. Let me compute log(0.7656) more precisely.

Using log(0.7656):

We can use the Taylor series or a calculator method.

But perhaps using exact values, log(0.7656) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.21 -0.114 =7.096.

Wait, but perhaps I can use more precise calculation for log(0.7656):

log(7.656e-1) → log(7.656) -1.

log(7) is 0.8451, log(7.656)=?

We can compute log(7.656) as follows.

Between 7 and 8, log(7)=0.8451, log(8)=0.9031.

7.656 is 65.6% from 7 to 8.

Compute using linear approximation:

log(7) = 0.8451, log(8)=0.9031.

Difference between 7 and 8 is 1 in x, log increases by 0.058.

So for x=7.656, which is 0.656 above 7, the increase in log would be 0.656 * 0.058 ≈ 0.038.

So log(7.656) ≈ 0.8451 + 0.038 ≈ 0.8831.

So log(0.7656) = log(7.656) -1 ≈ 0.8831 -1 = -0.1169.

So pH =7.21 + (-0.1169) =7.0931.

So [H+]=10^-7.0931 ≈ 8.05e-8.

Wait, 10^(-7.0931) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0931)

10^(-0.0931) is approximately 0.804, because log(0.804)=approx -0.093.

So [H+] ≈8.04e-8 M.

So plug back into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.04e-8) 

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02807 =5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.04e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.04e-8 = (5.0526/8.04) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.04 ≈0.6285.

So 0.6285e-6 → 6.285e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.28e-7 M. So the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

But wait, another consideration: Are there any other sources of PO4^3- aside from the dissociation of HPO4^2-?

No, because the other species is H2PO4^-, which can only lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

So the only source is from the third dissociation, which is minimal due to the low pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So the calculation seems correct.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of all phosphate species, but the question specifically asks for PO4^3-.

So the answer should be approximately 6.28e-7 M, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7.

But wait, the options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

Hmm, but wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of moles. Let me double-check the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. So 1/136.1 ≈0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Yes, that seems correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should account for the fact that when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it contributes 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. But the water doesn't contribute to the ionic charge, so it's fine.

Wait, but wait another thought: The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but perhaps the pH is such that some of the HPO4^2- is further deprotonated to PO4^3-.

But since the pH is around 7.1, which is below pKa3 (11.74), the third deprotonation is minimal. So the concentration of PO4^3- is indeed very low, as we calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, but the problem is to find it.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should be to consider that the solution is prepared with these two salts, so the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and under the given pH, some HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but another thing: the initial assumption was that the solution volume is 0.2 L, but perhaps the total number of moles of phosphate is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So, the total moles of phosphate species are:

H2PO4^-: 0.007335 mol,

HPO4^2-:0.005614 mol.

Total phosphate: 0.012949 mol.

But the point is, each of these can contribute to PO4^3-.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the charge balance. Let me think: the solution must be electrically neutral.

The cations in solution are K+ and Na+.

Moles of K+ from KH2PO4: 0.007335 mol.

Moles of Na+ from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005614 mol * 2 = 0.011228 mol.

Total cations: 0.007335 +0.011228=0.018563 mol.

Anions are H2PO4^- (0.007335 mol), HPO4^2- (0.005614 mol), and any PO4^3- (let's call it x).

Each HPO4^2- contributes 2- charge, H2PO4^- is 1-, and PO4^3- is 3-.

Wait, the total negative charge must equal the total positive charge.

So:

Total negative charge = (0.007335 * 1) + (0.005614 * 2) + (x *3) = ?

Wait, no. Wait, H2PO4^- is 1-, HPO4^2- is 2-, PO4^3- is 3-.

So the negative charge is:

(0.007335 * 1) + (0.005614 * 2) + (x *3) = 0.007335 + 0.011228 +3x = 0.018563 +3x.

The positive charge is 0.018563 mol (from K+ and Na+).

So to balance:

0.018563 +3x = 0.018563 → 3x=0 → x=0.

Wait, that can't be right because we have PO4^3- in solution. Did I make a mistake in the charge calculation?

Wait, wait. The salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So, the anions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The cations are K+ and Na+.

The total cations: 1 per KH2PO4 and 2 per Na2HPO4·2H2O.

So moles of K+: 0.007335.

Moles of Na+: 0.005614 * 2 =0.011228.

Total cations: 0.018563.

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.007335), HPO4^2- (0.005614), and any PO4^3- (x).

Each HPO4^2- contributes 2-; each H2PO4^- contributes 1-; each PO4^3- contributes 3-.

Total negative charge: (0.007335 *1) + (0.005614 *2) + (x *3) = 0.007335 +0.011228 +3x = 0.018563 +3x.

Total positive charge: 0.018563.

So for charge balance:

0.018563 +3x =0.018563 →3x=0 →x=0.

Hmm, that suggests that [PO4^3-]=0, which is not possible because we know that HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-.

So perhaps the charge balance approach is more accurate than the earlier method.

Wait, but how can that be? Because if the solution must be neutral, then the total negative charge must equal the total positive.

So 0.018563 +3x =0.018563 → x=0. But that can't be correct because in reality, some HPO4^2- does dissociate into PO4^3-.

Ah, perhaps the assumption that the solution is neutral is incorrect, but that's not possible because all the ions must balance.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge calculation.

Wait, the negative charge comes from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Each H2PO4^- is 1-, each HPO4^2- is 2-, and each PO4^3- is 3-.

So the total negative charge is:

(0.007335 *1) + (0.005614 *2) + (x *3) =0.007335 +0.011228 +3x = 0.018563 +3x.

The positive charge is from K+ and Na+:

0.007335 (from K+) + 0.011228 (from Na+) =0.018563.

So:

0.018563 +3x =0.018563 → 3x=0 →x=0.

This suggests that x=0, which can't be correct because our earlier calculation found x≈6.3e-7 M.

So how is this possible? There must be a mistake in the assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't neutral because the phosphate species and others contribute to the charge. Wait, no, all ions must balance.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-, it produces H+ as well. So the H+ ions are part of the positive charge.

Ah, that's the key point I was missing. Because when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces H+ and PO4^3-. So the H+ contributes to the positive charge.

So, the correct charge balance equation includes the H+ concentration.

So, the total positive charge is: [K+] + 2[Na+] + [H+] = 0.007335 + 2*(0.005614) + [H+].

Wait, no, wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 2 Na+ per formula unit, and KH2PO4 gives 1 K+.

So, K+ is 0.007335 mol, Na+ is 0.011228 mol.

The H+ comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the exact charge balance should be:

[K+] + 2[Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]

But in this case, [OH^-] is negligible because pH is around 7.1, so it's close to neutral but not exactly neutral.

But this complicates things because now the charge balance includes H+ and OH^-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to ignore OH^- at pH 7.1, so:

[K+] + 2[Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] +3[PO4^3-]

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the initial approach using Ka3 was sufficient.

But then why does the charge balance approach suggest x=0?

Because the charge balance equation, without considering H+, gives x=0.

This suggests that without the H+ contribution, the only solution is x=0. But when H+ is considered, x can be non-zero.

So, perhaps the correct approach includes both the pH and the charge balance.

But this is getting very complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of the problem.

Given the time I have, I think the initial approach is sufficient, leading to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²). The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Dissociation of salts
- KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, contributing 0.007335 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.
- Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻, contributing 0.005614 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 3: Buffer system and pH calculation
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]
Here, pKa₂ = 7.21, \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = 0.02807 \, \text{M}\), and \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = 0.036675 \, \text{M}\). The ratio is:
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.036675} \approx 0.7656
\]
\[
\log(0.7656) \approx -0.114
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.114 \approx 7.096
\]
The hydrogen ion concentration is:
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is governed by:
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.04 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807) = 5.0526 \times 10^{-14}
\]
Then divide by the denominator:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.04 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.285 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.285 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
