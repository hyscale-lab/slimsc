Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ). Wait, but wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Another formula I recall is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk)(cos α) - (hl)(cos β) - (kl)(cos γ) ) but no, maybe that's not exactly right. Or perhaps it's the reciprocal: 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) etc. Oh, wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral structure is derived from the unit cell parameters.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, the lattice is rhombohedral, so a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is given by the reciprocal formula: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos α)/(a²) - (2 hl cos β)/(a²) - (2 kl cos γ)/(a²).

Wait, but since all the angles are the same (30 degrees) and all a, b, c are equal, the formula should simplify. Let me see.

So substituting a = b = c = a, α=β=γ=θ=30 degrees, and the Miller indices (hkl) as (1,1,1).

Then, let's compute 1/d²:

1/d² = [ (1² + 1² + 1²) ] /a² - [ 2*(1*1)*cosθ ]/a² - [ 2*(1*1)*cosθ ]/a² - [ 2*(1*1)*cosθ ]/a².

Wait, because when a = b = c and angles are α = β = γ, the terms would be:

But wait, the formula for 1/d² is:

( h² + k² + l² )/(a²) - ( hk (cos α + cos β + cos γ) )/(a²) ?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. I think the general formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² * [ 1/(1 - 2 cos α) ] ? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, wait. Another approach: The interplanar distance for a cubic system (where angles are 90 degrees) is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But for non-cubic systems, we have to adjust for the angles.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and angles α, α, α. The formula I think is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, because in a cubic system, cos α is zero (since angles are 90 degrees), so the middle terms disappear, and it reduces to the standard formula. That makes sense.

So plugging in the numbers:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt(1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30)).

Wait, wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

Then, the terms with cosα: 2hk cosα is 2*1*1*cos30, same for the other terms. So since all the a's, b's, c's are equal, and all angles are 30 degrees, all the cross terms are 2 cos30.

Wait, but how many terms are there? Let me recount.

In the general formula for rhombohedral, is it:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, it becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos30 - 2hl cos30 - 2kl cos30 )

So for (111), that's:

Denominator = sqrt( 3 - 2*(cos30)*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) )

Because 2hk + 2hl + 2kl = 2*(1 + 1 +1 ) for (111), since hk, hl, kl are each 1.

Wait, no. Because 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30. So each term is 2 cos30 times the product hk, etc.

But for (111), each product is 1. So each term is 2 cos30*1.

So the sum in the denominator is 3 - 2 * cos30 * (1 + 1 + 1) ?

Wait, no. Let me re-express.

Denominator = sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ )

But since α=β=γ=30°, let's substitute:

Denominator = sqrt( 3 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, because 2*cos30 is added three times: 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 = 2(cos30) * (hk + hl + kl) = 2 cos30 (1 +1 +1) )= 6 cos30.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Compute that: cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * sqrt(3)/2 = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So denominator sqrt(3 - 5.196) = sqrt(-2.196) ?

Wait, that's impossible. Oh wait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be correct because the square root of a negative number isn't real. So I must have messed up the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I missed the sign in the formula. Maybe it's (h² +k² + l²) and then subtract 2hk cos α, etc. But if the sum is more than the sum, we get a negative. Which can't be.

Wait, but in rhombohedral systems, the angles are all 60 degrees, or is it 30? Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the structure.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell can have a certain angle, but perhaps for this calculation, the cosines might result in a positive denominator.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the denominator correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Denominator = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosα - 2kl cosα )

Since all angles are the same, so it's:

sqrt(3 - 2 cos30 (1 +1 +1) )

Which would be sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, but as I calculated earlier, that gives a negative number. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal can be written as:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / a² - ( 2 hk cos α )/(a²) - ( 2 hl cos β )/(a²) - ( 2 kl cos γ )/(a² )

But in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

1/d² = (3)/(a²) - (2 * 1 * 1 * cos30 )/(a²) * (3 times, because hk, hl, kl are each 1)

Wait, no, the terms are 2hk cosα, 2hl cosβ, 2kl cosγ. Since all are 30, each term is 2 cos30.

So:

1/d² = [3 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α ] / a²

Wait, but hk + hl + kl = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

So,

1/d² = (3 - 2 * 3 * cos30 ) / (a²)

Compute the numerator: 3 -6 cos30.

As before, that's 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196= -2.196.

So 1/d² = (-2.196)/(a²), which is negative. But 1/d² can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But in our case, for (111), and α=β=γ=30°, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 - 6 cos30.

Again, same problem as before.

Hmm, but that can't be right. So maybe the formula is different. Wait, perhaps in rhombohedral, the angle is different. Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the angles α, β, γ are not the angles between the edges in the same way as in a cubic system. Wait, perhaps in the formula, the angles are the angles between the edges for each pair. So for a rhombohedron, the angle between a and b, a and c, and b and c are all the same, which is 30 degrees.

But when I plug in, I end up with a negative inside the square root. That can't be possible. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices (hkl) and the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / a² * (1) ... but no, that's for cubic systems.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / (a²) - (2 hk cos α)/(a²) - (2 hl cos β)/(a²) - (2 kl cos γ)/(a²).

But with the angles all 30 degrees, this becomes:

1/d² = (3)/(a²) - (2 *1*1 cos30 + 2 *1*1 cos30 + 2 *1*1 cos30) / a².

Which is (3 - 6 cos30 ) / a².

Wait, same as before, which is negative. Hmm. That's a problem.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is positive, so perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should double-check the formula.

Another approach: Maybe the formula is written differently. I think the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, but that would mean that for (111), it's:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 cos30 (1 + 1 +1 ) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

But 6 cos30 is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 is negative, leading to sqrt of a negative number. Which is impossible. So that suggests something's wrong with the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors, not the face angles. Hmm. Maybe I should find another approach.

Another thought: The interplanar distance can also be calculated using the formula involving the unit cell vectors. For a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c, the d-spacing is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a_x + k b_x + l c_x)^2 + (h a_y + k b_y + l c_y)^2 + (h a_z + k b_z + l c_z)^2 )

But in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice vectors can be expressed as a, a, a, with angles between them of 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the vectors are arranged such that each pair has an angle of 30 degrees. So, for example, the a, b, and c vectors each have magnitude a, and the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

Wait, but then the direction cosines would come into play. Maybe it's easier to model the lattice vectors in a coordinate system.

Let me try to model the vectors. Let's choose vector a along the x-axis, so a = (a, 0, 0). Vector b is in the xy-plane, making an angle α=30 degrees with a. So b = (a cos α, a sin α, 0). Vector c is at an angle α=30 degrees from a and from b. Hmm, but this might be complicated.

Another approach: The volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α (cos α + cos β cos γ) )? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is a^3 times something, but that might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps another way: For a rhombohedral system, the relationship between the reciprocal vectors can be used. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h = (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane (111) is such that the reciprocal of the d-spacing is given by the square root of the sum of the reciprocals of the projections along each axis. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula specific to rhombohedral systems. I recall that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Where α is the angle between the edges. So for (111), this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2 (1+1+1) cos30 )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, same problem as before. Negative under the square root. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the formula is incorrect. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle or something. Like, maybe the angle in the formula is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Let me try that.

So cos(150) = cos(180-30) = -cos30 = -√3/2 ≈ -0.866.

So substituting:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6*(-0.866) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 5.196 ) = a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a / 2.863.

Wait, a is 10 Angstrom, so 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But that's not one of the options. The options are around 8-10.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach either.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is 1/d² = ( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 ) / (a^2 b^2 c^2) ) - ... Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative way. Let me think: in a rhombohedral crystal, the (111) planes are equivalent. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. But wait, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. Or perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in the rhombohedral system.

Wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal. In a simple cubic structure, that's equal to 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, how is it related?

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', the lattice parameter. So a = 10 Angstrom.

So going back to the formula, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the formula for 1/d^2 is given by:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos α)/(a²) - (2 hl cos β)/(a²) - (2 kl cos γ)/(a²)

So for (111), substituting the values:

= (3)/(a²) - (2 *1 *1 cos30)/(a²) * 3 (since hk, hl, kl each have cos30)

So:

= [3 - 6 cos30 ] / a²

As before, which gives 3 -6*(√3/2) = 3 -3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196= -2.196.

So 1/d² = -2.196 / a². Which is negative, so d is imaginary. That can't be possible.

Hmm, that suggests that for (111) plane, this would be impossible, which can't be right. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake in applying it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different kind of rhombohedral system. Maybe in this case, the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me see.

Wait, if the angles were 60 degrees, then cos60 = 0.5.

Then 1/d² = [3 -6*(0.5)] /a² = (3-3)/a²=0 → d approaches infinity. That's not possible either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different when all angles are equal. Maybe another approach is needed.

Another approach: The interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But for a rhombohedral system, α=β=γ=30°, so:

d_{111} = a / sqrt(3 - 2 [ cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ] )

Wait, wait, no. Because the term is 2 hk cosα, 2 hl cosβ, 2 kl cosγ. So for (111), each hk, etc., is 1, so:

Denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*1*1*(3 cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Again, same problem.

Hmm, but 3 -6 cos30 is negative, leading to an imaginary d. That can't be correct. So perhaps the initial formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the Bravais lattice and the structure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the (111) plane doesn't exist for this structure, but the question says to compute it, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula signs. Maybe the formula should have a plus instead of a minus. Let me try.

If the formula is d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30), then:

cos30 is about 0.866, so 6 * 0.866 =5.196. 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d =10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom, which is not among the options. The options are all around 9 Angstrom. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another approach. Maybe the question is about the face-centered or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but a different parameter.

Wait, wait. The question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' as that's the distance along the cube edge. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be simply 'a', but the distance between nearest neighbors along the edges.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is connected to its neighbors along the edges, so the interatomic distance would be 'a'. So 'a' is 10 Angstrom.

But then why is the formula giving a negative denominator? That suggests I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, I think perhaps I should derive the formula. Let's try.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and the angle between any two vectors is α=30 degrees.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector in reciprocal space.

The reciprocal vectors are given by:

h = (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, so the magnitude squared is:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α.

Wait, no, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

Reciprocal vectors (u, v, w) are such that:

u = h a* + k b* + l c*, where a*, b*, c* are reciprocal basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a_x + k b_x + l c_x )² + (h a_y + k b_y + l c_y )² + (h a_z + k b_z + l c_z )² )

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the lattice vectors.

Let me model the lattice vectors a, b, c as vectors in 3D space.

Let me assume vector a is along the x-axis: a = (a, 0, 0).

Vector b is in the xy-plane, making an angle α=30 degrees with a. So b = (a cos α, a sin α, 0).

Vector c makes an angle α=30 degrees with a and with b. To find the components of c, we can use the dot product.

The dot product of a and c is |a||c| cos α = a^2 cos30.

Since a is along x, the x-component of c is a cos30. Let me denote c as (a cos30, c_y, c_z).

The dot product of b and c is |b||c| cos α = a^2 cos30.

Dot product of b and c:

b . c = (a cos α)(a cos30) + (a sin α)(c_y) + 0 * c_z = a^2 cos30.

So,

a cos α * a cos30 + a sin α * c_y = a² cos30.

Divide both sides by a²:

cos α cos30 + (sin α) (c_y / a) = cos30.

We have α=30 degrees.

So,

cos30 cos30 + sin30 (c_y /a ) = cos30.

Compute cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, sin30=0.5.

So,

0.866 *0.866 + 0.5 * (c_y /a ) = 0.866.

0.75 + 0.5 (c_y/a ) = 0.866.

So,

0.5 (c_y/a )= 0.116 → c_y/a = 0.232 → c_y = 0.232 a.

Now, the magnitude of c is a, so:

(a cos30)^2 + (0.232 a)^2 + c_z^2 = a².

Compute:

cos30^2 = (0.866)^2 ≈0.75, so (a cos30)^2 = 0.75 a².

(0.232 a)^2 ≈0.0538 a².

So 0.75 a² +0.0538 a² = 0.8038 a².

So c_z² = a² -0.8038 a² =0.1962 a² → c_z = sqrt(0.1962) a ≈0.443 a.

So c vector is (0.866 a, 0.232 a, 0.443 a).

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

G_{hkl} = h (a) + k (b) + l (c)

But I'm a bit confused about how to compute the reciprocal vectors. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice.

But maybe an easier approach is to find the plane (111) and compute the distance.

The plane (111) has a normal vector n = a + b + c.

So n = a + b + c.

Compute n:

a is (a,0,0)

b is (a cos30, a sin30, 0) = (0.866a, 0.5a, 0)

c is (0.866a, 0.232a, 0.443a)

So,

n = a + b + c = (a + 0.866a +0.866a, 0 + 0.5a + 0.232a, 0 +0 +0.443a )

Compute each component:

x: a (1 +0.866 +0.866 )= a (2.732 )

y: 0 +0.5a +0.232a = 0.732a

z: 0 +0 +0.443a = 0.443a

So n = (2.732 a, 0.732 a, 0.443 a )

The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of n divided by (hkl) plane:

d = 1 / |n|.

But wait, the formula for interplanar distance is d = 1/ |n|, where n is the normal vector in reciprocal space. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The interplanar distance d is given by d = 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector for the (hkl) plane. But in real space, the normal vector to the plane is G, and the interplanar distance is d = 2π / |G|.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is d = 2π / |G|, where G = h a* + k b* + l c*.

But I'm getting a bit stuck with the reciprocal vectors approach. Maybe I can compute the magnitude of n and then find 1/d.

Wait, the normal vector in real space is n = a + b + c. The interplanar distance d is the distance between adjacent planes, which can be found by d = (n · r ) / |n|, where r is the displacement vector between two points in adjacent planes. But perhaps a simpler approach is to compute 1/d as |n|.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the distance between planes is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector in reciprocal space. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The distance between two adjacent planes (111) is given by d = 1 / |n|, where n is the normal vector in reciprocal space.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should compute the magnitude of n and then invert it.

The magnitude of n is sqrt( (2.732 a)^2 + (0.732 a)^2 + (0.443 a)^2 )

Compute each term:

(2.732 a)^2 ≈7.464 a²,

(0.732 a)^2 ≈0.536 a²,

(0.443 a)^2 ≈0.196 a².

Sum: 7.464 + 0.536 +0.196 =8.196 a².

So |n|= sqrt(8.196 a² ) = a * sqrt(8.196) ≈ a * 2.863.

So the magnitude is 2.863 a.

So d = 1/(2.863 a) ?

Wait, that would give d ≈ (1/2.863)* (10) ≈3.49 Angstrom. But the options are all in the ~9-10 range. So this can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the formula for the normal vector is not correct.

Wait, another thought: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

But earlier, substituting the numbers gives a negative denominator. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as 3 - 6 cos30, but take the absolute value. So sqrt of the absolute value.

Wait, but in that case, the denominator becomes sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| ), which is sqrt(6 cos30 -3 ), because 6 cos30 is larger than 3.

So 6 cos30 is ~5.196, which is larger than 3, so 6 cos30 -3 = 2.196.

So denominator is sqrt(2.196) ≈ 1.48.

So d = a / 1.48 ≈10 /1.48 ≈6.76 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but why would I take the absolute value? That doesn't seem right, as the formula is derived from the structure.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or perhaps see if the given options make sense.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 9.08

B) 8.95

C) 9.54

D)10.05.

These are all close to 10 Angstrom, which is the given interatomic distance. So perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is slightly less than 10.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) )

In that case, for (111), d = 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstrom. Not matching options.

But maybe the angle is such that the denominator is smaller, so d is larger.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - ... ), which turns out to be a number that when divided into 10 gives around 9.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and should use a different approach. Maybe the interplanar distance is given by a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, no, same result as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that's just a guess. Let's try that.

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

3 +6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180-α) )

Because if the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, then the angle in the formula might be 180-30=150 degrees.

So cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3)(-0.866) ) = sqrt(3 + 5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But in this case, for (111), we have:

3 - 6 cos30 =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so d would be imaginary. So that can't be.

Wait, but that suggests that the (111) plane does not exist in this structure, which contradicts the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is designed for a different kind of rhombohedral system, like when angles are larger than 90 degrees, or perhaps I'm using the wrong kind of angle (like the angle between the planes instead of the vectors).

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps I can look for a formula online or in a textbook, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to proceed with what I have.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

In our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 (1)(1)(0.866) *3 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 - 5.196 )= 10/sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (180 - α) instead.

If α is 30, then 180-30=150, and cos(150)=-0.866.

So:

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2* (1) * (-0.866)*3 )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196) =10/ sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the distance between two adjacent (111) planes, which is the same as the lattice parameter a, but that would be 10, which is option D. But that seems unlikely because the (111) plane is not the same as the lattice parameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )

Which would give 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77, which is not an option.

Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral system is such that the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, and the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos α )

But that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the denominator as 3 -6 cos30, take the absolute value, and then proceed.

So denominator = sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| ) = sqrt(6 cos30 -3 )=sqrt(5.196 -3)=sqrt(2.196)=1.48.

d=10/1.48≈6.76 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30)=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. No.

Wait, maybe the formula is reciprocal. So perhaps it's:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that would make d= 10 * sqrt(3 -5.196)=10* sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 2 cos^3 α )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, for α=30 degrees, cos30= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*0.866 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 -2.598 + 2*(0.6495) =1-2.598 +1.299= (1+1.299) -2.598= 2.299 -2.598= -0.299.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(-0.299), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So perhaps the formula is incorrect or the angles are different.

Hmm, perhaps the given angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's test.

If α=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

Then,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.5) +2*(0.5)^3 )= sqrt(1-1.5 +2*(0.125)) = sqrt(-0.5 +0.25)= sqrt(-0.25), again imaginary. So that can't be.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the volume. Another formula for the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma )

But for α=β=γ=30°, this becomes:

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute:

sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. (sqrt(3)/2)^2=3/4=0.75.

So,

Inside the sqrt: 1 -3*(0.75) +2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(0.75)=2.25.

(sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3*sqrt(3))/8 ≈ (5.196)/8≈0.6495.

So,

1 -2.25 +2*(0.6495) =1-2.25 +1.299= (1+1.299)-2.25= 2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049)= a^3 *0.221.

V≈ a^3 *0.221. So for a=10, V≈1000 *0.221≈221 Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume. The volume can also be expressed as V= a b c sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma )

Which for a= b= c=10 and angles 30°, gives V=1000 * sqrt( the same term as before )

But again, I'm not sure how to connect that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, and the negative indicates that the (111) planes are not present in this structure, but the question says to compute it, so perhaps the formula has a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate 3 -6 cos30.

cos30= sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

So 6 cos30= 6 *0.8660=5.196.

3 -5.196= -2.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So perhaps the (111) planes are not present in this structure, which would mean that the d-spacing is zero. But that's not an option in the question.

Wait, perhaps the planes are (100), (110), etc., but the question specifies (111). Hmm.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to compute the options. Let me see which option, when plugged into the formula, gives a positive denominator.

Suppose that d is 9.08 Angstrom (option A).

So 1/d² = (3 -6 cos30 ) / a² → 1/(9.08)^2 = (3 -5.196)/100 → 1/(82.4464)= (-2.196)/100 → 0.00002426 = -0.02196 → which is impossible.

Same for option B (8.95):

1/(8.95^2)=1/79.  ≈0.01265.

Which would mean (3-5.196)/100= -0.02196.

So 0.01265 = -0.02196 → Impossible.

Option C: 9.54:

1/(9.54)^2=1/91≈0.010989.

So, (3 -5.196)/100= -0.02196 → 0.010989 = -0.02196 → No.

Option D:10.05:

1/(10.05)^2=1/101≈0.0099.

So (3-5.196)/100= -0.02196 → 0.0099 = -0.02196 → No.

So all options give negative 1/d², which is impossible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So then for (111):

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle as 180-30=150 degrees, cos(150)= -0.866.

So:

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6*(-0.866) )=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is A)9.08, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is 'a', and the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance between two atoms in the (111) direction.

But that's the interatomic distance, which is given as 10 Angstrom.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance. So option D is 10.05, which is close. But the options are all around 9-10, so perhaps that's not the case.

I'm really not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But since that gives a negative denominator, perhaps the correct answer is not possible, but the question must have a solution. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, and the given options are wrong. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - α) )

Which would give:

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6 cos(150) )=10/sqrt(3 -6*(-0.866) )

=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - α) )

Which would give:

3 +6 * cos(150) =3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196 =-2.196. Negative.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. Since none of the options make sense with my current approach, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral system is such that the angles are all 60 degrees, not 30. Let me try that.

So cos60=0.5.

Then, denominator is sqrt(3 -6 *0.5)=sqrt(3-3)=0 → division by zero. So that's not possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But this leads to a negative denominator.

I'm really stuck here and need to find another approach. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B)8.95, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But perhaps I should compute the denominator as sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )=sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value.

So denominator is sqrt(6 cos30 -3 )=sqrt(5.196-3)=sqrt(2.196)=1.48.

d=10/1.48≈6.76 Angstrom. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B)8.95, but I can't find a way to reach it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which, for (111) and all angles 30°, becomes:

d=10/sqrt(3 -6 cos30 )=10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196)= imaginary. So no.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But perhaps I should take the absolute value of the denominator.

So denominator is sqrt( |3 -6 cos30| )=sqrt(6 cos30 -3 )=sqrt(5.196-3)=sqrt(2.196)=1.48.

d=10/1.48≈6.76 Angstrom. Still no.

I'm really stuck. Since the options are around 9 Angstrom, perhaps the correct approach is to take d≈a / sqrt(1) =a=10, but that's option D. But why would the denominator be 1?

Wait, if the denominator is 1, then h² +k² +l² - ...=1.

In our case, hkl=111.

So 3 - 6 cos30 = 3-5.196= -2.196. So that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But with the angles being 30°, but perhaps I mistakenly used cos30 instead of something else.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees. Let's try that.

So cos60=0.5.

Denominator: 3 -6 *0.5 =3-3=0. So d approaches infinity. Not possible.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none of them yield an option in the given choices. Perhaps the correct answer is B)8.95, but I can't find a way to compute it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is larger than the interatomic distance. If the formula for the denominator is different, perhaps it's sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ), which would be sqrt(3)=1.732, making d=10/1.732≈5.77. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) ) which is 10/sqrt(3)=5.77. Again, not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and can't find a way to get to the options given. Perhaps the correct answer is A)9.08, but I have no idea how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d² = (3)/(a²) - (2*(3)*cos30)/a² → 3 -6 cos30 =3-5.196= -2.196. But since 1/d² is negative, perhaps I should take the absolute value, leading to 1/d² =2.196/100 → d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.76 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(180-α) )

So cos(150)= -0.866.

Denominator=3 -6*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

No.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to reach the given options. I must have made a mistake in the formula or approach. Given the options, the closest to my incorrect calculation of ~3.5 is not present, so perhaps the correct answer is not among them, but the intended answer might be option A)9.08.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma}}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 - 6 \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \cos 30^\circ \)
\[
\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator
\[
3 - 6 \cos 30^\circ = 3 - 6(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the result
The denominator involves the square root of a negative number (\( \sqrt{-2.196} \)), which is not physically meaningful. This suggests that the (111) plane does not exist in this rhombohedral structure, as the interplanar distance would be imaginary.

### Step 5: Reassess the formula
Given the negative result, it is possible that the formula was misapplied. Another approach is to take the absolute value of the denominator:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{|3 - 6 \cos 30^\circ|}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{6 \cos 30^\circ - 3}}
\]

Substituting \( \cos 30^\circ \approx 0.866 \):

\[
6 \cos 30^\circ - 3 = 6(0.866) - 3 = 5.196 - 3 = 2.196
\]

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2.196}} \approx \frac{10}{1.48} \approx 6.76 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are all close to 9–10 Å.

### Step 6: Consider alternative interpretations
The interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal is typically smaller than the lattice parameter \( a \). However, the options provided (A: 9.08 Å, B: 8.95 Å, C: 9.54 Å, D: 10.05 Å) suggest that the interplanar distance is close to the lattice parameter. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the formula or the interpretation of the problem.

### Step 7: Final assessment
Given the mismatch between the calculated results and the provided options, and assuming the question intends for a valid interplanar distance close to 9 Å, the most reasonable choice is **A: 9.08 Å**.

Answer: A
