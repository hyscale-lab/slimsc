Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about calculating the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The question gives their masses, molar masses, and the temperatures are 25°C. Oh, and they also provide the Ka values for H3PO4, which are important for determining pH or something like that.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? So the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions in the solution. 

Let me think about what I know. When you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, what happens? I think these are buffer solutions. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2- when it dissolves. So in solution, you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can react with water, and their equilibrium depends on the pH.

But wait, the problem asks for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. How do I get that from H3PO4's dissociation? So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can lose three protons, each step with different Ka values. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-; the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-; and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

But in solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, I think the pH would be such that the predominant species are these. To find the concentration of PO4^3-, I probably need to consider the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), making PO4^3- a very small concentration.

But wait, how do I approach this? Maybe I should first calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution, then figure out how they interact.

So the solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Each of the salts is 1.00 g. Let me compute their moles.

For KH2PO4: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol. Wait, let me compute that precisely. 1 / 136.09 is about 0.007338. So approximately 0.007338 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 mol.

So in the solution, we have 0.007338 mol of KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and 0.005606 mol of Na2HPO4·2H2O, which gives HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-: so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is +1 each). So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the concentrations in the solution are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02803 M.

So now, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. I think these will establish a buffer system. But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

But to find [PO4^3-], I need [H+], which depends on the pH of the solution. Wait, but how can I find [H+] here? Because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the buffer is in the second dissociation step of H3PO4. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^-, the second gives HPO4^2-, and the third gives PO4^3-. So the solution is primarily a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the pH of the solution would be determined by the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That buffer's pKa is the second one, which is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. The pKa would be log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, because pKa = -log(Ka). So 6.2e-8 is around 7.208. Hmm, but wait, in the buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers: [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03669 M. So the ratio is 0.02803 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.764.

So log(0.764) is approximately log(0.76) ≈ -0.117. So pH = 7.208 + (-0.117) ≈ 7.091.

Wait, that's around pH 7.09. So now, knowing the pH, I can find [H+], which is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. 10^(-7.09) is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09). 10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.09) is about 0.81. So 8.1e-8 M. Let's say approximately 8.2e-8 for [H+].

Now, back to the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M, and [H+] is approx 8.2e-8 M.

Plug in the numbers: (1.8e-12) * 0.02803 / (8.2e-8).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Then, divide by 8.2e-8: 5.0454e-14 / 8.2e-8 = approximately 6.153e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.15e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the [H+] more accurately. The pH was 7.091, so [H+]=10^(-7.091)=?

Using a calculator: 10^(-7.091) = 10^(-7 - 0.091) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.091.

10^0.091 is about 1.23, so 10^-0.091 is about 0.813. So 1e-7 * 0.813 = 8.13e-8.

So [H+] is approximately 8.13e-8 M.

Now, plugging into [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.13e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.0454e-14.

Denominator: 8.13e-8.

So 5.0454e-14 / 8.13e-8 = let's compute that.

5.0454e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.13) * 1e-6.

5.0454 divided by 8.13 is approximately 0.6207.

So 0.6207e-6 is 6.207e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.21e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's very close. So why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me recompute the exact steps.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007338 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so [H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 / 0.2 = 0.03669 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005606 mol. So [HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

pH calculation: using Henderson-Hasselbalch.

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, wait, pKa2 is -log(Ka2). So Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = 7.208.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.02803/0.03669).

Compute 0.02803 / 0.03669 = approx 0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.115 = 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) → precise calculation. 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^0.093 is approximately 1.238, so 10^(-0.093) is 1 / 1.238 ≈ 0.807.

Thus, [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.

Recomputing [PO4^3-] now.

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.07e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.07e-8: 5.0454e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0454 /8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0454 /8.07 ≈ 0.6254.

So 0.6254e-6 = 6.254e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.25e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close. So I think the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I consider the activity coefficients or any other factors? Probably not; the problem assumes ideal behavior, so it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach. Another way to think about it is that in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step, which is very small. So maybe it's easier to model it using the third dissociation.

But the initial approach seems correct: find the pH based on the buffer, then compute [PO4^3-] using Ka3.

Wait, another thought: could the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations be adjusted for their dissociation beyond the buffer? Like, considering that HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-, but that's what we're calculating, so I think we're okay.

So with that, I think the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of H₃PO₄ and the given buffer system. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ (providing H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (providing HPO₄²⁻). The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) arises from the third dissociation step of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). To calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻, we first determine the pH of the solution using the buffer system formed by H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

Here, \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). The concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are calculated from the given masses and molar masses:

\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \div 0.2 \, \text{L} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \div 0.2 \, \text{L} \approx 0.02803 \, \text{M}
\]

Substituting these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02803}{0.03669} \right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is then:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:

\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803)}{(8.07 \times 10^{-8})}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803) \approx 5.0454 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Then divide by the denominator:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0454 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This result is very close to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)). Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is:

**Answer: A**
