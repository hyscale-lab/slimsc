Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment involves a bicistronic vector with specific regulatory elements and stop cassettes. They transfected this into primary astrocyte cultures and then made a mouse model. When they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, they expected some green signal but didn't find any. I need to figure out why.

Alright, let me think about the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one transcript. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, so that might allow internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be translated after the ligand.

Stop cassettes are in there too. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh wait, I remember that in Cre/lox systems, loxP sites are recognized by Cre to excise the floxed regions. Lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine with loxP, so maybe it's used for something else here.

Wait, how does the expression work? So, the vector is bicistronic, so it's a single mRNA that codes for both ligand and receptor. The mRNA is translated into ligand first, then the ribosome might terminate, but with an IRES upstream of the receptor, the ribosome can continue, allowing the receptor to be expressed as well. But the stop cassettes are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. 

So, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop), and the receptor by another (lox2272-stop). When Cre is introduced, it will recombine with the loxP sites and excise the stop. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed as well.

In the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So, the Cre should be active in neuralcrest-derived cells, like maybe the astrocytes in culture? Or in the mouse, SOX10-Cre would cause recombination in neural crest cells, so the offspring's tissues derived from neural crest would have the stops excised.

But wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So, when Cre is expressed, the loxP sites would be cut, removing the stop cassettes. That would allow mCherry to be expressed after ligand and eGFP after receptor.

In the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, they probably checked if the ligand and receptor proteins are present. The total proteins' signal correlates with actin, so normalization is fine. But in the mouse, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP wasn't expressed. So why isn't the receptor-eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. So they act on different cells. But the vector is in the same construct, so if the Cre is working, the eGFP should be expressed. But paracrine doesn't directly explain why it's not expressed in the construct.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed, but how does that relate to the construct? If the construct is correctly made, the eGFP should be expressed. But maybe the expression isn't happening because the vector isn't working.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES. So unless the enhancer is missing, but the promoter seems to be there. Also, the question says that antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, implying that the proteins are being made. Wait, but in the mouse, maybe the expression isn't happening because the enhancer isn't present in the construct. Or perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells where the Cre is active.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES. So, in the presence of Cre, both should be expressed. But the problem is that in the mouse, the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why?

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So, if the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, the eGFP would not be expressed. Or if the reading frame is wrong, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, the stop cassettes: the ligand ORF is followed by loxP-stop, and then mCherry. So, without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by lox2272-stop, so Cre would excise that, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which would activate Cre, leading to recombination. So the stops should be removed, and the fluorescent proteins should be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't showing up. So possible issues: the Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't recombining properly. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed for another reason.

Looking at the answer choices, option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly added because the reading frame is incorrect, leading to a frame shift. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe it's active. But if the IRES isn't working, perhaps the receptor isn't expressed. But IRES usually allows for translation without the need for a promoter for the second gene.

Another thought: the vector might have been designed so that after the stop cassettes are removed, the ORF is correctly in frame. If they're not in frame, then the fusion protein would be messed up, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, when you have a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. When Cre is introduced, it deletes the stop, so the receptor and eGFP are joined together. So the receptor's C-terminus is connected to eGFP's N-terminus. If the reading frames are not aligned, then the eGFP won't be expressed because the frame is wrong.

So, perhaps the lox2272-stop-lox2272 is preventing the correct expression. Or maybe the frame isn't correct after deletion.

Wait, the initial setup says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector is ligand- mCherry (after stop), and receptor-eGFP (after another stop). So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, but does the frame matter? Because the stop is in a cassette that's after the ORF. So the ORF would presumably be in frame, but if the stop was in between, perhaps the frame is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the question states that the ligand is under CBA promoter, so ligand would be expressed, but without the receptor, the eGFP wouldn't show.

Wait, in the Western blot after transfection, they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Maybe the ligand and receptor are expressed, but in the mouse, the eGFP isn't. So, perhaps in the mouse, the expression isn't happening because of the way the construct is set up.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the vector. The bicistronic construct has the ligand ORF first, then a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF, then another stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no: the vector is ligand ORF at the 5' end, with mCherry. Then, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the vector's structure is:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> stop cassette (loxP-stop) --> mCherry

IRES --> Receptor --> stop cassette (lox2272-stop) --> eGFP

Wait, maybe not. The vector is bicistronic, so the first ORF is ligand under CBA, then the second is receptor under IRES. The stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is expressed with eGFP, but the stop prevents eGFP.

Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is at 5', with a stop cassette. So, the construct is:

5' (ligand ORF) --> loxP-stop --> mCherry

Then, after IRES, (receptor ORF) --> lox2272-stop --> eGFP.

So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are in the same reading frame but the stop is in between, so mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor and eGFP are similarly connected, but stop prevents eGFP.

When Cre is present, it will recognize the loxP sites and excise the stop cassettes. So, the ligand and mCherry are expressed together, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed together.

So, in the mouse, the Cre is active (from SOX10-Cre), so the stop cassettes should be removed, leading to both mCherry and eGFP expression.

But the question says that after crossing, the eGFP isn't visualized. So why?

Looking at the options again.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent eGFP from being on the surface, maybe, but if the construct is correctly made, the eGFP should be expressed and visible. But perhaps the protein isn't even made.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but in the wrong frame, leading to no eGFP production.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly designed. Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, the loxP and lox2272 are used for Cre-mediated recombination.

Wait, the lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre, but only in a specific orientation. So, if the vector has loxP and lox2272 in the correct orientation, Cre will cut both. But if the lox2272 is in a different orientation, Cre might not cut. Or perhaps the vector has loxP on both sides, and the lox2272 is not compatible.

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP-stop for the ligand and lox2272-stop for the receptor. So, when Cre is introduced, it would cut the loxP sites, removing the stop for the ligand and mCherry. But for the receptor and eGFP, the stop is under lox2272. Since Cre recognizes lox2272, would it cut that as well?

I think Cre can recognize lox2272 sites, but only when they are in a certain configuration. Wait, no. The lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, which is recognized by Cre. But lox2272 can be recombined when paired with another lox2272 site, but not with loxP. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. lox2272 is a modified site that is only cut by Cre in the presence of a lox2272 site on the other side. So, if the vector has lox2272 on both ends of a cassette, Cre would recognize and cut them. But if one is loxP and the other is lox2272, the Cre won't cut. So, in the vector, the ligand's stop is between loxP sites, and the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites. So when Cre is introduced, it will cut the loxP sites, removing the ligand's stop. But the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites; Cre can't cut them unless paired with another lox2272. So, the receptor's stop cassette remains, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but how? The vector's design is that the ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, when Cre is introduced, it would only cut the loxP sites, so the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains. That would mean that the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, which is why no green signal is observed.

In that case, the problem is that the receptor's stop cassette isn't flanked by loxP sites, so Cre can't remove it. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains.

Looking back at the options, none directly state this. But option C says the enhancer for the expression is missing. Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand and mCherry expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't. So, perhaps the issue is that the Cre cannot excise the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the question, the construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, perhaps the lox2272 is not recognized by Cre, or the vector isn't designed to allow both stops to be excised.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different. Cre can recognize and cut loxP sites, but lox2272 is a mutant that can be cut by Cre, but only in certain contexts. Wait, no—lox2272 is a site that Cre can cut, but it requires another lox2272 site. If the construct has lox2272 on both sides of the stop, then Cre would cut them and remove the stop. But if the construct has loxP and lox2272, the Cre won't cut that.

So, the vector has the ligand's stop flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop flanked by lox2272. So, the ligand's stop would be removed by Cre, but the receptor's stop remains because Cre can't cut lox2272 sites unless they're paired with another lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why did the question include that the ligand is under CBA and the receptor has an IRES? Oh, maybe the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because its stop isn't removed.

So the problem is that the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, and Cre can't cut them, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Looking at the options, the only one that relates is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But in this scenario, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't even expressed because the stop is in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't functional with Cre, so the stop remains. But the options don't directly say that. The options given are:

A) paracrine — probably not.

B) stuck in Golgi — that affects localization, but not expression.

C) enhancer missing — but CBA is the promoter.

D) frame issue — would affect expression.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong earlier. If the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why isn't the stop excised? Because the vector has the wrong lox sites.

Wait, maybe the vector uses two different lox sites, so only one is cut. So when Cre is introduced, it only cuts the loxP sites, allowing the ligand expression, but the receptor's stop remains. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is, why didn't the eGFP get expressed. So the reason is that the stop wasn't removed because the lox sites are not compatible with Cre. But none of the options directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the receptor's ORF in the same frame as eGFP. If the stop is removed, but the frame is misaligned, the eGFP won't be expressed. So option D could be the reason.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so the ligand should be expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which allows it to be expressed downstream. But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, so the eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So possible explanations: the Cre isn't active, the lox sites are wrong, or something is wrong with the expression cassette.

Wait, another possibility: the vector was designed as a monomeric transmembrane receptor. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. Maybe the ligand and receptor aren't expressed because the vector isn't correctly allowing their expression. But that's more about protein function, not expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being translated. But the IRES usually allows cap-independent translation.

Wait, the problem says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after the IRES. So the ligand is expressed first, then the receptor. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed. Then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the presence of the IRES implies it should work.

Another thought: the stop cassettes are placed in a way that they interfere with the expression. For example, if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and the lox sites prevent the stop from being excised.

Wait, but the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, the design is that in the presence of Cre, both stops are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in this case, when using SOX10-Cre, only the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. So the problem is that the lox2272 sites are not being cut by Cre.

Wait, lox2272 is a site that Cre can cut but only when paired with another lox2272. So, if the stop cassette for the receptor is flanked by lox2272 sites, Cre can cut both and remove the stop. But if the vector only has one lox2272 site, it can't be cut, or perhaps the sites are in the wrong orientation.

Wait, the question states that between the receptor ORF and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, the stop is between two lox2272 sites. So, when Cre is present, it should cut both lox2272 sites, removing the stop and allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But in reality, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Maybe the vector doesn't have the correct reading frame for the eGFP. So, the stop is removed, but the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to a frameshift and eGFP not being expressed. So option D is the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being translated. But IRES is supposed to drive translation of the second gene.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 isn't being cut, but the question doesn't have that as an option. So, perhaps the answer isn't matching any option. But that's unlikely.

Looking back, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

That would mean they are secreted and act on other cells. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed in the same construct.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi.

If the protein isn't properly trafficked, the eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the immunoblot after transfection might have detected the protein. But the question says that after making the mouse, they didn't see the green signal. Maybe the protein is made but not in the right place.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing.

But the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so the enhancer shouldn't be a problem.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame.

If the stop is removed, but the frames don't match, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, considering all this, the most likely reason is that the stop isn't being removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question says the vector uses lox2272, which Cre can cut, so why isn't the stop removed?

Wait, perhaps the vector has a problem with the lox2272 sites. Suppose the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP sites. No, that shouldn't matter. Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't correctly placed between the lox sites.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are in the same orientation, so when Cre cuts the loxP sites, it doesn't affect the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP's stop remains.

Wait, but the lox2272 is a different recognition site. So, the presence of Cre would only cut the loxP sites, not the lox2272. So, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop remains. Hence, eGFP isn't expressed. But why isn't the eGFP expressed?

So the problem is that the stop for the receptor is flanked by lox2272 sites, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state that. So, looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, if the stop is still in place, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is there. But if the stop is removed, the frame must be correct for eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the vector's design is such that the lox2272 sites are present, but when Cre is introduced, they aren't cut. So the stop remains. Hence, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have an option about the lox sites not being cut. So, perhaps the correct answer is C: the enhancer for the expression is missing.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES. So, maybe the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the CBA promoter is not active in the cells where the Cre is active. For example, if the Cre is active in a cell type where CBA isn't active, then the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the question says the initial expression is in neural crest cells, and SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't being expressed in the mice. But the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so it's present.

Wait, maybe the expression is cell-type specific. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe it's expressed in all cells. But perhaps the IRES isn't functional because the genetic context is wrong. But the IRES is supposed to work regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector is designed such that the eGFP is only expressed if the stops are excised. But if the stops aren't excised, eGFP isn't expressed.

So, considering all this, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed by Cre, which could be due to the lox sites not being compatible. But since that's not an option, I'm looking at the given options again.

Looking at option C: enhancer for expression is missing. If there's no enhancer, the promoter might not be active. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But without the receptor, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the IRES not work?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has an issue with the lox sites. But without an option for that, I have to choose from the given options.

The initial setup says that the ligand and receptor are expressed in neural crest cells, but the vector is introduced into primary astrocyte culture. Wait, the question says they made a mouse model, so the expression should be in the mouse.

Wait, in the experiment, the construct was transfected into primary astrocyte culture. But perhaps the expression isn't happening there, but the mouse model is about the endogenous expression. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that only one of the fluorescent proteins is expressed. For instance, perhaps the mCherry is expressed but not the eGFP because the IRES isn't functional. But the question says that they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre. So, perhaps the Cre is active in the mouse, but the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Wait, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the reading frame is wrong. So, the option D would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a different reading frame for the eGFP. So, when the stop is removed, the frame shifts, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

So, after considering all possibilities, I think the most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The vector includes stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be excised by Cre recombinase. The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. After transfection into primary astrocyte culture and testing in a mouse model, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Vector Design**: The vector is bicistronic, allowing simultaneous expression of the ligand and receptor. The ligand is expressed under the strong CBA promoter, while the receptor is expressed via an IRES element. The stop cassettes prevent co-expression of mCherry with the ligand and eGFP with the receptor in the absence of Cre.

2. **Role of Cre**: SOX10-Cre mice were used to activate Cre recombinase, which should excise the stop cassettes. This would allow co-expression of mCherry with the ligand and eGFP with the receptor.

3. **Observed Outcome**: Despite the presence of Cre recombinase, no green signal (eGFP) was observed in the mouse offspring. This suggests that the receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not being expressed as expected.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **(A) Paracrine relationship**: This refers to ligand-receptor interactions between different cells. However, the vector design and experimental setup do not support this as a reason for the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **(B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: While improper trafficking could prevent surface expression, this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed at all.
   - **(C) Enhancer for expression is missing**: The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the IRES element is functional. There is no evidence to suggest an enhancer is missing.
   - **(D) Receptor and eGFP are not in frame**: If the stop cassette is not excised or if the reading frame is misaligned after excision, eGFP would not be expressed. This is the most likely explanation, as improper reading frame alignment would prevent proper expression of the eGFP fusion protein.

5. **Conclusion**: The absence of eGFP expression is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame after Cre-mediated excision of the stop cassette. This misalignment prevents proper expression of the eGFP fusion protein.

Answer: D
