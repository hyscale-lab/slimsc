Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to some constant multiplied by that expression, right? So maybe |alpha> is just that expression. Because if it's proportional, but we don't have the constant, perhaps we can normalize it later. But I should check if it's normalized already.

First, let's write down the state. The state is in the z-basis because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>.

So, |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

But wait, to find probabilities, I need to calculate the norm of this state. Because probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients, but first, the state must be normalized.

Wait, no. Wait. The state is given as proportional. So perhaps the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, and we need to normalize it. Because the given state might not have a norm of 1, so we have to find the normalization constant.

So, the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the inner product of the state with itself. Let me compute that.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1 - i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i). Wait, no. Wait, let me think. |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so <alpha| is (1 - i)<up| + (2 + i)<down|.

So the inner product is:

(1 - i)(1 + i) * <up|up> + (1 - i)(2 - i) * <up|down> + (2 + i)(1 + i) * <down|up> + (2 + i)(2 - i) * <down|down>.

But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, <up|down> is zero, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So, the inner product is (1 - i)(1 + i) + (2 + i)(2 - i).

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1² + (i)(-i) + ... Wait, actually, (a - b)(a + b) is a² - b². So (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Wait that's right. So the first term is 2.

The second term is (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2² - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

So, the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the first part of the problem is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator whose matrix representation is Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, let's write down the matrix A. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we have spin, which is two states), the matrix elements are:

A11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A12 = ħ/2
A21 = ħ/2
A22 =0

So the matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Hmm, wait. The operator is such that Aij is ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, this would be:

A = (ħ/2) * [ [0,1],[1,0] ]

Which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X swaps the basis states. So, the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Hmm, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator A, since A is a scalar multiple of σ_x.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? They are the spin states in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, yes. Because σ_x |+x> = |+x>, so A |+x> = (ħ/2) * |+x>.

So, the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2) * (1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2.

But how does this help us? The question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A. So, the measurement will collapse the state |alpha> into either |+x> or |-x>, and we need to find the probabilities of each.

So, the steps are:

1. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>).
2. The coefficients in this expansion give the amplitudes for each eigenstate.
3. The probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

We need to find a and b.

We can express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Combine terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we know the expression for |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Now, let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: (a - b) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

We can solve these two equations for a and b.

Add equation 1 and equation 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)

So a = (3) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 = (3 / 2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7)

So b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue ħ/2 (i.e., for |+x>) is |a|^2.

Similarly, the probability for eigenvalue -ħ/2 (i.e., |-x>) is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = (3) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ?

Wait, let me compute again. a = [3 * sqrt(2/7)] / 2.

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7). So:

a = [3 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) ] / 2 = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Alternatively, a = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)=sqrt(14).

So |a|^2 is (9)/(14).

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Let me compute the numerator: (-1 + 2i) has magnitude sqrt( ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )) = sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5).

So |b|^2 = [ (sqrt(5))^2 * (2) ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ].

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Compute the magnitude squared of b:

|b|^2 = [ (| -1 + 2i |^2) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ]

Wait, no. Because the denominator is (2 sqrt(7))^2, which is 4 *7 =28.

The numerator is | (-1 + 2i ) |^2 * (sqrt(2))^2.

| -1 + 2i |^2 is (1)^2 + (2)^2 =5.

(sqrt(2))^2 is 2.

So numerator is 5 * 2 =10.

So |b|^2 = 10 /28 =5/14.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, wait. The magnitude of a complex number (a + ib) is sqrt(a² +b²), so |z|^2 is a² +b². So for (-1 + 2i), |z|^2 is 1 +4=5.

Then, the expression for |b|^2 is | (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) |^2 / (2 sqrt(7))^2.

Wait, | (-1+2i) * sqrt(2) |^2 is | (-1+2i) |^2 * |sqrt(2)|^2 = 5 *2=10.

Denominator is (2 sqrt(7))² = 4 *7 =28.

So |b|^2 =10/28 =5/14.

So the probabilities are:

P(+x) = |a|^2 =9/14 ≈0.6429

P(-x) = |b|^2=5/14≈0.3571

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36.

But wait, 9+5=14, so these add up to 14/14=1, which is correct.

So the first part of the question gives the probabilities as approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match. Option B is 0.54 and 0.46, which also doesn't match. Option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which is the reverse.

So the probabilities for the eigenstates are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I computed |a|² correctly.

a = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|² = [9 * 2 ] / [4 *7 ] = 18/(28) = 9/14. Which is correct.

Hmm, so the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

So the first part of the answer is 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and the expectation value of σ_x in state |alpha> is <sigma_x>, then <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

So perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> and multiply by ħ/2.

Alternatively, compute <A> directly.

Let me compute <A> as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Matrix of A:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Express |alpha> as a column vector.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, the bra vector <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

A |alpha> is:

[ (ħ/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ],
[ (ħ/2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] ]

So:

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) * [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the dot product of <alpha| and A |alpha>.

Which is:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (ħ/2) [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Multiply them:

= (ħ/2) * [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] / (7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So adding first and second terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2) /7 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/(7).

Wait, wait, no: because in the expression above, the denominator is 7, so the entire thing is (2) /7.

So, (2/7) multiplied by (ħ/2) gives (2 * ħ) / (2 *7) )= ħ/7.

So, the average value is ħ/7.

So, putting it all together:

The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That's exactly what we have. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check option A. It says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. Yes. So the answer is option A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator and finding the average value of that operator. The state of the electron is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

where the normalization factor \(1/\sqrt{7}\) is determined by ensuring the state is normalized.

The operator in question has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]

which is proportional to the Pauli \(X\)-matrix. The eigenstates of \(A\) are the eigenstates of the spin operator in the \(x\)-direction:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), the state \(|\alpha\rangle\) is expressed as a linear combination of \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) into \(|\alpha\rangle\), the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) are determined by solving the system of equations:

\[
a + b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Solving these equations yields:

\[
a = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, the average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated using the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting the matrix representation of \(A\) and the coefficients of \(|\alpha\rangle\), the expectation value simplifies to:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value of the operator is \(\hbar/7\). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and \(\hbar/7\).**
