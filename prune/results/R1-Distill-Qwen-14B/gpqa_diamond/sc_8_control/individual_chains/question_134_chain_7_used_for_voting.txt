Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, this problem has more than just a simple acid and base. Let me read it again.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Oh, okay, so three solutions are being mixed together. So I need to find out how much heat is released (or absorbed) when they react.

First, I think I should figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because enthalpy changes depend on the amount of substance reacting.

Starting with HCl: it's a strong acid, monoprotic, so each mole gives one H+ ion. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume in liters.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

Then H2SO4: sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, so each mole can give two H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 would be 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, but when H2SO4 reacts, the first H+ is strong, but the second is weak. Hmm, but in neutralization reactions, especially with strong bases, I think both H+ might be considered. Or wait, in the context of enthalpy of neutralization, maybe all the H+ from the acid are considered. I'll have to think about that.

Then, Ba(OH)2: this is a strong base. Barium hydroxide. Since it's Ba(OH)2, each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles.

Total H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 moles.

So total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH-: 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait a second. When mixing, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. But who's in excess?

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

But wait, the reaction is between H+ and OH- to form water. So the total reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much water is formed and whether there's any excess.

So moles of H+ available: 0.28

Moles of OH-: 0.2

So OH- is the limiting factor. The reaction will proceed until all OH- is used up, which will consume 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

But wait, the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization usually refers to the reaction of H+ with OH- to form water. So the enthalpy change comes from how much H+ and OH- react.

But wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically based on the moles of H+ reacting, regardless of the source of the acid. So each mole of H+ that reacts contributes to the enthalpy change.

So the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). So the enthalpy change would be based on 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but what's the enthalpy per mole of H+? I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ/mol, but wait, wait: wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes it's given per mole of acid, but if the acid is polyprotic, like H2SO4, then the first H+ is about 57 kJ, and the second is around 19 kJ? Or wait, no—maybe the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ is about 57 kJ per mole for strong acids.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since it's exothermic). But wait, wait: the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, so 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, because 57 divided by 4.184 is approximately 13.6.

Wait, let me compute 57 divided by 4.184. 4.184 × 13 is 54.392, 4.184 × 13.6 is 57.0... Yes, so 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal.

So, if each mole of H+ contributes -13.6 kcal, then the total would be 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and the second H+ isn't as strong. But in the context of neutralization, especially with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, I think both H+ will react. Wait, but the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe the second H+ from H2SO4 doesn't release as much heat. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid is about 57 kJ/mol (or 13.6 kcal/mol). But for a weak acid, it's less because the reaction isn't as exothermic. But H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ and a weaker acid for the second H+.

So in the case of H2SO4, the first H+ will have the same enthalpy as a strong acid, but the second H+ will have a lower enthalpy of neutralization, maybe around 19 kJ/mol or so.

Wait, let me think. When H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ (from the first dissociation) is strong and will react completely. The second H+ comes from the second dissociation, which is weaker, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it also dissociates enough to react. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps since the problem mixes all the solutions together, the excess H+ comes from both acids, but the neutralization only involves the H+ and OH- reacting, regardless of the source.

Wait, but in any case, I think the approach is to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- available, then see how much can react, and multiply by the enthalpy per mole of H+.

But if the H+ from H2SO4's second dissociation doesn't release as much heat, then perhaps the first 0.2 moles of H+ (from HCl and first H+ of H2SO4) contribute 13.6 kcal/mol each, and any further H+ (like the second from H2SO4) contribute less.

Wait, but in this case, only 0.2 moles of H+ are reacting because OH- is 0.2. So maybe I don't need to worry about the second H+ of H2SO4, because the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, no. Let's get back. The problem is, all the solutions are mixed, so the H+ comes from all the acids, and OH- comes from the base.

So total H+ available: HCl gives 0.1 moles, H2SO4 gives 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles, so total 0.28 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So, the neutralization reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So, the moles of H+ that are involved in the neutralization are 0.2.

Now, the question is, how much heat is released when 0.2 moles of H+ neutralize with OH-.

But each H+ comes from different sources: some from HCl (strong acid, fully ionized), some from the first H+ of H2SO4, which is strong, and some from the second H+ of H2SO4, which is weaker.

So the first H+ from H2SO4 is strong (like HCl), but the second is weaker. So the enthalpy of neutralization for the first H+ is 13.6 kcal per mole, but the second is less.

But wait, in this reaction, only 0.2 moles of H+ are reacting. But some of them are from the first H+ of H2SO4, and others are from HCl.

Wait, no, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+. So the first 0.18 moles are from H2SO4 (each mole gives 2 H+, but the first is strong, the second is weak). But wait, no, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is fully ionized, the second is not (but in the presence of a strong base, the second H+ may also ionize, but with less dissociation).

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each H+ source and determine how much heat they contribute.

Case 1: HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+ → each contributes 13.6 kcal, so 0.1 ×13.6 = 1.36 kcal.

Case 2: H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles H+. Assuming that each mole of H2SO4 can release two H+. The first H+ is strong, so its neutralization releases 13.6 kcal per mole. The second H+ (if neutralized) would release less, perhaps around 19 kJ/mol, which is about 4.53 kcal/mol.

Wait, but the problem says that the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So only 0.2 moles of H+ (from the H+ pool) react.

So the H+ that actually reacts comes from the available H+ regardless of source. But the enthalpy per H+ depends on whether it's from a strong or weak acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps all H+ that react contribute 13.6 kcal per mole, assuming they're all from strong acids. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps only the first H+ of H2SO4 is considered strong, and the second is weaker. So, the first 0.09 moles of H2SO4 contribute 0.09 × 2 × 13.6? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

First H+ is strong, so each contributes 13.6 kcal when neutralized.

Second H+ is weak, so each contributes, say, 4.53 kcal (since 19 kJ is about 4.53 kcal).

So, for H2SO4, 0.09 moles would contribute 0.09 × 2 H+, but the first H+ (0.09 ×1 mole) contributes 13.6 × 0.09, and the second H+ (0.09 ×1 mole) contributes 4.53 × 0.09.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should treat each H+ individually.

Let me calculate:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+ → each 13.6 kcal, so 1.36 kcal.

First H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 moles → 13.6 × 0.09 = 1.224 kcal.

Second H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 moles → 4.53 × 0.09 ≈ 0.4077 kcal.

So total H+ available from all sources: 0.1 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.28 moles.

But only 0.2 moles react with OH-.

So which H+ reacts first? Strong acids' H+ react first because they're more available.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strongest acids first.

So, the OH- (0.2 moles) will react with H+ from HCl first, since HCl is a strong acid, then with H2SO4's first H+.

But wait, HCl has 0.1 moles H+, and H2SO4's first H+ is 0.09 moles.

So, OH- will first neutralize all 0.1 moles of HCl's H+, and then 0.1 moles of H2SO4's first H+.

So, the total reacting H+ is 0.2 moles (0.1 from HCl and 0.1 from H2SO4's first H+).

So, the enthalpy would be:

HCl's 0.1 moles → 0.1 ×13.6 = 1.36 kcal.

H2SO4's first 0.1 moles → 0.1 ×13.6 = 1.36 kcal.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 has 0.09 moles initially. If I use 0.1 moles of it, that's more than available. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Because H2SO4 has only 0.09 moles of first H+ (since 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4, each provides one mole of first H+).

So, HCl has 0.1 moles of H+.

So when OH- is 0.2 moles, it will first neutralize all 0.1 moles from HCl, then neutralize 0.1 moles from H2SO4's first H+ (since that's the next strongest). But H2SO4 has only 0.09 moles of first H+. So, it can only donate 0.09 moles.

So, after HCl's H+ (0.1 moles) and H2SO4's first H+ (0.09 moles), total H+ neutralized is 0.19 moles. That's less than the available 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but OH- is 0.2, so after 0.19, there's still 0.01 moles of OH- left. But H2SO4's second H+ is weak. So the remaining 0.01 moles of OH- would react with the second H+ of H2SO4, but since that's weak, the enthalpy per mole is lower.

So the reaction would be:

- 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 ×13.6 = 1.36 kcal.
- 0.09 moles first H+ from H2SO4 → 0.09 ×13.6 = 1.224 kcal.
- 0.01 moles second H+ from H2SO4 → 0.01 ×4.53 ≈ 0.0453 kcal.

Total enthalpy change would be 1.36 + 1.224 + 0.0453 = 2.6293 kcal. Since it's exothermic, it's -2.6293 kcal.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. But where did I go wrong?

Alternatively, maybe I should assume that all H+ involved in neutralization contribute 13.6 kcal/mol, regardless of source. Because perhaps the problem simplifies it that way, considering all H+ as strong.

So, 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 ×13.6 = 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, that's a big assumption. Because some H+ may come from a weak acid and contribute less. But perhaps the question expects us to treat all H+ as strong, so each mole contributes 13.6 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ regardless of the acid strength. So in that case, 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this calculation.

Another thing to check: units. The options have kcal and kJ. Since the standard enthalpy is given in kcal, the answer is in kcal.

So the correct answer is option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH⁻} \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Since \( \text{OH⁻} \) is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) will react.

3. **Enthalpy of neutralization:**
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   The enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.
