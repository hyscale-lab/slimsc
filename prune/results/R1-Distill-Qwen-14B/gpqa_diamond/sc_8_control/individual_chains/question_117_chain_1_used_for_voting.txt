Okay, I'm trying to tackle this question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different rotations of plane-polarized light. So, they can't be the same when you flip them over.

The question gives four organic moieties, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these four.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the substituents on each benzene ring create a situation where the arrangement around the central bond leads to enantiomers. So, biphenyls can have conformational isomerism, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral. Are there any chiral centers here?

Looking at the structure, each benzene ring has substituents. The 2 and 2' positions have the dicarboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. Wait, is the central bond a single bond? Because if it's a single bond, the two rings can rotate. But if rotation is possible, maybe it's not chiral. Oh wait, but if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, but does the biphenyl have a central single bond that allows free rotation? Because if so, then the substituents can rotate to a position where the mirror image isn't different. But in some cases, the substituents might be too bulky or arranged in a way that rotation is hindered, leading to a fixed configuration. Alternatively, even if rotation is possible, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Alternatively, if it's a meso compound, it won't show optical isomerism. Let me think about the substituents.

In this case, on each benzene ring (the biphenyl structure), the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the ester groups, and 6 and 6' for nitro. So each ring has two substituents, but across the central bond. Let me imagine the structure: the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, maybe it's chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are on positions 2 and 2' on each ring, which are across the central bond. So maybe the arrangement is such that if you rotate the rings, the substituents would be in positions that are mirror images. Alternatively, perhaps each ring's substituents are arranged such that the biphenyl is not symmetrical, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, but that's not necessarily the case here.

Wait, another angle: the molecule is dimethyl, so each ester group is OMe. The two ester groups are at 2 and 2', and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' on each ring. So each ring has two substituents: one ester and one nitro? No, wait, each ring has two ester groups? Wait, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, so each ring has two substituents, 2 and 6, which are in the meta positions relative to each other. Hmm. So the substituents on each ring are at the 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group.

But wait, the biphenyl structure is 1,1', so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1-position. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connection point. So each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are ortho and para? Wait, in benzene, position 1 is the point of connection. Position 2 is adjacent, position 3 is next, etc.

So for each ring, substituents are at position 2 (which is adjacent) and position 6 (which is three positions away from 1, so para? Or is that meta? Wait, benzene numbering: 1 is the connection. Then 2 is adjacent, 3 is meta, and 4 is opposite, but in a six-membered ring, position 6 would be the same as position 2 in the other direction, right? Wait, no, in a benzene ring, position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged in a circle. So position 2 is adjacent, position 6 is also adjacent but in the opposite direction. So 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me imagine: position 1 is the point where the two benzene rings are connected. So position 2 is next to 1, position 3 is next to 2, 4, 5, 6, and then back to 1. So position 6 is the one next to position 5, which is across from position 2 (because 1 is connected to 2 and 6). Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring: 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 6 are across from each other relative to the connection point. So each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 (adjacent) and 6 (opposite to 2? Or maybe 6 is adjacent in the other direction.)

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is whether the molecule is chiral. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would be achiral. For instance, if the nitro groups and ester groups are arranged in a way that the whole molecule is symmetrical, then no optical isomerism.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Let's think: the substituents on each ring are 2 and 6. So on each ring, substituent A is at position 2, and substituent B is at position 6. If substituent A and B are different (nitro and ester), then perhaps the arrangement could be such that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but wait: because the two rings are connected, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on both rings are in the same relative positions, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe their arrangement leads to no symmetry.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be (CH3)CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH; 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HO-CH2-COOH, but wait, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOH?

Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the carbon chain is CH3-CH2-COOH. Wait, the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is the middle carbon. So the structure would be:

HO-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's 1-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, wait, let me clarify.

Carbon 1: COOH (carboxylic acid group)
Carbon 2: CH2 group? Or CH(OH) group.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are:

CH3-CH2-COOH.

So carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: COOH.

Wait, no, carbon 1 is the COOH, carbon 2 is the next, and carbon 3 is the CH3. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Oh wait, in carboxylic acids, the COOH is considered carbon 1. So for propanoic acid, it's:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's butanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH2CH2COOH. So it's:

COOH-CH2-CH3. So carbon 1 is COOH, carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH3.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is the CH2 group. So the structure would be HO-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but wait, that's impossible. Because the COOH is on carbon 1, and carbon 2 is CH2. So 2-hydroxy would be HO-CH2-COOH. But that's a secondary alcohol. Wait, but in that case, the structure is CH2(OH)COOH. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH? No, wait, wait. Maybe I'm confusing the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (R)- or (S)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is also known as (R)- or (S)-lactic acid.

Ah, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid. So when you make the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the methyl ester of lactic acid. Which is known to have optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. The ester would have the structure CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Its ester with methanol would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OMe, forming CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In this case, the structure would have a chiral center at the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached. Because that carbon is connected to four different groups: the hydroxyl (OH), the COOCH3 group, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the carbon chain is CH3 (carbon 1), CH(OH) (carbon 2), COOCH3 (carbon 3). So carbon 2 has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3 (no, wait, carbon 2 is connected to CH3 (carbon 1), OH, COOCH3 (carbon 3), and another CH3? No.

Wait, let me draw the structure:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C attached to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH group
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- And what's the fourth group? Wait, carbon 2 is a CH2 group? No, wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that carbon (carbon 2) is connected to CH3 (from carbon 1), OH, COOCH3 (from carbon 3), and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when it becomes the ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So carbon 2 (the CH(OH) part) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, that's four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that's four different groups attached to the same carbon. So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has optical isomerism.

So option 2 definitely has optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)C=O(Ph), that is, two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Wait, no, benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, so it's (Ph)₂CO. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group.

Wait, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen, and a single bond from the ketone. Wait, no, wait. The structure is (Ph)₂CO, so the carbonyl is at the center. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but that's a symmetrical structure. So the molecule is symmetric because both substituents on the carbonyl are phenyl groups. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl carbon. So it's not chiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. No, wait, wait: maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid.

Wait, but fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So when you make the dimethyl ester, it's dimethyl (E)-butenedioate.

So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂ in the trans configuration.

Wait, but wait, the structure is (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCOOH, and its ester would replace the -OH of each acid with OMe groups.

So the structure is MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

Wait, so the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO(OCH3) ?

No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, no: fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is the same but in the trans configuration. So the structure is HOOC-CR₂=CR₂-COOH, but trans.

So the dimethyl ester would be OMeOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually OMeOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, that's not right because that's a single bond. Wait, no, the structure is OMeOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs to have a chiral center or to have a plane of asymmetry. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either side. So, the structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me? No, no, I'm getting confused. Let me correct: fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration.

So the dimethyl ester is MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me, but in the trans form. So the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is: O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3? Wait, no, because it's a double bond between the two CH groups. So the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. Wait, no, fumarate is the di-ester where the two ester groups are on each end of a double bond.

Ah, correct structure: O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 is incorrect because that's a single bond. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. No, let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, that's succinic acid. No, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So the dimethyl ester would be MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me, but in the trans configuration.

So the structure is MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me, where the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond, does that create a situation where the molecule is chiral?

Wait, no. Because the molecule is symmetrical in a way. Let me think: the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So the structure would be:

O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond between the CH₂ groups? No, no, it's O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 isn't correct. It's O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with a double bond between the second and third carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 but with a double bond between the central two carbons. So, O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with a double bond: O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 becomes O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but that's a single bond. No, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, and the dimethyl ester is MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me. So the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

In the trans configuration, the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, is this molecule chiral? A molecule is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and has a stereogenic center or a stereogenic axis.

Wait, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each end. The substituents are OCH3 groups on each end. So, each end of the double bond has an OCH3 and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no: each end of the double bond is a CH group attached to an OCH3 and a COOCH3. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each end of the double bond is a CH group. Each CH is attached to an OCH3 and a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3. Wait, no, correct structure is O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the CH groups. So it's O=C(OCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but that's not correct. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether this molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, each end of the double bond has a CH group. Each CH is attached to an OCH3 and COOCH3 group. So each CH has two substituents: OCH3 and COOCH3, plus two H's? No, wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, each CH is connected to an OCH3, a COOCH3, and two H's?

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to OCH3, COOCH3, and two H's. So each CH group is CH(OCH3)(COOCH3)₂? No, wait, no. Each CH is attached to OCH3 and COOCH3, and two H's. So each CH is CH₂ with two substituents? No, perhaps each CH is CH–, with one substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule may not be chiral. In the trans configuration, the substituents are opposite each other, which may result in a plane of symmetry.

Wait, in the trans configuration, the two OCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So for the structure MeO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂Me (trans), does this have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if you imagine the double bond as the central axis, and the substituents on either side are the same, then a plane of symmetry would pass through the double bond. So, in the trans configuration, each end has an OCH3 and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, each end has one OCH3 and one COOCH3 group?

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each end is an ester group (OCH3), and the other substituents are the other ester groups. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think that dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound or not.

Wait, another approach: can the molecule be superimposed on its mirror image? In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the trans isomer is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, wait, wait:

In the trans configuration, the substituents on each end are on opposite sides of the double bond, but are they symmetric? Let's suppose the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has an OCH3 and a COOCH3 group. So each end has the same substituents. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Wait, but that's not correct because OCH3 and COOCH3 are different groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if a line is drawn through the center of the double bond, would the substituents mirror each other on either side?

In the trans configuration, each end has OCH3 and COOCH3, but arranged so that they are on opposite sides. So, looking from the top, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents on each end are on opposite sides, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps in trans, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Whereas in the cis configuration (maleic acid), the substituents are on the same side, creating a chiral center. Wait, no, because if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the groups are the same.

Wait, no, in dimethyl maleate (cis), the substituents are on the same side. If the substituents are different, then it's chiral. Wait, in dimethyl maleate, each end of the double bond has an OCH3 and a COOCH3 group. If both substituents on each side are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about an example. Take tartaric acid, which is a diastereomer of fumaric acid. In tartaric acid, the cis configuration leads to a chiral center because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. In fumaric acid (trans), the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite.

Wait, no, in the case of maleic acid (cis), the substituents are on the same side. If the substituents are different, then the molecule is chiral. But if the substituents are the same on each end, then it's symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate (trans), the substituents on each end are the same: OCH3 and COOCH3. So each end has the same groups. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (trans) does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but this contradicts some knowledge I have. I thought that maleic acid is chiral and fumaric acid is not. Let me think again. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans.

So, for maleic acid, the substituents are on the same side. If the substituents are different, the molecule is chiral. For example, if each end of the double bond has different groups, the molecule would be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate (trans), each end has the same substituents (OCH3 and COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical, hence achiral.

Wait, but wait, in the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans), each end of the double bond is OCH3 and COOCH3. So, each end has the same groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then what about dimethyl maleate (cis)? In that case, the substituents are on the same side. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, but if they're different, it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If so, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, and dimethyl fumarate (trans) is achiral because it's a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think about another approach. Does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? For the trans isomer, if the substituents on either end are mirror images, then a plane would exist. So, yes, in the trans form, the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure yet. Earlier, I was stuck. Let's think again: the molecule has two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. So, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged so that they can't be mirrored, leading to a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the entire molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.

Wait, but in the case of biphenyls, if the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can be chiral. For example, if each ring has a substituent in a position that doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the entire structure symmetric.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two benzene rings each have a nitro and a carboxylate group, and those are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. Otherwise, it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in such a way that they don't mirror each other.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's think about another approach. If the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If the biphenyl is connected at position 1, and each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond, then perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group at 2 and 6, but they're on the same side, then the arrangement could be such that the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I think I'm stuck on this one. So, perhaps I should make a note and come back after checking the other options.

Option 3: benzophenone, which I decided earlier doesn't have optical isomerism because it's symmetrical.

So, among the four options, I'm sure about options 2 and 4. Option 2 has a chiral center and thus has optical isomerism. Option 4, dimethyl fumarate, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's trans and thus not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I'm not certain about option 4. Let me think again: if the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (trans) is a symmetrical molecule, so no optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, which options exhibit optical isomerism? Option 2 does. Let me check the other options.

Option 1: If the molecule is chiral, then it does. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions don't mirror each other, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

Let me imagine the molecule. Each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on each ring, 2 is adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1), and 6 is the adjacent position in the other direction. So substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across the ring from each other.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents on each ring are symmetrical, making the entire molecule symmetrical. For example, if the nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side, leading to a lack of symmetry.

I'm not entirely certain, but I think that in this case, the molecule could be chiral. Because each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but their arrangement could lead to a lack of symmetry.

So, perhaps option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to sum up:

Option 1: Chiral (exhibits optical isomerism) → Yes

Option 2: Chiral → Yes

Option 3: Not chiral → No

Option 4: Not chiral → No

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So among the four options, which ones show optical isomerism?

The question lists four moieties, and the options A to D combine some of them.

So, the ones that show optical isomerism are 1, 2, and possibly 4? Or just 1 and 2.

Wait, but I'm not confident about option 1. Let's think again: biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Wait, perhaps I should look for whether the substituents on each ring are in positions that would allow free rotation to a symmetric position.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, the molecule could be symmetric. For example, if each ring's substituents are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if their positions are different, the molecule is chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given that the molecule has substituents in specific positions, it's possible that it's chiral. Therefore, option 1 exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the moieties that exhibit optical isomerism are 1, 2, and 4? Or 1 and 2?

Wait, earlier I thought option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism because the trans configuration is symmetrical. So, back to options:

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

If 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then option D would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought option 1 might exhibit it. So perhaps options 1 and 2 are correct, making option D the answer.

Alternatively, if only option 2 is correct, that's not an option. Let me look back.

Wait, from earlier analysis:

Option 1: Chiral → maybe yes.

Option 2: Chiral → yes.

Option 3: Not chiral → no.

Option 4: Not chiral → no.

Wait, but if option 1 is not chiral, then only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2.

So, if 1 is chiral and 2 is chiral, then D is correct. If 1 is not chiral, then only 2 is correct, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let me think again.

The structure of option 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other on the benzene ring.

Wait, so for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

But wait, in biphenyl, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, imagine the biphenyl with each ring having substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents are on opposite sides, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror, the molecule would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering that both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, the molecule could be symmetrical, making it not chiral.

So, perhaps option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is A, D, or C. Wait, the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1. Let me think: option 1's structure is such that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across the ring from each other. So the substituents are in positions that are opposite, leading to a molecule that is symmetrical. Thus, it's not chiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But that's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let me go back to dimethyl fumarate.

If dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, does it exhibit optical isomerism?

Hmm, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: when a molecule has a double bond with two identical substituents on each end, it's called a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two different substituents on each end, making it chiral. But if the substituents are the same on each end, the molecule could be a meso compound.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has OCH3 and COOCH3 groups. But are these groups the same?

No, OCH3 is different from COOCH3. So, each end of the double bond has two different substituents. So, in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, which could lead to a lack of a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, if you have substituents A and B on each end, and in the trans configuration, it's A on one side and B on the other. If A and B are different, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, in this case, for dimethyl fumarate, each end has OCH3 and COOCH3. So, substituents are different. So, in the trans configuration, the substituents are opposite each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but that's not correct. For example, if you have a double bond where each end has different substituents, the trans configuration would lead to a molecule that's not symmetrical, hence chiral.

Wait, let me think of a simple example: butene. CH₂=CHCH₂CH3 is a trans double bond. But that's not chiral because the substituents are the same on each end. But if each end has different substituents, then the trans configuration would make the molecule chiral.

Ah, right. So, if each end of the double bond has different substituents, the trans configuration would lead to a chiral center.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has OCH3 and COOCH3 groups. So, each end has a different substituent. Therefore, in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule chiral. Hence, dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, option 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, let's reevaluate:

Option 1: Not sure. Let's think again. If each ring's substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's not chiral. If not, then it is.

Option 2: Chiral → Yes.

Option 4: Chiral → Yes.

So, which options are correct? The ones that exhibit optical isomerism are 2 and 4.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 1, which may or may not be.

B) 3 and 4 → includes 3, which is not correct.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 is not correct.

D) 1 and 2 → includes 1 and 2.

Hmm, so if 2 and 4 are correct, but the options don't have an option that includes both, then perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recheck:

Option 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which after reevaluation, does exhibit optical isomerism. So, options 2 and 4 are correct.

Looking back at the options, only option A includes 2 and 4. But option A also includes 1, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps only options 2 and 4 are correct, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option 1.

Alternatively, perhaps only option 2 and 4 are correct, but I have to choose the best option from the given choices.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2.

So, if 2 and 4 are correct, but there's no option that includes only them, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 1.

Let me think again about option 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But, since each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the correct options are 2 and 4. But none of the options have both 2 and 4 except option A, which also includes 1.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans di-ester, is a meso compound. Because the substituents on each end are the same, making it achiral. So, in that case, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the substituents are different on each end, leading to a chiral molecule. Now I'm conflicting with myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to think that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, hence not chiral.

Wait, let me think of a specific example: dimethyl maleate is the cis di-ester. It has substituents on each end, which are different. So, it's chiral. But dimethyl fumarate (trans) has substituents on each end which are the same, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each end has OCH3 and COOCH3 groups, which are different. So, if the substituents are different on each end, the trans configuration would lead to a chiral molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not chiral regardless of configuration.

I think I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the options.

If we accept that options 1 and 2 are correct, then option D is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure about option 1.

Alternatively, perhaps only option 2 is correct. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that options 1 and 2 are correct, making option D the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images.

### Analysis of Each Moiety:

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The arrangement of these substituents could potentially lack a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. However, due to the symmetrical positions of the substituents (2 and 6 being across from each other on each ring), the molecule likely has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   This molecule, also known as the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid), has a chiral center at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group, the carboxylate group, and two different substituents (a methyl group and a hydrogen atom). This chiral center makes the molecule non-superimposable with its mirror image, leading to optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone consists of two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. The structure is highly symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl carbon. This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid. The structure is (E)-MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. In the trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Moiety 1: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (likely achiral due to symmetry).  
- Moiety 2: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).  
- Moiety 3: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (symmetrical).  
- Moiety 4: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  

From the given options, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (moiety 2)** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly include only moiety 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **D) 1 and 2**, assuming a potential error in the evaluation of moiety 1.

Answer: D
