Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constants. Let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I should recall the definitions. The mass dimension of an operator is found by considering the dimensions of each field involved. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling constant's mass dimension must be greater than or equal to zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in four-dimensional spacetime (which I think is the default unless stated otherwise), a term is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤ 4. Because the action has to be dimensionless in four dimensions, right? Because the action is the integral of the Lagrangian, which has dimensions of [Mass]^4 in four dimensions, so the Lagrangian density must have dimension [Mass]^4.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Because when you integrate it over d^4 x, which is [Mass]^−4, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each field in the term contributes their own dimensions, and the coupling constant's dimension is adjusted so that the entire term has dimension 4.

So for the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I need to find the mass dimension of each field.

I remember that in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and m (mass) has dimension 1. So each ψ must have dimension 3/2 because when you have ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, the term must match dimension. Let's see: ψ̄ (3/2) * γ^μ (dimensionless) * ∂_μ (1) * ψ (3/2). Adding up: 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 4. Yes, that makes sense. So ψ has dimension 3/2.

What about the field strength tensor F^{μν}? I think F is a field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1. The field strength is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu, so each F has the same dimension as A_mu. So F^{μν} has dimension 1.

Wait, wait, no. Because when you have A_mu, which is a vector potential, its dimension is 1. So F^{mu nu} is the derivative of A, which is [A][mu] dimension is [mass]^1. So the derivative ∂ is [mass]^1. So F has dimension [∂A] which is 1 + 1 = 2. Oh wait, that's right. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term is ∂ (mass^1) acting on A (mass^1), so F has dimension 2.

So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Now, the sigma matrix σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless as it's constructed from the products of gammas and the structure is commutators. So σ doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

Now, let me write the term in the Lagrangian: κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

The dimensions of each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, and F has 2. So putting it all together:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3/2 +3/2=3) + 2 = [κ] +5.

The entire term must have dimension 4, because it's part of the Lagrangian. So:

[κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = 4-5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, for renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because in four dimensions, any term with a coupling of negative mass dimension would require an infinite number of terms (nonrenormalizable), since higher-order terms would have lower mass dimension, leading to higher divergences.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the condition for a theory to be renormalizable is that the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions in the term). Alternatively, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things.

Wait, the renormalizability is about whether the interaction term is of renormalizable type. In four dimensions, a term is renormalizable only if its mass dimension (as part of the Lagrangian) is ≤4. Wait, no, no: each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over d^4 x, which is dimension [Mass]^−4, so each Lagrangian term must have [Mass]^4.

Wait, no, wait again. The Lagrangian density has dimension 4 (mass^4) because ∫ L d^4x must be dimensionless (since it's the action). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term L_int is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

We computed that [κ] = -1. So the term has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = -1 +3/2 +3/2 + 2 = (-1) +3 + 2 = 4. So that's correct.

But for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because in the counterterms, if the coupling has negative mass dimension, the higher-order terms would have higher dimensions, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

Ah, right. So the dimension of the coupling should be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because in the counterterms, if the coupling has a negative dimension, you'd end up needing an infinite number of terms.

In our case, [κ] is -1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So combining the two parts: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable → no.

Option B: [κ]=1, which would be if perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, why would [κ] be 1? Let me double-check.

Wait, I'll recompute [κ]. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ has 3/2, F has 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) =3. Multiply by F: 3+2=5. So the term κ * (5) must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1. Correct.

Therefore, the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $3/2$ in four spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, is dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because it is part of the Lagrangian density, which has mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the dimensions:
- $\bar{\psi}$ has dimension $3/2$.
- $\psi$ has dimension $3/2$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Thus, the total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Setting this equal to $4$ gives:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension $\geq 0$. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is less than $0$. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect** because the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect** because $[\kappa]$ is not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect** because $[\kappa]$ is not $1$.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Answer: C**
