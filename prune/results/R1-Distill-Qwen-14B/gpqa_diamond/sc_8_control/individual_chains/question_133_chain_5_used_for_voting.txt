Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. So, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? 

The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both have their molecular weights given. 

Wait, so I think this is a buffer solution problem. Because KH2PO4 is a weak acid (since it's H3PO4-related) and Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base. So they're probably mixing a weak acid and its conjugate base, making a buffer.

Right, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes into play here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, since I'm asked about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base, I need to figure out how much each salt contributes to the concentrations of HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which can act as an acid). Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (which can act as a base, since it can accept a proton to become PO4^3-). So the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So in solution, the species present are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). The H2PO4^- can donate a proton (so it's an acid), and HPO4^2- can accept a proton (so it's a base).

Now, when these two are in solution, they will form a buffer. The relevant Ka here is Ka2 of H3PO4 because H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+. The Ka for this is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, right! Because when HPO4^2- accepts a proton, it becomes PO4^3-. But in this solution, HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with PO4^3- and H+. So the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. Because the reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. But wait, that's the third dissociation, so the Ka3 is for that. So the HPO4^2- can further lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because Ka3 is much smaller than Ka2. Oh, but in a buffer solution, the dominant species are the ones from the two salts. So the PO4^3- concentration is going to be determined by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-. 

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let me calculate the moles of each component first.

For KH2PO4 (Mw 136.09 g/mol), 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol is approximately 0.007335 mol. Since KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-, the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007335 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O (Mw 177.99 g/mol), 1.00 g divided by 177.99 g/mol is about 0.005614 mol. This gives moles of HPO4^2- as 0.005614 mol.

So the concentrations in the solution (volume 0.2 L) are [H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M, and [HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

But wait, the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH can be calculated using Ka2, because that's the dissociation between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 0.792 -8 = -7.208, so pKa2 is 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02807 / 0.036675).

Calculating the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765. Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation of H3PO4.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M, [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.20e-8 M.

So rearranging, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging the numbers in: (1.8e-12) * (0.02807) / (8.20e-8)

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Then, divide by 8.20e-8: 5.0526e-14 / 8.20e-8 = approx 6.16e-7.

Wait, that's about 6.16e-7 M. But looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, and option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 10^-7.093. Let me calculate that precisely.

10^-7.093 = 10^(-7 -0.093) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.093.

10^-0.093 is approximately 0.83 (since 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794, but 0.093 is a bit less). Let me compute it more accurately.

Using log tables or calculator steps: ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.214, so e^0.214 is approx 1.238, so 10^0.093 ≈ 1.238. So 10^-0.093 ≈ 1/1.238 ≈ 0.807.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.807 ≈ 8.07e-8 M.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used 8.20e-8, but perhaps the more precise value is 8.07e-8.

So back to [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) = approx 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.07e-8: 5.0526e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0526 /8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.07 ≈ 0.626. So 0.626e-6 is 6.26e-7 M.

So about 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's very close.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there another consideration? Because the HPO4^2- can also react as a base with water, but the main source of PO4^3- is from the further deprotonation. So our approach seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression. Let me write the equation again:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Yes, so plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

[H+] is 10^-7.093 = 8.07e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.07e-8) 

Calculating numerator: 1.8 * 0.02807 = 0.050526, then multiplied by 1e-12 gives 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0526 /8.07 ) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.07 ≈ 0.626 → 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.26e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. So I think the correct answer is A.

But wait, let me check the calculations again because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007335 mol → 0.036675 M H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol → 0.02807 M HPO4^2-.

Yes.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02807 /0.036675 = approx 0.765.

Log(0.765) is about -0.113.

So pH = 7.208 -0.113 =7.095 → [H+] = 10^-7.095 ≈ 8.02e-8.

Hmm, maybe I should compute [H+] more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach for pH.

Let me compute the log(0.02807/0.036675).

0.02807 /0.036675 = (approx 0.02807 ÷ 0.036675) → let's compute that.

0.02807 ÷ 0.036675.

Let me compute 0.02807 / 0.036675 → 2807 / 3667.5 → approx 0.765.

Yes, so log(0.765) → let's compute it more precisely.

Log(0.765) can be found using log(7.65 x10^-1) → log(7.65) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116 → log(0.765) ≈ -0.1158.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.1158 = 7.0922.

So [H+] = 10^-7.0922.

Calculating 10^-7.0922:

10^(-7) = 1e-7. 10^(-0.0922) → let's compute.

0.0922 in log terms.

We know that 10^0.0922 = approx 1.239, so 10^-0.0922 = 1/1.239 ≈ 0.806.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.806 = 8.06e-8.

Now, back to [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.06e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.06e-8 → 5.0526e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.0526 /8.06 ) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.06 ≈ 0.627 → 0.627e-6 = 6.27e-7 M.

But the options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So 6.27e-7 is very close to option A. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: Are we considering the dilution correctly?

Yes, 200 mL is 0.2 L, so concentrations are moles divided by 0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- which is in equilibrium with H+ and PO4^3-.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02807 M. Using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

Which is exactly what I've done.

So yes, the calculation is correct, and the answer should be around 6.24e-7, which is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation of KH₂PO₄ produces H₂PO₄⁻, and the dissociation of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O produces HPO₄²⁻. These species form a buffer with the relevant equilibrium governed by the second dissociation constant, \( K_a2 \), of H₃PO₄.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The buffer system involves \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base). The relevant \( K_a \) is \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02807}{0.036675}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Relating \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \) to \( K_a3 \)
The concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is determined by the third dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The equilibrium constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The expression for \( K_a3 \) is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO}_4^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
From the calculated pH, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \). Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

Answer: A
