Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a state to its lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is approximately on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So, the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/(2π), or sometimes they approximate it as ħ. But wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but for order of magnitude calculations, people often just use ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So, if the lifetime is the time uncertainty, then the energy uncertainty would be ħ divided by the lifetime.

Wait, but the lifetimes given are the proper lifetimes of each state. So, for each state, the energy uncertainty is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Since τ1 is 1e-9 seconds and τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, τ2 is ten times longer than τ1. So, ΔE2 would be smaller than ΔE1 because a longer lifetime implies a narrower energy spread.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, not the energy uncertainty. Wait, wait. The question is about the energy difference, ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve these two states, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty so that they don't overlap.

Wait, no. I think the idea is that when you have two states with finite lifetimes (each with their own energy uncertainty), the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolved. Because if the energy difference is smaller, their energy levels might overlap due to their uncertainties.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. When you have two levels, each with their own energy uncertainty, the minimum separation between their centers (E2 - E1) should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties to clearly distinguish them. Or is it the product?

Alternatively, maybe it's the uncertainty principle applied to the measurement. The energy resolution (ΔE) needed to distinguish two states is determined by the time over which you can measure. Wait, but in this case, each state has its own lifetime.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. The energy resolution required to distinguish two levels depends on the time you observe them. The longer the time, the better the energy resolution (since ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt).

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So, when you measure the energy of each state, the uncertainty in each is determined by their own lifetimes.

But how does that help in distinguishing E1 and E2?

Wait, perhaps we need the energy difference between E1 and E2 to be much larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

So the condition would be (E2 - E1) > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy has an uncertainty, so the separation must be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties. So, let's compute the uncertainties for each.

The uncertainty principle is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2. Let me take ħ as approximately 1e-34 J·s.

So, for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1e-34) / (1e-9) = 1e-25 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 1e-25 J is (1e-25)/(1.6e-19) ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

Wait, that seems way too small. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should recompute. Let me see: ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s. Oh right! Because ħ in J·s is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and converting to eV·s using 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. That's a handy number to remember for these kinds of calculations.

So, using ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, the uncertainty in energy for E1 is ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = (6.582e-16)/(1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for E1 and E2, respectively.

Now, to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.

So, sum of uncertainties is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7.24e-7, so not good.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller, no way.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e+3 times larger than 7.24e-7. So that's way bigger, which satisfies the condition.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is about 1.38e-1 times 7.24e-7, but wait, 7.24e-7 is about 7.24e-7 = 7.24 * 1e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 0.01 * 1e-7, so 7.24e-7 is 724 times larger than 1e-8. So 1e-8 is much smaller than 7.24e-7. So D is 1e-8, which is way too small.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is much larger than 7.24e-7, so it's well above the required threshold.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way to think about it is, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's the sum of the two uncertainties or the maximum uncertainty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the precision of the measurement, which is based on the lifetime of each state. But I think the approach where the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties makes more sense. Because each state has its own uncertainty, so the two energy levels' ranges (E ± ΔE) should not overlap.

So, the minimum energy difference is the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, in that case, the correct answer is option C, since 1e-4 eV is the only option larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), the energy uncertainties for the two states are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it does not satisfy the condition.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also does not satisfy the condition.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it does not satisfy the condition.

The only option that meets the requirement is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
