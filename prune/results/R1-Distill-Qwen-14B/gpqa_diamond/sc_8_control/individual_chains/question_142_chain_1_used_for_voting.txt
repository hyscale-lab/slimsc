Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh right, this looks like a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because the coefficients are both 1/2, it's like a completely mixed state for a qubit. So this is the maximally mixed state, right?

Wait, what's the density matrix for a pure state versus a mixed state? For a pure state, ρ would be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its trace would be 1. But for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so ρ would be a convex combination of projectors. So in this case, since it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, it's a mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, I is the identity matrix, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) that determines the point on the Bloch sphere. The magnitude of r must be ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

So let's write out the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out these projectors in matrix form.

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, we get ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Wait, but the standard form for ρ is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute that. The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So (I + r·σ)/2 would be (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] + (1/2)(r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]). Let me compute this.

The identity part is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. The σ_x term is [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]]. The σ_y term is [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]]. The σ_z term is [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]].

Adding all these components together, the diagonal elements are (1/2 + r_z/2) and (1/2 - r_z/2). The off-diagonal elements (top right and bottom left) are (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) and (r_x/2 + i r_y/2), respectively.

But our given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. So let's set the off-diagonal elements to zero. That means r_x/2 - i r_y/2 = 0. So both real and imaginary parts must be zero. Real part: r_x/2 = 0 → r_x = 0. Imaginary part: -r_y/2 = 0 → r_y = 0.

Now, the diagonal elements must match. For the (1,1) element: 1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2. That implies r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is 1/2 - r_z/2 = 1/2 → r_z = 0.

Wait, but then r would be (0,0,0). Oh, that's interesting. So the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. Because r is (0,0,0), the point is at the origin.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0⟩⟨0| if the z-component is 1, but wait, |0⟩⟨0| would have r_z = 1 because the density matrix would be (I + σ_z)/2. But our case is a mixture, so the vector is at the origin.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me double-check. If r is (0,0,0), then ρ is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches exactly what's given. Yep, that's correct.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The density matrix can be expressed in the Bloch sphere representation as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. The magnitude of \( \mathbf{r} \) must satisfy \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \) to ensure the density matrix is positive semi-definite.

For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal elements are zero, and the diagonal elements are both \( \frac{1}{2} \). Comparing this to the general form of \( \rho \), the off-diagonal terms imply \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms imply \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct choice is 

\[
\text{C) } r = (0, 0, 0).
\]
