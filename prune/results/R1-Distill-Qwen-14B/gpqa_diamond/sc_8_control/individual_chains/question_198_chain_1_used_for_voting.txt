Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. I remember that this involves stability constants and maybe some equilibrium expressions. Let me think step by step.

So, the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, wait, the options are given, but not sure yet.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the complexes right. Cobalt can form various thiocyanate complexes. I think the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or wait, maybe I have that wrong. Let me see: each SCN- contributes a charge of -1. So for Co^2+, adding n SCN- would make the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n).

So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+, charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because 2*(-1) + 2+ =0. Hmm, but wait, stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the formation of the complex with n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the stability constant β is defined as the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+). So for β1, the complex is [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constant β for a complex [ML_n] is given by β = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So for each step, each additional ligand added multiplies the β for that step.

Wait, but I think the overall formation can be considered as a stepwise or an overall process. Oh right, the stability constants are for each step. So the overall formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would involve multiple β's. So the overall β for n=1 is β1=9. For n=2, it's β1*β2=9*40=360. For n=3, β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680. For n=4, β1*β2*β3*β4= 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, formed by adding another SCN- to the first complex. The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the stability constants given are the stepwise ones. So for the first complex, β1=9, for the second β2=40 (so to go from [Co(SCN)]^+ to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, you multiply by β2), etc.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), but wait no. Wait, another thing: the color of the complexes. Cobalt complexes with different numbers of SCN- can have different colors. I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). Hmm, I'm not certain about the color, but perhaps the question specifies it's the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co^2+.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or wait, Co^2+ plus two SCN- would be neutral: [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But wait, the problem states the complexes as [Co(SCN)_n], but the charge depends on n. So for dithiocyanato, n=2.

Wait another thought: Maybe the blue complex is the tetrathiocyanate, like [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or perhaps the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is blue? I'm not entirely certain, but maybe I can proceed without knowing the exact complex, as the question gives the stability constants.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex. Wait, but how would that work? Let me think: Co^2+ plus two SCN- would be Co(SCN)_2^(0), because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the charge would be neutral. Alternatively, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would require it to have a charge of +2. That would mean two SCN- and Co^2+ gives a complex charge of +2? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex is neutral. So [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral.

Wait, perhaps I got the naming wrong. Dithiocyanato could imply di as in two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the question is about the percentage of this species in the solution.

So, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all Co species.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) =1e-2 M. That's the sum of all Co species: free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So, the approach is to calculate the distribution of each species, which depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

The formula for each species is given by the product of the stability constants up to that point, multiplied by the concentration of Co^2+ and the appropriate power of SCN^- concentration.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k=0 to 4 of (β1β2...βk [Co^2+][SCN^-]^k ) )

Wait, wait. Let's make it precise. The fraction of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ) / K_total

Where K_total is the sum over all possible n (from 0 to 4) of (β1β2...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

Wait, but wait, [Co^2+] is part of each term. So if I factor that out, the fractions become:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum from k=0 to 4 (β1β2...βk [SCN^-]^k ) )

Because all terms have [Co^2+], which cancels when taking the ratio.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is actually the total concentration of Co, which is the sum of all the species. Hmm, no, wait. [Co^2+] is the free ion, but in the expressions for each complex, the [Co^2+] is multiplied by [SCN^-]^n and the product of β's gives the concentration of the complex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the distribution using the formation constants. Let me think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step.

Each complex is formed by adding SCN- to the previous complex. So the concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] [SCN^-]

But this is a stepwise approach, and might be more complicated. Alternatively, the overall formation constants can be considered as the product of the stepwise β values up to that point.

Let me compute the overall formation constants for each complex.

For n=1: β1 =9. So [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

For n=2: β1 * β2 =9 *40=360. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β1β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

n=3: β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680. [Co(SCN)_3]^- = 22680 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

n=4: β1β2β3β4=22680 *16=362880. [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 362880 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

But since [Co^2+] is a part of each term, when considering the fractions, [Co^2+] will factor out. However, the sum of all species [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is equal to the total Co concentration, c=1e-2 M.

But to find the fraction of each species, perhaps it's better to consider that the fraction f_n is equal to (β1β2...βn [SCN^-]^n ) divided by the sum over all possible n of (β1...βn [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1...βn) [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The free [Co^2+] is c - sum of all complexes. But that complicates things because it's in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation that the free [Co^2+] is much smaller than the total cobalt concentration. But I'm not sure if that's valid here.

Alternatively, we can model the distribution using the formation constants and the given concentrations. Let me consider that the total concentration of Co is c=1e-2 M, and [SCN-]=0.1 M.

Let me denote the concentration of each complex as:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = y

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = z

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = a

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = b

Then:

x + y + z + a + b = c = 1e-2 M

Each of these concentrations can be expressed in terms of x and the stability constants.

For [CoSCN]^+: y = β1 * x [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0: z = β1 β2 * x [SCN^-]^2 = 9*40 x*(0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x

Similarly, a = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 =9*40*63 x*(0.1)^3. Let's compute that: 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680. 22680 * x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

Similarly, b = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 = 362880 x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x.

So now, we can express all in terms of x:

y=0.9x

z=3.6x

a=22.68x

b=36.288x

Then, sum all to c=1e-2:

x + 0.9x + 3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = 1e-2

Let me add them up:

x (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) = 1e-2

Let me compute the sum inside the parenthesis:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So 64.468 x = 1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M

So x ≈ 0.000155 M

Now, the question is the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Let's assume that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is z.

z=3.6x → 3.6 * 1.55e-4 = 5.58e-5 M

The total cobalt is 1e-2 M.

The percentage is (z / c_total) *100 = (5.58e-5 / 1e-2) *100 = 0.558% → Wait, that's way too low. That can't be right. None of the options are that low. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the setup.

Wait, the [Co(SCN)_n] = β1β2...βn * x * [SCN-]^n.

Wait, but the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Let me recompute each term:

y= β1 x [SCN]^1 = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x → correct.

z= β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 =9*40 x*(0.1)^2 =360 x *0.01= 3.6 x → correct.

a= β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 22680 x *0.001=22.68 x → correct.

b= β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4= 9*40*63*16 x*(0.1)^4 = 362880 x *0.0001=36.288 x → correct.

So summing x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) =x * 64.468=1e-2 → x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4.

So z is 3.6 *1.55e-4 =5.58e-5 M.

Total Co is 1e-2 M. So (5.58e-5)/(1e-2) = 0.00558 → 0.558% → approximately 0.56% → but the options are much higher. So something must be wrong.

Ah, wait! Maybe the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but that's the most stable complex. Let me check its percentage.

b=36.288 x → 36.288 *1.55e-4 ≈5.62e-3 M.

So 5.62e-3 /1e-2 =0.562 →56.2%. Hmm, that's higher than the options given. But option A is ~42%, B 25%, C 38%, D 16.9%.

Wait, but where's the mistake? Maybe the question refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} instead of [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, that's not possible because 2+ plus two (-1) gives 0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Maybe the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, but that would require n=2 but with Co^3+ or another oxidation state. Wait, no, the question says Co(II) ions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me re-calculate the sum.

x + y + z + a + b = 1e-2.

With:

x =1.55e-4,

y=0.9x=1.395e-4,

z=3.6x=5.58e-5,

a=22.68x=3.52e-3,

b=36.288x=5.62e-3.

Adding all:

1.55e-4 → 0.000155

y: 0.0001395

z: 0.0000558

a: 0.00352

b: 0.005628

Total: 0.000155+0.0001395=0.0002945

Plus 0.0000558 → 0.0003503

Plus 0.00352 → 0.0038703

Plus 0.005628 → 0.0094983 ≈ 0.0095, but the total should be 0.01.

Hmm, 0.0094983 is about 0.95 of 0.01. So that suggests that x is perhaps a bit higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute the sum correctly:

1.55e-4 → 0.000155

0.9x is 0.9 * 1.55e-4 = 1.395e-4 → 0.0001395

3.6x → 3.6 * 1.55e-4=5.58e-5 →0.0000558

22.68x →22.68 *1.55e-4=3.5202e-3 →0.0035202

36.288x →36.288 *1.55e-4=5.62704e-3 →0.00562704

Now sum these:

0.000155 +0.0001395 = 0.0002945

+0.0000558 →0.0003503

+0.0035202 → 0.0038705

+0.00562704 →0.00949754

That's approximately 0.00949754, which is about 0.949754e-2, but the total should be 1e-2. So there's a discrepancy of about (1e-2 - 9.49754e-3) =5.0246e-5. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust x to account for that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately. Let me consider that the free [Co^2+] is x, then express each complex in terms of x and the given β's. Then the sum of all species equals the total Co concentration.

So, the correct approach is to write each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of x and then sum all:

x + (β1 x [SCN]) + (β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 ) + (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 ) = c.

So, the equation is:

x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c

So, x = c / [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute each term:

Term for n=0: 1 (free Co^2+)

n=1: β1 [SCN] = 9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288

So the sum inside the brackets is:

1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468.

So x= c / 64.468 → c=1e-2 → x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

So, same x as before.

Now, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]/c.

So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0: z=3.6 x → 3.6 *1.55e-4=5.58e-5.

So fraction is 5.58e-5 /1e-2 = 0.00558 → 0.558% → but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the fractions. Wait, let me compute the fractions correctly.

The fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total.

So, for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = β1...βn x [SCN]^n.

But x =c / ( sum terms ), which is 1e-2 /64.468.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β1...βn * (c / sum) * [SCN]^n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n]/c = (β1...βn [SCN]^n ) / sum_terms.

So the fraction is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / sum_terms.

Let me compute this for each n.

sum_terms is 64.468.

n=0: 1 → 1/64.468≈0.0155 → 1.55%

n=1: 0.9 →0.9/64.468→≈0.014 →1.4%

n=2:3.6 →3.6/64.468≈0.0558 →5.58%

n=3:22.68 →22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%

n=4:36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5628 →56.28%

So, the fractions are approximately:

n=0: 1.55%

n=1:1.4%

n=2:5.58%

n=3:35.2%

n=4:56.28%

Wait, adding these up: 1.55 +1.4=2.95, +5.58=8.53, +35.2=43.73, +56.28=100.01. So that's about right.

So, the percentage for n=2 is about 5.58%, which is way lower than the options given (the lowest option is D) 16.9%). So this suggests that I must have made a mistake in identifying which complex corresponds to which n.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- per Co^2+. So perhaps n=2, which we calculated as ~5.58%, but that's not matching the options. So perhaps the problem is about a different n. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I defined the complexes. Maybe the blue complex is the fourth one, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

That's about 56.28%, which is close to option A (42.3%) but higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [SCN-] term.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the [SCN-] used in the calculations. The [SCN-] is given as 0.1 M. But is that the total [SCN-] or the free [SCN-]?

Hmm, in the problem statement, [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But in reality, when Co complexes form, the free [SCN-] would decrease. However, the problem gives [SCN-] as 0.1 M, which suggests that it's in excess, so that the free [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 M. So, I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the stability constants. Let me think again. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16, which is less than β3 and β2. That might imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which might not make sense. Hmm, but the problem states the stability constants, so I have to work with them.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the blue [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Which in our calculation is about 56%, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum inside the fraction. Let me re-calculate the fractions correctly.

Wait, the fractions are:

n=0: 1 /64.468 →~0.0155 → 1.55%

n=1: 0.9 /64.468 → approx 0.014 →1.4%

n=2:3.6 /64.468 → approx 0.0558 →5.58%

n=3:22.68 /64.468 → approx 0.352 →35.2%

n=4:36.288 /64.468 →~0.5628 →56.28%

So, the sum is correct. So according to this, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is about 56%, which is not an option.

Wait, the options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is option C)38.1%, which is close to our n=3 fraction of 35.2%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum inside the denominator.

sum_terms =1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4.

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1)=9 * 0.1=0.9 → term=0.9

β1β2*(0.1)^2=9*40 *0.01= 360*0.01=3.6 → term=3.6

β1β2β3*(0.1)^3=9*40*63 *0.001= 22680 *0.001=22.68 → term=22.68

β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001= 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → term=36.288

So sum=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468 → correct.

Hmm. So according to this, the percentages are as I calculated. So the percentages for each complex are:

n=4:56.28%

n=3:35.2%

n=2:5.58%

n=1:1.4%

n=0:1.55%

But the options don't include 56% or 35%, but option C is 38.1%, which is close to n=3's 35.2%. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the order of the stability constants. Wait, the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for the formation of [CoSCN]^+, the β is 9. To form the next complex, you multiply by β2=40, etc.

But perhaps the problem refers to the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^− or another charge state. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- and I'm being asked about that, but why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps I have miscalculated the fractions. Wait, perhaps the fraction is not [Co(SCN)_n]/c, but the sum of all species includes [Co^2+] and the complexes. But the way I set up the fractions, each [Co(SCN)_n] is [Co(SCN)_n]/c, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_4], but that doesn't make sense as the question asks about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is a single complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recompute the fractions.

Wait, let me compute each fraction precisely.

For n=2:

fraction = (β1β2 [SCN]^2) / sum_terms → (9*40*(0.1)^2 ) /64.468 → (360 * 0.01 ) /64.468 →3.6 /64.468 → approx 0.05565 →5.565%.

For n=3:

(9*40*63*(0.1)^3 ) → 22680 *0.001=22.68 → 22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

For n=4:

9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 →362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5628 →56.28%.

Hmm, none of these match the options. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding of which complex is the dithiocyanato.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, that would imply the charge is 2+ + 2*(-1) =0. No, that's the same as [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^- with three SCN-? No, that would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex as the blue one. So according to our calculation, it's 56.28%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the first complex [CoSCN]^+ as the blue one. But that would be 1.4%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of [CoSCN]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is being considered. But that would be 1.4% +5.58% =6.98%, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of all possible complexes except the free Co^2+? But that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formation of the complex goes up to n=3 or n=4, but perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of the β product.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum:

Compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9*0.1=0.9 → sum so far 1.9

n=2: β1β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6 → sum 5.5

n=3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 28.18

n=4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288 → sum 64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck because the calculated percentages don't match any of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complex, not stepwise. So for [Co(SCN)_n], βn is the overall stability constant, not stepwise. Oh! That's a possibility I hadn't considered. Because sometimes, in problems, the given β could be for the overall complex, not the stepwise addition.

If that's the case, then the way I used the β's would be incorrect. Let me think.

If β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc., then the calculation would be different.

So, for example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have a β of β2=40, and not β1*β2=360.

In that case, the calculation changes.

So, let me re-calculate assuming that the β's are overall stability constants.

In that case, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN] → same as before.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4.

So, the sum would be:

x + β1 x [SCN] + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4 = c.

So, substituting the values:

x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ) = c.

So, x= c / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Let me compute each term:

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum these terms:

1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So x= c /2.3646 =1e-2 /2.3646≈4.227e-3 M.

Now, the fractions:

Each [Co(SCN)_n] is βn [SCN]^n x.

So,

[Co^2+]=x=4.227e-3.

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] =9 *4.227e-3 *0.1 = 0.03804e-3 =3.804e-5.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =40 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.227e-3 *0.01= 40 *4.227e-5= 1.6908e-3.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =63 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^3=63 *4.227e-3 *0.001=63 *4.227e-6≈2.662e-4.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =16 *4.227e-3 * (0.1)^4=16 *4.227e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.227e-7≈6.763e-6.

Now, compute the fractions:

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

The fractions are each [Co(SCN)_n]/c.

So,

[Co^2+] fraction:4.227e-3 /1e-2=0.4227 →42.27%.

[CoSCN]^+:3.804e-5 /1e-2=0.003804 →0.38%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0:1.6908e-3 /1e-2=0.16908 →16.908%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^-:2.662e-4 /1e-2=0.02662 →2.66%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2-:6.763e-6 /1e-2=0.0006763 →0.0676%.

So the percentages are approximately:

Co^2+:42.27%

CoSCN^+:0.38%

Co(SCN)_2^0:16.908%

Co(SCN)_3^-:2.66%

Co(SCN)_4^2-:0.0676%

So, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which we've been assuming is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. That's 16.908%, which is option D (16.9%).

But wait, the question says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- per Co^2+, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that would be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, according to this calculation, the most abundant species is Co^2+ at 42%, which is option A (42.3%), very close. So the question is about which percentage to choose.

Wait, the initial assumption that the β's are stepwise may be incorrect. If the given β's are overall, then the calculation leads to [Co(SCN)_2]^0 being 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when I assumed the β's were stepwise, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 was 5.58%, which didn't match any options. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the β's as overall constants.

But how can I tell from the problem statement whether the β's are stepwise or overall?

The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants are generally given as overall constants, not stepwise. Wait, no, that's a point of confusion. Sometimes, they are given as cumulative (overall) constants, sometimes as stepwise. So, when β is given for [Co(SCN)_n], it's the overall constant for forming that complex from the previous one.

Wait, let me think again. Stepwise and overall stability constants are different. The stepwise β is for adding one ligand at a time, while the overall βn is for the complex with n ligands.

In this problem, the β's are given as the stability constants for each complex, meaning β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So in this case, the approach should be to use them as overall, not stepwise. Because the stepwise β's are the ones for each addition, but the given β's are for the complexes.

So, in that case, the correct approach is the second one, where each β is for the respective n, not the product of β1 to βn. Therefore, the fractions would be:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

So, the earlier calculation with the second approach, where the sum is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646, and x=4.227e-3.

In that case, the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the other approach, considering the stepwise β's, which leads to 5.58% for [Co(SCN)_2], but that's not an option.

So the correct approach is to use the β's as overall stability constants, leading to [Co(SCN)_2]^0 being 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So they're given as the stepwise constants, because the stepwise constants are for each addition. So, for the first complex, β1=9; for the second, β2=40, etc. So the correct approach is the first one, where each β is stepwise.

But in that case, none of the options match, unless I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the stepwise and overall stability constants. Let me look for a way to resolve this.

The overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise β's up to n. So, if β1, β2, etc., are stepwise, then the overall βn is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

In our first approach, we used the stepwise β's and calculated the overall β's, leading to the fractions we got earlier.

But perhaps in the problem, the given β's are the overall stability constants. For example, β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. In that case, the second approach is correct.

But how to decide which interpretation is correct? The problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

In chemistry, the stability constant (β) for a complex is usually the overall constant, not the stepwise. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have a β of β2=40, not the product of β1 and β2.

So perhaps the second approach is correct, leading to [Co(SCN)_2]^0 being 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back, when we used the stepwise β's, the result didn't match any options. So the correct approach must be the second one, considering the given β's as overall.

Thus, the correct answer would be option D, 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

### Approach:
The stability constants provided are interpreted as **overall stability constants** for the respective complexes:
- \( \beta_1 \): Stability constant for \([CoSCN]^+\),
- \( \beta_2 \): Stability constant for \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\),
- \( \beta_3 \): Stability constant for \([Co(SCN)_3]^- \),
- \( \beta_4 \): Stability constant for \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\).

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

The concentration of each complex is proportional to:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]

The fraction of each species is given by:
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

### Calculations:
1. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. Compute the fraction of \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\):
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{2.3646}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

3. Convert to percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
