Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their lambda_max is the same, that suggests their temperatures are the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T must be the same. Because b is a constant. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So yes, we can apply Wien's law here. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

So, for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4.
For Star_2, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4.

Since T is the same for both, L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²).

Wait, the problem says R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5. Therefore, (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1/L2 should be 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is 2.25.

But wait, wait a second. The problem includes some other information: radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, does that affect the calculation of luminosity? Because the luminosity calculation using L = 4π R² σ T^4 is based on the star's intrinsic properties, not its motion through space. The radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but since the peak wavelengths are given as the same, that's already accounted for in the temperature being the same.

Wait, but let's think again. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect. The star moving towards us would have a blueshift, away would be redshift. But in this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift needs to be considered in determining their actual temperatures.

Wait, no, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same." So the observed lambda_max is the same. But the actual lambda_max for each star would be based on their rest frame temperatures.

Let me clarify. Let's say Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Its light would be redshifted. So the observed lambda_max would be longer than its rest frame lambda_max. Conversely, Star_1 is stationary, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its rest frame.

If the observed lambda_max of both stars is the same, then the rest frame lambda_max must differ. So T1 and T2 are different. Wait, this complicates things.

Hmm, earlier I thought the temperatures were the same because observed lambda_max is same. But if one star is moving, the observed lambda is different from the rest frame.

Wait, let's clarify. Wien's law says lambda_max = b / T in the rest frame. But when a star is moving, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (v_r positive for moving away, negative for moving towards).

So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. Since the problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s, but it doesn't specify direction. But in any case, the formula would apply. Let's assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive.

So lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r / c).

But the problem states that both observed lambda_max are the same. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So, lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c).

But lambda1_rest = b / T1, and lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting, b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2_r / c).

We can cancel b from both sides: 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2_r / c).

Rearranging: T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r / c).

So T1 is less than T2 because denominator is greater than 1.

Wait, because if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying that the star is cooler. So in this case, the observed lambda_max is same, but Star_2 is moving away. So its rest frame lambda_max must be smaller, which means T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. The observed lambda_max for Star_2 is longer. But the problem says that Star_1's observed lambda_max is same as Star_2's. So Star_2's observed lambda_max is longer than it would be at rest. Therefore, the rest frame lambda_max for Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1.

Wait, because when Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda is longer than its rest frame. So if the observed lambda for Star_2 is same as Star_1's, which is stationary, then lambda2_rest must be (lambda_obs) / (1 + v_r/c). Because lambda_obs is lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r/c). So lambda2_rest = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r/c).

But Star_1's lambda_rest is just lambda_obs, because v_r is zero. So lambda2_rest = lambda_obs * (1/(1 + v_r/c)).

But since lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature, T2 = b / lambda2_rest = b * (1 + v_r/c) / lambda_obs.

And T1 = b / lambda_obs.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, that seems correct. Because T2 = b / lambda2_rest.

So, T2 = b / (lambda_obs / (1 + v_r/c)) ) = b (1 + v_r/c) / lambda_obs.

But T1 is b / lambda_obs.

So T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, but then that would imply that T2 is higher than T1, which makes sense because Star_2 is moving away, so we see it as cooler, but the observed lambda is same as Star_1, which is at higher T.

Wait, it's getting a bit complicated. Let me write down the equations.

Given:

lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest = b / T1.

lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c ) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r/c).

But the problem states lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2_r / c )

Because (1/(1/T2)) = T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, no, let's see:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r/c.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

So T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer. So if both have same observed lambda_max, then Star_2 must have a shorter lambda_rest, which implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1.

So now, when calculating luminosity, it's L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1 = 4pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

The question says, compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. So L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5 => (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c). V_r is 700 km/s.

Wait, what is v_r? Because it's a radial velocity. Let me compute v_r / c.

v_r = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

v_r/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) = 0.023333...

So (1 + v_r/c) = 1.023333...

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333...

So T2 / T1 = 1.023333...

T2^4 / T1^4 = (1.023333...)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me approximate (1.02333)^4.

First, compute ln(1.02333) = approx 0.023.

So ln(1.02333)^4 = 4 * 0.023 = 0.092.

e^0.092 ≈ 1.096. So T2^4 / T1^4 ≈ 1.096.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

1.023333 is 1 + 7/300 = 1 + 0.023333.

Calculating (1.023333)^4:

Let me compute step by step.

First, 1.023333 squared.

1.023333^2 = (approx) 1.023333 * 1.023333.

1.023333 * 1.023333 ≈ 1.0473 (since 0.023333^2 is about 0.000544, and 2*1.023333 *0.023333 is about 0.048, so total 1.048544, but maybe more precise.)

Wait, let's do it more accurately.

1.023333 × 1.023333:

= (1 + 0.023333)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2

= 1 + 0.046666 + (0.000544444)

≈ 1.04721.

Now, square that to get the 4th power.

(1.04721)^2:

= (1 + 0.04721)^2

= 1 + 2*0.04721 + (0.04721)^2

= 1 + 0.09442 + 0.002229 ≈ 1.09665.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ approximately 1.09665.

So T2^4 = (T1 * 1.023333)^4 = T1^4 * 1.09665.

So, T2^4 / T1^4 = 1.09665.

So now, L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1 / 1.09665 )

= 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 divided by 1.09665.

Let's compute this.

1.09665 × 2.05 ≈ 2.246.

Wait, 1.09665 × 2.05 = ?

1.09665 * 2 = 2.1933

1.09665 * 0.05 = 0.0548325

Total ≈ 2.1933 + 0.0548325 = 2.24813.

Which is about 2.248, which is very close to 2.25.

Wait, wait, but 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ ?

Let me compute it as 2.25 / 1.09665.

Let me approximate 1.09665 as approximately 1.09665.

So 2.25 ÷ 1.09665.

Let me compute 1.09665 times 2 is 2.1933. So 2.25 is 0.0567 more than 2.1933.

So 0.0567 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.0517.

So the total is approximately 2 + 0.0517 ≈ 2.0517.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 2.25 / 1.09665.

Alternatively, let me compute 1.09665 × 2.05 = 2.05 ×1.09665.

1.05 * 1.09665 ≈ 1.15148.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.25 ÷ 1.09665.

Let me do long division.

1.09665 ) 2.25

Wait, 1.09665 × 2 = 2.1933.

Subtract that from 2.25: 2.25 - 2.1933 = 0.0567.

Bring down a zero: 0.0567 becomes 0.05670.

Now, 1.09665 × 0.052 ≈ 0.05686.

So 0.052 is the next digit.

So 2.052 as an approximate quotient.

So 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ approximately 2.052.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.09665) ≈ 2.052.

Wait, but wait, no, the formula is:

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * (1/(1.09665)).

Which is 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.052.

But wait, wait. Let me compute this again.

Wait, wait, no. Because (T1^4 / T2^4) is (1/(1.09665)).

So 2.25 * (1/1.09665) = 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ ?

Because 1/1.09665 ≈ 0.9118.

So 2.25 × 0.9118 ≈ 2.25 ×0.9 = 2.025, plus 2.25 ×0.0118 ≈ 0.0263. So about 2.051.

So approximately 2.05.

But wait, the options given are around 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Wait, none of the options are 2.05. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, the problem states that the observed lambda_max is the same. So I applied Doppler shift correctly.

But let me think differently. Perhaps I should calculate the ratio of luminosities considering the Doppler effect on the flux.

Wait, another approach: the observed flux from a star depends on its luminosity and distance, but in this problem, perhaps the distance is the same or not? The question says luminosities are computed assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the observed flux is not directly considered, but the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but maybe I need to consider the Doppler shift affecting the observed flux.

Wait, perhaps the observed flux F is L/(4 pi d²), but considering the Doppler shift, the observed flux could be different. Or maybe the observed flux is F = L/(4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r/c)^{-1}.

No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, the observed flux F is the energy per unit area per unit time received from the star. The emitted flux from the star is sigma T^4. But when the star is moving, the observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect.

The formula for the observed flux when a star is moving with radial velocity v_r is F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c)^{-1}.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the flux is proportional to the energy per photon times the number of photons per second.

The energy per photon is E = hc / lambda. Observed lambda is lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

So E_obs = hc / (lambda_rest (1 + v_r/c)) ) = E_rest / (1 + v_r/c).

The number of photons per second as observed would be adjusted by the Doppler shift. The source emits photons at a rate of L/(4 pi R^2 sigma T^4), wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, the flux observed F is given by F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r / c)^{-1}.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux F is F = F0 * (1 + v_r / c ), where F0 is the rest frame flux. Because as a star moves away, it's dimmer, so F decreases by (1 + v_r/c)^{-1}.

Wait, not sure. Let me think in terms of energy received.

Suppose a star emits a certain amount of energy per unit time. When it's moving away, the energy received per unit time (flux) would be less. The Doppler shift affects both the energy of each photon and the rate at which photons arrive.

The energy per photon is E = hc / lambda. For a receding star, lambda increases, so E decreases.

The number of photons per second observed would be lower because the star is moving away, so the photon arrival rate is lower.

Doppler shift changes both the energy per photon and the photon rate. So the observed flux F is F_rest * (1 + v_r/c)^{-1}.

So F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c)^{-1}.

So for Star_1 (v_r=0), F1 = F_rest1.

For Star_2 (v_r=700 km/s), F2 = F_rest2 * (1 + 700/c )^{-1}.

But the problem says that the star's appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, but the brightness in terms of flux would be different.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. That is, the observed lambda_max is same.

But earlier, I thought that implies that their rest frame temperatures are different.

But perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler shift when calculating the luminosity. Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity computed is the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

Wait, the problem says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the computation is based on black body radiation, without considering Doppler shift. Because the luminosity is an intrinsic property, not affected by motion. So perhaps the Doppler shift info is irrelevant for computing luminosity.

But then why was the radial velocity given?

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity. Because if a star is moving away, the flux we receive is lower. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity, which is an intrinsic property, so the Doppler shift should not affect it. Hence, the radial velocity information might be a red herring.

Wait, but the initial part of the problem says that the observed lambda_max are the same. So that suggests that the temperatures are the same, but that's not correct when considering Doppler shift.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

If the observed lambda_max is same, but the star is moving, then their actual temperatures are different.

So, for Star_1, observed lambda_max = lambda1_rest = b/T1.

For Star_2, observed lambda_max = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2_r/c) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c).

So, since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

=> 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2_r/c )

=> T2 = T1 (1 + v2_r/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

Then, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2 = (2.25).

And T2 = T1 (1 + v2_r/c )

=> T2^4 = T1^4 (1 + v2_r/c )^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1 + v2_r/c )^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2_r/c )^4 ]

Now, v2_r is 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

v2_r/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.0023333.

So (1 + v2_r/c ) = 1.0023333.

(1.0023333)^4 is approximately:

Using (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² for small x.

x = 0.0023333.

n=4.

Approximately:

1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)(0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.009333 + (6 * 0.000005444).

= 1 + 0.009333 + 0.000032664.

≈ 1.009365664.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009365664.

So 1/(1.009365664) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Here, \(L\) is proportional to \(R^2 T^4\). The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are equal. Using Wien's law, the rest-frame peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, which is stationary (\(v_r = 0\)), the observed wavelength is the same as the rest-frame wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is redshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging gives:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

The ratio of luminosities is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), we find:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

For the temperature ratio, substituting \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)\) gives:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)^4}
\]

The radial velocity is \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right) \approx 1.002333
\]

Raising this to the fourth power:

\[
\left(1.002333\right)^4 \approx 1.00937
\]

Therefore:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \frac{1}{1.00937} \approx 0.9907
\]

Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

The closest option to this value is **2.23**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
