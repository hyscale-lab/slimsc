Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The question gives us some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method. The given data are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And we're given the Sun's photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Hmm, I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) – log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So each of these abundance ratios is relative to the Sun's ratio.

Let me write down the given abundances in terms of the solar values.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = 0 means that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So, [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) – log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_star1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun.

Since Sun's log(nFe/nH) is -4.5, Star_1's is the same. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) – log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

I can rearrange this to find nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Wait, let's get the Sun's nSi/nFe. Hmm, I don't have that directly. Maybe I can find it using the given Mg/Si and other info.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere data is given for Fe and Mg. So for the Sun, nFe/Sun is 10^-4.5, nMg/Sun is 10^-5. What about nSi/Sun?

I think the solar abundance of Silicon is around 7.57 in terms of log(nSi/nH) +12. Wait, the problem gives us the Sun's nFe and nMg, but not nSi. So perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and then relate the stars' abundances to that.

Wait, maybe I can compute the solar [Mg/Si] and [Si/Fe], using the given Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Wait, but wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero because it's the reference. No, wait, that's not correct. Because [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, [X/Y] is zero for any X and Y because the Sun is the reference. So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = 0, which implies that log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0 → nMg/nSi = 1 in the Sun. So nMg_sun = nSi_sun. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 7, and [Si/H] would be different.

Wait, let me calculate nMg_sun and nFe_sun in terms of H. The Sun's data is 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH,
nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

But what about nSi? I don't have the Sun's [Si/H], but perhaps I can find it through the given data.

Alternatively, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun and [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is zero because for the Sun, [X/Y] measures the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun. So if [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, then nMg/nSi in the Sun is 1. So nMg_sun = nSi_sun.

Wait, but if that's the case, then from the Sun's nMg and nFe, we can relate the abundances.

Wait, let's see. From the Sun:

nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH,
nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH.

And since nMg_sun = nSi_sun, then nSi_sun = 1e-5 * nH.

Wait, is that correct? Because [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → nMg/nSi = nMg_sun /nSi_sun = 1 → nMg_sun = nSi_sun.

So yes, nSi_sun = nMg_sun = 1e-5 nH.

Wait, but that can't be right because I think the Sun has more Si than Mg. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by first computing the abundance ratios for each star in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each star, find nSi, nFe, nMg in terms of nH.

Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → same as Sun.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But nFe_1 = nFe_sun → nFe_1 = nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Hmm, but what is nSi_sun / nFe_sun?

nSi_sun = (some value) based on solar data. Wait, from the Sun's data, nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun,
nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

But earlier, we thought that nMg_sun = nSi_sun, but that would imply nSi_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

Wait, but let's check that again. Because [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → nMg/nSi = nMg_sun /nSi_sun = 1 → nMg_sun = nSi_sun.

So, in the Sun, nSi_sun = nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nSi_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun → which is the same as nMg_sun.

So, nSi_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

Now, for Star_1:

nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → same as Sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but maybe it's better to express everything in terms of H.

So, let's compute the ratios.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe_1 / nH_1) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → let’s denote this as Fe_ratio = Fe_ratio_sun.

So nFe_1 = Fe_ratio_sun * nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1 ) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3 → so nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 = Fe_ratio_sun * nH_1 → so nSi_1 = Fe_ratio_sun * nH_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But we can write nSi_sun in terms of nH_sun.

nSi_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

So nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 → approx 0.316.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (1e-0.5) → 10^0.3 is about 2 → 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

Wait but let me calculate 10^0.3 accurately. 10^0.3 is approximately 2. So 0.3*Log(10) is 0.3, so 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, 10^0.3 ≈ 2 → 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

So nSi_1 = 0.632 * nFe_1.

But nFe_1 is Fe_ratio_sun * nH_1.

Fe_ratio_sun = 1e-4.5 → which is 3.16e-5.

So nFe_1 = 3.16e-5 * nH_1.

Thus, nSi_1 = 0.632 * 3.16e-5 * nH_1 = 0.632 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 2e-5 * nH_1.

Wait, 3.16e-5 * 0.632 ≈ about 1.99e-5 → approx 2e-5.

So nSi_1 ≈ 2e-5 * nH_1.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

Wait, 10^0.3 = e^(0.3 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.3*2.3026) ≈ e^0.6908 ≈ 1.995 → approximately 2.

So yes, 10^0.3 is about 2.

So nSi_1 = 2 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe_1.

Which is 2 * (1e-5 / 1e-4.5) ) * nFe_1.

Wait, 1e-5 / 1e-4.5 = 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316.

So 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

So nSi_1 = 0.632 * nFe_1.

But nFe_1 = 1e-4.5 * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = 0.632 * 1e-4.5 * nH_1.

Which is 6.32e-5 * nH_1.

Alternatively, 1e-4.5 is about 3.16e-5.

So 3.16e-5 * 0.632 ≈ 1.99e-5 → about 2e-5.

So nSi_1 ≈ 2e-5 * nH_1.

Wait, but wait, isn't nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nSi_1) / nH_1 = (2e-5 * nH_1) / nH_1 )? No, wait, nFe_1 is 3.16e-5 * nH_1, and nSi_1 is 6.32e-5 * nH_1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me re-express nSi_1.

Wait, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

nFe_1 = 3.16e-5 * nH_1.

nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316.

10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi_1 = 3.16e-5 * nH_1 * 2 * 0.316 → 3.16e-5 * 0.632 → approximately 1.99e-5 → 2e-5.

So nSi_1 = 2e-5 * nH_1.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately:

3.16e-5 * 0.632 = 3.16 * 0.632 * 1e-5.

3.16 * 0.632 → approximately 1.997.

So 1.997e-5 → approx 2e-5.

So nSi_1 = 2e-5 * nH_1.

Hmm, so nSi_1 = 2e-5 nH_1.

Now, Star_2:

Let's do the same for Star_2.

Given:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si] = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → [Mg/H] = log(nMg_2/nH_2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → so nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → same as Sun.

So nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

Wait, but this might complicate things if the hydrogen varies. Alternatively, perhaps I can express all in terms of their own H.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

Which is the same as the Sun's ratio.

So nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 / nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) + 0.3.

But in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → nMg_sun / nSi_sun =1 → so nMg_sun = nSi_sun.

So, log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = 0 +0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 =10^0.3 → approx 2.

So nMg_2 = 2 * nSi_2.

But we also have nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

So, substituting, 2 * nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

But nMg_sun = nSi_sun → since [Mg/Si]_sun is 0.

Wait, let me think. In the Sun, nMg/nH = 1e-5, nSi_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5 as well, because nMg_sun = nSi_sun.

Wait, nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun = 1e-5 nH_sun.

So, nMg_2 = (1e-5 nH_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 = 1e-5 * nH_2.

Wait, but nMg_2 = 2 nSi_2 → so 1e-5 * nH_2 = 2 nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 * nH_2) / 2 = 5e-6 nH_2.

So nSi_2 =5e-6 nH_2.

Hmm, so now we have:

nSi_1 = 2e-5 nH_1.

nSi_2 =5e-6 nH_2.

We need to find the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = (2e-5 nH_1) / (5e-6 nH_2) ) = (2e-5/5e-6) * (nH_1 /nH_2).

The 2e-5 /5e-6 is (2/5) * (1e-5 /1e-6) → (0.4)*10 =4.

So ratio is 4 * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, but what's the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2?

The problem states that the two stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but without knowing their sizes or temperatures, perhaps the hydrogen number density (nH) depends on their surface gravity or other factors, which isn't provided. Hmm, but wait, the question says to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), but I don't see how that directly affects the hydrogen density ratio.

Wait, but perhaps in the photosphere, for main-sequence stars, the scale height relates to the surface gravity. But without more information, maybe we can assume that the number density of H is the same in both stars, i.e., nH_1 = nH_2. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H number density is the same, so the ratio of nH_1/nH_2 is 1.

Wait, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H is determined by the star's mass and radius, but without knowing the radius, this is unclear.

Wait, but maybe in the photosphere, the number density is proportional to stellar gravity. The number density of hydrogen nH is proportional to (M / R^2) * (1 / (m_H * k T)) ), but without knowing the temperature or radius, it's hard to find.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the hydrogen density is the same for both stars, so nH_1 =nH_2.

If that's the case, then the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 =4 * (1) =4.

But wait, looking at the options, 4 is not one of them. The options are ~3.9, 12.6, 0.8, 1.2.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back and check.

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5 (since 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5).

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) +0.3.

nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) → (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316.

So, log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(0.316) +0.3 → log(0.316) is about -0.5, so -0.5 + 0.3 = -0.2 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^(-0.2) ≈0.631.

So nSi_1 =0.631 * nFe_1.

But nFe_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1=0.631 *3.16e-5 *nH_1 → 1.99e-5 nH_1.

Which is 2e-5 nH_1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2)=log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

But nMg_sun =nSi_sun → log(1) +0.3=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3≈2 → nMg_2=2 nSi_2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2= nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2= (1e-5 nH_sun) * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) → nMg_2=1e-5 nH_2.

So, 1e-5 nH_2=2 nSi_2 → nSi_2=5e-6 nH_2.

Thus, the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = (2e-5 nH_1) / (5e-6 nH_2) ) = (2e-5/5e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2) ) = (4) * (nH_1/nH_2).

So ratio =4 * (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't proceed. But the problem says to compute the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = 4*(nH_1/nH_2).

Wait, but wait, perhaps nH_1 and nH_2 can be related through the stars' masses and radii. But without knowing the radius, maybe we can assume that the surface gravity is the same, which would relate the scale heights. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen number density is the same for both stars, nH_1 =nH_2. In that case, the ratio would be 4.

But looking back at the options, none of them is 4. The closest is option A, ~3.9.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's compute 2e-5 /5e-6 accurately.

2e-5 = 2 * 10^-5.

5e-6 =5 *10^-6.

Dividing them: (2e-5)/(5e-6) = (2/5) * (10^-5 / 10^-6 )= 0.4 *10^1=4.

So that part is correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, the problem statement says that the stars each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But how does that affect the hydrogen number density in the photosphere?

In main-sequence stars, the surface gravity (g) is proportional to (M/R²). The number density nH is proportional to (g)/(kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Without knowing the radius or temperature, it's hard to relate. However, for stars with higher masses, typically the radius is larger, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for stars of similar spectral types, the radius doesn't vary too much, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is assuming that the stars are identical in all aspects except for their abundances. Or perhaps the ratio of H is taken as the same, so nH_1 =nH_2.

If that's the case, then the ratio would be 4, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another way: perhaps the problem is asking for [Si/Fe] or another ratio, but no, the question clearly asks for the ratio of silicon atoms.

Wait, maybe I should compute [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio.

Wait, let's try that approach.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → which is given.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → which is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

As before, nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → 2 * (1e-5 /1e-4.5 )= 2 * 1e-0.5 → 2 * 0.316 → 0.632 → so nSi_1 =0.632 *nFe_1.

nFe_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1 → nSi_1= 0.632 *3.16e-5 *nH_1 → 1.99e-5 nH_1.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → log(1.99e-5) - log(1e-5).

log(1.99e-5) is log(1.99) + (-5) → approx 0.29899 -5 = -4.701.

log(1e-5) is -5.

So [Si/H]_1 = (-4.701) - (-5) )= 0.299 → approximately 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → log(1) +0.3=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2=2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =1e-5 nH_2.

So, nMg_2=2 nSi_2 → 1e-5 nH_2 = 2 nSi_2 → nSi_2=5e-6 nH_2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → log(5e-6) - log(1e-5).

log(5e-6) = log(5) + (-6) ≈0.69897-6= -5.301.

log(1e-5)= -5 → [Si/H]_2 = (-5.301) - (-5) )= -0.301 → approximately -0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 is about +0.3, [Si/H]_2 is about -0.3.

So the ratio of [Si]_1 to [Si]_2 is (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) )= 10^(0.6) ≈3.98 → approximately 4.

So the ratio is about 4, which matches option A, ~3.9.

So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the Sun's photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Data and Relationships:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).
   - In the Sun, \( n_{\text{Mg}} = n_{\text{Si}} \), so \( n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Calculations:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(10^{-5} / 10^{-4.5}) + 0.3 = \log(10^{-0.5}) + 0.3 = -0.5 + 0.3 = -0.2 \).
- \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{-0.2} \approx 0.631 \).
- \( n_{\text{Si,1}} = 0.631 \cdot n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 0.631 \cdot 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \approx 1.99 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \).

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(1) + 0.3 = 0.3 \).
- \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
- \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Si,2}} \).
- Since \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), \( n_{\text{Si,2}} = (10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}) / 2 = 5 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
- The ratio of silicon atoms is \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{1.99 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{5 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{1.99}{5} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{1} \).
- Assuming \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \) (equal hydrogen density for simplicity), \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 4 \).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **4**, which corresponds to **Option A (~3.9)**.
