Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So the solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphates, I think. 

Wait, KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ H2PO4^-. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is Na+ HPO4^2-, but wait, it's the dihydrate. So when it dissolves, it probably releases the HPO4^2- ion and water. 

The question gives the masses of both compounds as 1.00 g each, and the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. I need to find the concentration, so I probably need to find moles of each and see how they interact in solution.

First, I should calculate the moles of each compound. Let's see: the molecular weights are given. For KH2PO4, Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00735 moles. 

Then for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol equals about 0.00561 moles. 

So in the solution, we have 0.00735 mol of KH2PO4 and 0.00561 mol of Na2HPO4·2H2O. But when they dissociate, what do they give? 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-: so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water, but that doesn't contribute to ions). So each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations come from these two salts. But how does that relate to orthophosphate (PO4^3-)?

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given Ka values are for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

So the solution will be a buffer solution because we're mixing a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accept a proton to become H3PO4). So the system will involve H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent in the dissociation steps.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which is the PO4^3- ion. How does that come into play? Well, PO4^3- is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So to get PO4^3-, we need to deprotonate HPO4^2- further, but that's a very weak acid, since Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Wait, but the system here is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution will determine the concentration of each species. But orthophosphate (PO4^3-) comes from deprotonation of HPO4^2-. So, perhaps I need to find the pH of the solution, and then calculate [PO4^3-] based on that.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that the phosphate species are in equilibrium, and I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 value.

So first, I should find the pH of the solution. Since we have a buffer solution made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. The relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.21 (since pKa = -log(Ka)). Wait, wait. Let me calculate that: log(6.2e-8) is about 7.21. So pKa is 7.21.

Wait, wait a second. The H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and that's the second dissociation step. So the pKa here is Ka2, which is the second ionization constant. So yes, I should use that.

So, the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.00735 and 0.00561, respectively. Since the volume is 0.2 L, their concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M, and [HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

So plugging into the Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Calculating the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763. The log of 0.763 is approximately -0.117. So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute [base]/[acid] = (0.00561/0.2)/(0.00735/0.2) ) = 0.00561 / 0.00735 ≈ 0.763. The log of 0.763 is about log(7.63e-1) = log(7.63) + log(1e-1) )= 0.883 -1 = -0.117. So pH = 7.21 - 0.117= 7.093.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the buffer components. Wait, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So when using Henderson-Hasselbalch, it's pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). So that's correct.

So the pH is approximately 7.093. Now, we need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution.

PO4^3- is the next deprotonation step from HPO4^2-. The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, which is very small. 

So the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression for Ka3. 

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M. [H+] can be calculated from the pH. pH =7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Let's calculate 10^(-7.093). 

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.093) is about 0.835. So 8.35e-8. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, using a calculator:

pH =7.093 → H+ = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So putting it all together:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.29e-8)

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.049 / 8.29 ) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.608 * 1e-6 = 6.08e-7 M.

Wait, but wait another second. The solution's pH is ~7.09, which is just slightly above neutral. How does this affect the availability of H+ for the third dissociation? Since Ka3 is so small, the PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

But according to this calculation, it's about 6.08e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me recheck the calculations.

Molarity of H2PO4^-: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = 0.00735 mol. 0.00735 / 0.2 L= 0.03675 M.

Molarity of HPO4^2-: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol= 0.00561 mol. 0.00561 /0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Henderson: pH = 7.21 + log(0.02805/0.03675)=7.21 + log(0.763) ≈7.21-0.117 =7.093.

[H+]=10^-7.093.

10^7.093 = 1e7 * 10^0.093. 10^0.093 is about 1.24. So 1e7 *1.24=1.24e7. So 1/[H+]=1.24e7 → [H+]=8.06e-8 M. Wait, I think I might have miscalculated earlier.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 10^(-7.093) precisely.

Let me get the exact value of 7.093. Let's compute it as:

7.093 =7 + 0.093.

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.093)= 1/(10^0.093). Let's compute 10^0.093.

We know that ln(10^0.093)=0.093*ln(10) ≈0.093 *2.3026≈0.214. So e^0.214 ≈ approx 1.238. So 10^0.093≈1.238. So 10^(-0.093)=1/1.238≈0.807.

So 10^(-7.093)=1e-7 * 0.807=8.07e-8 M.

So [H+]=8.07e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-]= (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3=1.8e-12; [HPO4^2-]=0.02805 M.

So numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator:8.07e-8 M.

So 5.049e-14 /8.07e-8= (5.049/8.07) *1e-6.

5.049 /8.07 ≈0.6257. So 0.6257e-6=6.257e-7 M.

So approximately 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Is there another factor I'm missing? Like, does the solution account for all the possible sources of PO4^3-?

Wait, another thing to consider: the solution also has K+ and Na+ ions, but those are spectator ions and don't affect the phosphate equilibria. So that's not an issue.

Another point: when we dissolve the salts, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution. But the system is a buffer, so the pH is determined by the ratio of these two ions. Then, the third deprotonation step (to PO4^3-) is determined by the pH and the Ka3.

So the calculation seems correct. The [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.25e-7 M, which is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the equilibrium involving the phosphate species. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation of these compounds introduces H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively, forming a buffer system. The pH of the solution is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.00735}{0.2} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.00561}{0.2} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The relevant pKa is pKa₂ = -\log(Ka₂) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21.  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]
Here, the base is HPO₄²⁻ and the acid is H₂PO₄⁻. Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.03675}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the equilibrium expression
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄}^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The equilibrium constant is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄}^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄}^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- \([\text{H}^+]\) is calculated from pH:  
  \[
  [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
  \]
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]
  \[
  [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \(6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option **A**.
