Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has two bromine atoms on opposite bridgeheads.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, especially in such conditions, I think it's an elimination reaction. Maybe dehydrohalogenation. But wait, dibromides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but in adamantane's case, elimination would form a double bond somewhere.

Wait, considering the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids are often alkenes or maybe epoxides? But wait, the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after KOH treatment must have a carbonyl group. Oh, right! When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, if the dihalide isn't vicinal but maybe on bridgehead positions, perhaps elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing something else to happen.

Wait, another possibility: since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's a diepoxy situation? No, wait. Alternatively, when KOH is used in such a situation, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Wait, no, the product has a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe it's a epoxide formation? No, because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination forming an alkene with some rearrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, maybe it's an intramolecular substitution? Or maybe each Br is replaced by hydroxide, but that would form diol. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe the product is a ketone, which would have a carbonyl. So how does that happen?

Wait, another thought: the Hofmann elimination. But that's usually for amines. Hmm. Alternatively, when dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form ketones. Wait, but how? Oh wait, perhaps when both bromines are on adjacent carbons (vicinal), elimination can form an alkene, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's not adjacent. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. So for each Br, the KOH could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid. So maybe the product is an adamantine ring with a double bond. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an oxidation. Wait, KOH isn't usually an oxidizing agent. Unless it's in a dehydrohalogenation with some peroxide or something else. But the question states KOH and heat.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around where esters or ketones appear. So product 1 has a carbonyl. So maybe it's an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, no, epoxide's carbonyl is lower? Or maybe it's a diketone? But with two carbonyls, that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but then followed by some oxidation? No, because KOH wouldn't do that. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-like elimination, but pinacol is vicinal diol. Wait, maybe if the dihalide is treated with a base, it leads to a ketone. Pinacol rearrangement involves diol elimination to form ketones. But wait, I'm not sure if dihalides can do that.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The NMR data is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So let's think about what this could be. The 4.79 ppm doublet (2H) could be an -OCH₂- group, perhaps in an epoxide or ether. Or maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely as it would be a singlet. Wait, but 4.79 for 2H—maybe an -OCH₂- group. The 2.41-2.23 for 10H suggests some equivalent protons, perhaps in a bridge structure. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set, perhaps a CH₂ adjacent to something.

Wait, putting this together, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Because epoxides have two oxygen atoms, but in the IR, the peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't align with epoxide (C-O-C would have a peak around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹). Hmm. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, if it's a ketone, then the NMR would have a peak for carbonyl, but carbonyl protons don't appear, unless it's an enol. So perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH₂-O group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether.

Wait, product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. So, perhaps, each Br is replaced by an OH group, leading to a diol. But diols don't have carbonyls. So that doesn't fit.

Another angle: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene? But then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene, but then maybe some oxidation occurs. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically applies to amines.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the reaction is a substitution. KOH could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene via E2 mechanism. But in adamantane, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond? But bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Wait, but adamantane is highly strained, so perhaps it's possible.

Wait, but the product after KOH has a carbonyl. So maybe the initial product is an alkene, which then undergoes some reaction in situ, but the conditions are just KOH and heat. Not seeing it.

Wait another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes the base can form an enolate. Wait, but enolates imply a carbonyl is present. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, but how?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but that typically involves enol ethers.

Wait, perhaps I'm better off moving forward. Let's think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. When used in such reactions, it's often involved in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and after treatment with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's enabling some acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the initial product. NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. For example, an ether (-OCH2-) or ester (-CO-OCH2-) group. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which is a lot. Adamantane has 12 hydrogens in its structure, but the product may have lost some due to substitution or elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has 12 hydrogens minus 2 (since each Br replaces H?), so 10 H. But the NMR shows 10 H in that region, maybe as equivalent protons in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. So, the formula would be similar but with an oxygen. But then the IR would show C-O-C peaks, which are around 1200 cm⁻¹. The given IR peak is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, creating a new carbonyl group. How? Oh! Maybe the base is causing a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Wait, but that's not something I'm familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires peracids. Not with KOH.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the dihalide to form two hydroxide groups, but that would give a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an oxidation of the diol? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Maybe it's a Hofmann-Löffler reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: the product's NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). A triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So maybe the -CH₂- is next to another -CH₂- group. For example, in an ester group, like O-C-O, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, where each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. Because cyclopropane rings can give specific NMR shifts. But the IR still doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should move to the second step and see if that helps. The product 1 is heated with excess Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Ozonolysis breaks alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Because when ozonolysis is done, it cleaves the double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond. So, after ozonolysis, product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the real question is about the NMR of product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchanging with solvent.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl) via KOH and heat.

2. Product 1 → product 2 via Al(OiPr)3 heat.

3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

We need to find the NMR coupling of the most deshielded H in product 3.

So, let's try to figure out each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming that, with KOH, the two bromines are eliminated as HBr, and a double bond is formed. But wait, for a double bond, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, so product 1 must have a carbonyl group. Therefore, the initial reaction must form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination where each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, leading to a ketone. But how?

Another approach: Maybe the dihalide is treated with a strong base to form a ketone via a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is converted into an epoxide, but that would require a peracid, which isn't present here.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about what product 1's structure might be. The NMR shows a triplet around 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be equivalent adamantane CH groups, and 1.94 (2H) another CH2.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. So, an adamantane ring with an epoxide group. But that would have an O-C-O structure, which would have a peak around 1200 cm⁻¹, not 1720. So that can't be.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone. Suppose that the two bromines are eliminated, and a carbonyl is formed. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would form an oxide.

Wait, another possibility: the base induces an elimination, forming a ketone. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are not adjacent but on opposite bridgeheads. So elimination would not form a double bond; perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening elimination. For example, if the adamantane ring opens to form a chain with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would be a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a coupling reaction. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction between dihalides and bases.

This is getting me stuck. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe product 1 is a diketone. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base is causing each Br to be replaced by an -O⁻ group, which upon protonation becomes an -OH, but that would form a diol. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination with the base abstracting two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a ketone. For that to happen, the molecule would need to lose two HBr and form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons (vicinal), but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which are not adjacent. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the second step. Product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to facilitate some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 doesn't have an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to form an acylium ion or to protonate something.

Wait, another thought: product 1 has a carbonyl, so when treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it forms an enol or something that can undergo some alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it. Epoxide ring-opening with Lewis acids typically leads to carbocation formation. But the product after that would be an alcohol or something else.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a carbonyl. So maybe after opening, the product has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to form some kind of enolate, which then does something. But I'm not certain.

Hmm. Let me think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which has carbonyl groups.

So, the initial product 1 is something that, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to perform a dehydration, forming an alkene. Because AlCl3 is often used as a catalyst for dehydration of alcohols to alkenes or ketones to alkenes via enol formation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So if it's a ketone, then Al(OiPr)3 would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Wait, but ketones don't usually lose protons to form enolates under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has an alcohol group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show an OH peak. Alternatively, the OH is in an ether or something else.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about each step and see if I can link them.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 with carbonyl.

Step 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (maybe an alkene).

Step 3: product 2 ozonolysis → product 3 (has carbonyl groups).

So, product 3 is formed by breaking a double bond into carbonyls.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the most deshielded H's coupling.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded H would typically be near electronegative atoms or in a strained structure. Since ozonolysis breaks double bonds, the product would have carbonyl groups.

In ozonolysis, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl. So, if the double bond in product 2 is symmetric, product 3 would have two identical carbonyl groups. But if the double bond is asymmetric, the ozonolysis would form two different carbonyl compounds.

But let's suppose product 2 has a symmetric double bond, leading to product 3 with two identical carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure, so let's think about the possible structure of product 3.

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl group, perhaps as a ketone or an aldehyde. The most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

In a carbonyl group, the α protons (next to carbonyl) are deshielded and typically appear downfield. Their coupling depends on their neighboring protons.

For example, in a diketone, each ketone group would have α protons. If each α proton is adjacent to another CH₂ group, their coupling could be a doublet or more complex.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, each carbonyl group is at the end of a chain. For example, if product 2 is a symmetric alkene, product 3 would have two aldehyde groups or ketone groups. But adamantane's structure is rigid, so the double bond in product 2 is likely in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces a diepoxide or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, going back. Let me think about the initial step again. Since product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide that's opened to form a carbonyl. Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide is treated with KOH and undergoes a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are not adjacent but on opposite bridgeheads. So elimination would be difficult.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening elimination. For example, the base removes a Br and a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, leading to the ring opening and forming a carbonyl.

But I'm not certain. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it, forming a diol, which then dehydrates to form an alkene. But why would Al(OiPr)3 help with that?

Alternatively, product 1 could be a cyclic ether, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3, undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement to form an alkene.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't think adamantane has an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 facilitates a dehydration, forming an alkene.

Wait, that makes sense. So step 1: dihalide → ketone (product 1). Step 2: ketone + Al(OiPr)3 → alkene (product 2). Step 3: alkene → ozonolysis product (product 3).

If that's the case, then product 2 is an alkene derived from a ketone via dehydration. So product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

So, product 2 would have a structure like (R)₂C=CH₂ or similar.

When ozonolysis is performed on product 2, it would cleave the double bond and form carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is something like CH₂=CHCOCH3, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing products.

But in our case, product 2 is derived from adamantane, so the structure would be more complex. Let's imagine product 2 is adamantane with a double bond somewhere, perhaps in a bridge.

When ozonolysis is done on product 2, it would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would then be connected to the rest of the adamantane structure.

But considering that, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The H's adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So, for each carbonyl, the adjacent CH₂ group would have protons that are split based on neighboring protons.

Suppose each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH₂-CH₂ group. Then, each of the CH₂ protons would be split by their neighboring protons.

Wait, but the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons. For example, in a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂, each proton in the first CH₂ would be next to two equivalent protons in the adjacent CH₂. That would lead to a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH₂ is next to another CH₂, which is split into a triplet, and each of those is next to another set of protons, then the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Suppose the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups on each end. Then, each aldehyde has a CH₂ group adjacent to it. The CH₂ groups would each be next to another CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH₂ is attached to a carbonyl, then each proton in the CH₂ would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So each would be a triplet.

But let's imagine a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an adamantane with a double bond in a bridge, like a cyclopropane ring. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups, each connected to the rest of the adamantane.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone. So, each ketone has a CH₂ group attached to it. Those CH₂ groups would each be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to each having a triplet coupling.

But how many neighboring protons are there?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ groups are adjacent to another CH₂ group, but those are also adjacent to another group, perhaps leading to more coupling.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Each of these protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group. So each would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each of these CH₂ groups is also next to another CH group, leading to more splitting. For example, if the structure is CH₂-CO, then each CH₂ proton is adjacent to two protons on another CH₂ group. So each would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, which is in turn adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring protons. Each proton in that CH₂ would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So their coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, then each CH₂'s protons would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. So perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, another possibility: if each CH₂ is adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, each with two protons, then each proton would have more neighbors, leading to a more complex coupling.

Wait, but in a typical case where a CH₂ is next to another CH₂, each proton in the first CH₂ would be split by two protons on the second CH₂, giving a triplet. So the coupling would be a triplet.

Another possibility is that each CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group which is itself split into a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that would require each proton being split by two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each proton is adjacent to two protons and also to another set of two protons, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-O.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of an alkene would produce carbonyl groups. So for a simple alkene like CH₂=CH₂, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in our case, the structure is more complex.

Suppose the ozonolysis produces a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, and each CH₂ group is attached to another CH₂. So the structure would be O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO. Then, each CH₂ group has two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet for each.

Wait, but each CH₂ in the middle would have four neighboring protons (from two CH₂ groups), but in reality, each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ on both sides. So each CH₂ would have two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH₂, but that's four in total. Wait, but each proton only couples with adjacent protons through J coupling, so in such a case, each CH₂ would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, but the other end of that CH₂ is connected to another group. So each CH₂ would have two neighboring protons, making a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is a triplet because each H is next to two H's on the adjacent CH₂.

So the most deshielded H (on the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another possibility: the CH₂ groups are adjacent to another CH₂ which is split into a triplet, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH₂ is next to a CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like O=C-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, the CH₂ would be adjacent to a CH group, which has two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures again.

The original molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. After KOH, product 1 has a carbonyl. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3, which probably forms an alkene. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene in a bridge structure of adamantane, ozonolysis would break the bridge into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product would have two ketone groups attached to the adamantane.

The most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Each would be in a CH₂ group. Each CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to a triplet coupling.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Thus, the answer should be A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a carbonyl group, likely a ketone.  
   - A plausible explanation is that the two bromine atoms are eliminated as HBr, forming a ketone via a double dehydrohalogenation mechanism.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   - Product 1 (the ketone) is heated with Al(OiPr)₃, a Lewis acid.  
   - Al(OiPr)₃ likely facilitates dehydration of the ketone, forming an alkene (product 2).  
   - The resulting product 2 contains a double bond, which will be cleaved in the next step.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 (the alkene) undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide addition.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby protons.

4. **Analysis of the NMR Coupling Pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Each proton in this CH₂ group couples with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.  
   - This matches the description of a triplet in the options.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
