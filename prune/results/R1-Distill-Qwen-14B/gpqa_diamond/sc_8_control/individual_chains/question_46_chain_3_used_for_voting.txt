Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's read it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene complex, which facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because the position of the double bond and substituents matter.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pentene chain has five carbons, double bond at position 1 (so between C1 and C2?), and a methyl group on C3.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So when it's 3-methyl, it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But wait, wait. So the starting material is a racemic mixture. Racemic implies it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, is the starting alkene actually chiral? Because for an alkene to be a chiral center, the double bond must be adjacent to a chiral center. Hmm, wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C2 has a CH2 group, C3 has a methyl group and two CH2s. Wait, no, C3 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C2 (double bond), C4, which is CH2, and the methyl. So, does C3 have four different groups? Let me see: C3 is connected to CH2 (from C2, which is double bonded to C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups (on either side, perhaps). Wait, no. Let me think: The structure is:

1      2                3       4       5
CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So correct structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but in this case, C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), C3 (single bond), and two CH2 groups? No, C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), two CH2 groups (from C3?), wait I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to number the carbons. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C3 is CH(CH3), which is connected to C2 (from double bond, so single bond), C4 (CH2), and a methyl group.

So, for C3, the groups are: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and a methyl? No, wait, C3 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

- one CH2 group (from C2),
- one CH2 group (from C4),
- a methyl group (CH3),
- and a hydrogen? Because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4?), a methyl, and a H? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH- (double bond to C1)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3.

So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Now, is this molecule chiral? Because a racemic mixture implies a pair of enantiomers. But for a molecule to have a chiral center, a carbon must have four different substituents. Let's look at C3 in this molecule.

C3 is connected to:

- CH2- (from C2, which is double bonded to C1),
- CH(CH3) (itself),
- CH2- (from C4),
- And perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the CH(CH3) is the central carbon. So substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2: C2 is CH-, so the substituent is CH2=CH-),
Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong. Let me list the substituents attached to each carbon.

C3 is connected to:

1. The CH2 group from C2 (which is double bonded to C1, so C3 is connected via a single bond to C2's CH group).
Wait, perhaps a better approach is to check each carbon.

C1: CH2=CH...
C2: CH- (double bonded to C1), single bonds to C3.
C3: CH(CH3) (so, attached to C2 (CH2?), C4 (CH2?), and a methyl group).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. Is the starting molecule chiral? For that, any carbon in the molecule need to have four different substituents.

Looking at C3: What are the groups attached?

- One group is the CH2- from C2 (which is part of CH2=CH).
- Another is the methyl group.
- Another is the CH2- from C4 (which goes to CH2CH3).
- The fourth group is a hydrogen. Because the structure is CH(CH3), which has CH3, and three other single bonds. So the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2=CH- (from C2),
- CH2CH2CH3 (from C4),
- CH3 (methyl),
- H.

Wait, that would make four different substituents. So C3 is a chiral center. So the molecule as a whole is chiral, and the racemic form means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers.

Okay, now the molecule is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Grubbs catalyst is for olefin metathesis. So the double bond will undergo metathesis.

In olefin metathesis, the catalyst will break the double bonds and rearrange them. Grubbs typically causes ring-closing metathesis if possible, but in this case, the molecule is a straight chain. So it can undergo either ring-closing or cross metathesis if there's another alkene. Wait, but in this problem, it's just 3-methylpent-1-ene. So perhaps it's a ring-closing metathesis, but that would require the molecule to form a ring. Let me think.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. It's a five-carbon molecule. If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it could form a cyclic structure. But let's think about the possible products.

Alternatively, if it's an open chain, Grubbs would cause the metathesis, which could lead to different alkenes. But since Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, perhaps this is a ring-closing scenario. Wait, but how? Because the molecule is a straight chain, so the ends would have to meet. Let me calculate the possible ring size.

The molecule is 5 carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. To form a ring, the ends would have to connect. So the chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The ends are the CH2 at C5 and the CH2=CH at C1. If the catalyst breaks the double bond and recombines it elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, and another potential site for bond exchange. So the catalyst could facilitate the exchange of the ends. For example, the part from C1 (CH2) and the end from C5 (CH3) could swap partners.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of possible metathesis products. Grubbs typically allows for the redistribution of the alkenes.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the molecule would form a ring by connecting the ends. So, the possible ring sizes are determined by the positions. Let me see: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the catalyst causes the double bond to shift, perhaps forming a new double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it would form a ring by connecting C1 to C5, making a five-membered ring (since C1 and C5 are the ends). Let's see:

If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the catalyst breaks the bonds between C2 and C3, and C1 and C5, then perhaps it could form a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism involves the catalyst breaking the double bond and forming new bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-closing metathesis between the two ends of the chain, forming a cyclic product. Let's calculate the possible ring sizes.

The distance between C1 and C5 is four single bonds apart. So forming a ring would create a five-membered ring (since C1 to C5 is four bonds, making five-membered when including the new double bond). Five-membered rings are common in metathesis.

So the product would be cyclopentene derivative. Let's see what the structure would be.

If the metathesis occurs between the two ends, the product would be a cyclopentane derivative with a double bond.

Wait, but when the double bond forms, where would it be? Let me imagine the mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (Grubbs) breaks the double bond, and the two ends (from the ends of the chain) recombine to form a new double bond within a ring.

In this case, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the two ends are the CH2 at C1 (part of the double bond) and the CH3 at C5.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst will cause the double bond to shift. So, the metathesis would result in a new double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, let me think about possible products.

When Grubbs is used on a substituted alkene, the possible products depend on where the metathesis can occur. Since the starting material is a single double bond, the metathesis can lead to different alkenes by breaking and reforming the double bonds.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is symmetric? No, because it's a racemic mixture, so each enantiomer would have opposite configurations, but the structure is otherwise the same.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So it's a 3-methylpent-1-ene. The molecule isn't symmetric because the substituents on C3 (CH(CH3)) are different on either side.

Wait, no, because the molecule is a straight chain, but the substituents on C3 are a methyl and two CH2 groups. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, then the two ends would be the same.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me consider the structure again.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So on the left side (C1-C2), we have a CH2-CH2 group, and on the right (C4-C5), we have a CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. C4 is CH2, connected to C5 (CH3). So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed with the reaction.

So, Grubbs catalyst induces olefin metathesis. In this case, since it's a mono-olefin (only one double bond), the metathesis will likely result in a shift of the double bond position. Alternatively, if another double bond can form, perhaps by breaking and reforming bonds.

Wait, but in a mono-olefin, the metathesis would typically cause a redistribution of substituents, leading to different alkenes. For example, the double bond might shift to a more stable position.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. Another possibility is that the metathesis will cleave the double bond and exchange the ends.

So, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, perhaps the catalyst will cause the breaking of the double bond and then recombine the ends, leading to a new structure.

Wait, so the catalyst can break the double bond into two olefins. But in this case, since it's a mono-olefin, perhaps the metathesis leads to a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a new double bond in the molecule. Let me think about possible sites.

The molecule can undergo metathesis to form a new double bond. The possible sites for the new double bond would be between different carbons.

In CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the possible sites for metathesis are likely between C1 and C2 (the existing double bond) and perhaps between other carbons.

Wait, but Grubbs is more selective. It tends to favor the more substituted double bonds because they're more stable. So if the reaction is a ring-closing, the product would be a more stable ring.

But wait, another approach: the number of possible products. The question asks how many possible products are there, excluding ethene.

Wait, ethene would be a byproduct if the reaction is a simple dimerization, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the catalyst causes the metathesis to produce ethene and another product, but the question says to exclude ethene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-closing metathesis, in which case, the product would be a cyclic compound, and ethene would be a byproduct.

So, if the metathesis forms a ring, the main product would be a cyclic compound, and ethene would be produced as well.

But the problem specifies to exclude ethene, so we're only counting the cyclic products.

Wait, but what's the structure of the cyclic product?

If the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two ends (the double bond ends) would form a new ring.

So, the current molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the Grubbs catalyst takes the CH2=CH- end and the CH2-CH3 end and forms a new double bond, perhaps connecting the CH2 from the end to the CH2=CH, forming a ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as a five-carbon chain with a double bond at the first position.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would facilitate the formation of a ring by breaking the double bond and recombining the ends.

So, breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, and then connecting the CH2 group from C5 to the CH from C2.

Wait, that would form a ring between C1 and C5. Let me see: the original structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the new double bond could be between C5 and C2, but that doesn't make sense because that's a five-membered ring.

Wait, no, perhaps the new double bond is between C2 and C5, but that would require a four-membered ring, which isn't very likely.

Alternatively, maybe the new double bond is between C1 and C5, but that's a five-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

The catalyst breaks the double bond, and the ends (CH2 and CH3) exchange partners.

So, the two ends of the double bond (CH2 and CH2 from C1 and C2) would exchange with the ends of another part of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible products in terms of their structures.

Option 1: The metathesis shifts the double bond to a different position, resulting in a different alkene.

For example, shifting from between C1 and C2 to between C2 and C3, or between C3 and C4.

Option 2: The metathesis forms a ring, producing a cyclic alkene, with ethene as a byproduct.

If Option 2 is the case, then the product would be a cyclic compound, like cyclopentene derivative.

But in this case, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which upon ring-closing would form a cyclopentene with substituents.

Alternatively, let's imagine the product.

If the ring forms between C1 and C5, what's the structure?

That would produce a five-membered ring, with substituents.

The structure would be cyclopentane with a double bond and a methyl group.

Wait, let me count the carbons. So, the starting molecule is five carbons. If we connect C1 and C5, the ring would have five members, so it's a cyclopentene derivative.

The substituents would be:

At C3, a methyl group, and perhaps the double bond would be between C1 and C2 in the ring.

Wait, but let me think about the exact structure.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the ring forms by connecting the CH2 end (C5) to the CH2=CH (C1), the new structure would have a ring with five members. The double bond would be between C1 and C2, and the ring would be connected via the CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclopentene, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is bicyclic or something else, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing metathesis would form a new double bond within the ring. So, the product would be a cyclic diene? Or a monoene.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead rearranges the double bond.

Wait, another approach: the Grubbs catalyst can cause different types of metathesis, including ring-closing and cross metathesis.

Since the starting molecule is a mono-olefin, cross metathesis isn't possible unless another olefin is present, which there isn't. So it's likely a ring-closing metathesis.

So, the product would be a cyclic alkene, and ethene would be produced as a byproduct, but ethene is excluded from the count.

So, how many possible products are formed?

Wait, but considering the starting molecule is racemic, which means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. Would that affect the number of products?

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst doesn't distinguish between the two ends, so each enantiomer would form the same cyclic product. So the racemic mixture would lead to a single product.

Wait, but the product of the metathesis could have different stereoisomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single compound, regardless of the starting enantiomer.

Wait, but perhaps the cyclic product could have some stereoisomerism. Let me think about that.

In the cyclic product, if the double bond is in a certain position, would it lead to cis or trans isomerism?

Wait, the ring-closing would form a cyclopentene derivative. Let's say the new double bond is between C1 and C2 of the ring.

In that case, the substituents on the ring would be a methyl group attached to C3.

Wait, the structure would be cyclopentene with a methyl substituent.

But where exactly would the substituents be?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the metathesis forms a ring, the product would be a cyclic compound with a double bond. The number of possible products depends on the structure of the ring.

Wait, but the starting molecule is symmetric in a way. Or is it?

Wait, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the left side is CH2=CH-CH(CH3), and the right side is CH2-CH3.

No, it's not symmetric because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different.

So the catalyst would form a ring by connecting the CH2 end (from C5) to the CH2=CH group (C1 and C2). So the product would be a five-membered ring with substituents.

In this case, the ring would have a double bond and a methyl group as a substituent.

So, the structure would be a cyclopentene ring with a methyl substituent.

But wait, the exact position of the substituent and the double bond would determine the number of isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing would lead to a single product, and considering the starting material is racemic, the product would have a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is not stereoselective in that way. Or is it?

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is generally not stereoselective in olefin metathesis, but in ring-closing cases, the product configuration can vary.

Wait, but in this case, considering the starting material has a specific configuration (racemic), would that affect the ring product?

Wait, maybe not, because the catalyst doesn't differentiate based on the starting stereoisomer. It would just form the same ring structure regardless.

So, the product would be a single cyclic compound, so only one product, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but wait, the question is about how many products are formed, excluding ethene. So if the reaction produces ethene and another product, but ethene is excluded, then the main product is the cyclic compound.

But the options don't have 1 as an option. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve ring-closing but instead leads to different alkenes by shifting the double bond.

In that case, the number of products would depend on the possible double bond positions.

So, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

Grubbs catalyst could facilitate the metathesis to shift the double bond to another position.

So, where are the possible positions for the new double bond?

Possible positions are between C2 and C3, C3 and C4, and C4 and C5.

Wait, but the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, when metathesis occurs, the double bond could shift to between C2 and C3, or C3 and C4, or C4 and C5.

Wait, but let's think about possible migration sites.

Metathesis can lead to the formation of internal alkenes. So, for a five-carbon chain, possible double bonds after metathesis could be between C2-C3, C3-C4, and maybe C1-C2 (but that's the starting material).

So, how many different products can form?

But wait, the starting material is racemic, which may influence the outcome. But in this scenario, if the double bond shifts, the product would be a different alkene.

So, let's count the possible alkenes.

1. Between C2 and C3: Structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, perhaps the metathesis shifts the double bond to between C2 and C3, making 2-pentene derivative.

Wait, perhaps the structure after metathesis would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it would be CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3)-CH3? No, that's 3-pentene.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-methyl-1-pentene or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can form different alkenes, considering the possible shifts.

Wait, maybe the metathesis can lead to two different products based on the shifting of the double bond.

Wait, no, considering the structure, shifting the double bond from between C1-C2 to between C3-C4 would require cleaving two different positions, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can produce more than one alkene by different shifts.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of three different alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the original structure, the possible products after metathesis could be:

1. 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting material).

2. 3-methyl-2-pentene.

3. 3-methyl-3-pentene.

4. 3-methyl-4-pentene.

But wait, the double bonds can't be between C4 and C5 because that would require the chain to be longer, but perhaps it's possible.

But considering the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible double bond positions after metathesis are:

- Between C2 and C3.

- Between C3 and C4.

- Between C4 and C5.

So, that's three possible positions. But wait, the starting position is at C1-C2, so that's one product. So including that, four possible alkenes.

But the question says to exclude ethene, so if ethene is a byproduct, but the main products are these alkenes, then the number of possible products would be four.

But wait, the starting material is treated with Grubbs catalyst, which leads to metathesis. So, the reaction may not produce ethene unless it's a dimerization.

Wait, Grubbs can cause the dimerization of alkenes, but in this case, the starting material is a mono-olefin. Dimerization would produce a diene and ethene.

So, the products would be ethene and a diene.

But the question says to exclude ethene, so only the diene is considered.

But in that case, the diene would be a product. So how many possible dienes can form?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a diene but instead forms a cyclic product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the reaction is a ring-closing metathesis, the product is a cyclic diene? No, wait, ring-closing would form a single ring with one double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to a single cyclic product.

But if the starting material is racemic, would the ring product be in a certain configuration?

Hmm, perhaps the ring product is a single product.

But the options don't have 1 as a possibility. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead allows the double bond to shift to different positions, leading to different alkenes.

So, the number of possible alkenes would be three (excluding the starting material), but since the starting material is also a product of the reaction (if no shift occurs), it would be four.

Wait, but the question says "excluding ethene". So, if the reaction produces ethene and another product, but the main product is the alkene, which could have four possible structures.

But that would suggest four possible products, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps the number is higher because the starting material is racemic, leading to some stereo-isomerism.

Wait, if the metathesis leads to different stereoisomers, that would increase the number of products.

But the starting material is racemic, which would each form the same product upon ring-closing.

Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer would form a different product.

Wait, no, because the ring-closing would produce the same product regardless of the starting enantiomer.

So, perhaps the number of products is 4, which would be option A.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that the reaction would form a cyclic product. But if the reaction forms different alkenes, leading to four products (including the starting material), then the answer would be A)4.

But another approach: the metathesis can occur in such a way that the double bond could shift in two different ways, leading to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the possible products after metathesis are 3-methylpent-1-ene, 3-methylpent-2-ene, 3-methylpent-3-ene, and 3-methylpent-4-ene.

But wait, for pent-4-ene, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the possible alkenes are:

1. 3-methylpent-1-ene (starting material)

2. 3-methylpent-2-ene

3. 3-methylpent-3-ene

4. 3-methylpent-4-ene

So, four possible products. Thus, the answer would be A)4.

But wait, the question says "excluding ethene". So, if ethene is a byproduct, then the four alkenes are the products. So the answer is 4, option A.

But earlier I thought that the product would be a cyclic compound, which would give only one product, but that doesn't align with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form just one product but multiple. For example, if the ring-closing can occur in different ways, leading to different ring sizes or substituent positions.

Alternatively, maybe the racemic starting material leads to different diastereomers in the product.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: when Grubbs catalyst is used on an alkene, the most substituted double bonds are favored. So, the most stable product would be the one with the most substituted double bond.

In this case, after metathesis, the most substituted double bond would be between C2 and C3, making 3-methylpent-2-ene.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to the most substituted product as the major product, but the question is about the possible products, not the major.

So, the reaction could theoretically produce all possible alkenes, which are four in this case.

Hence, the answer would be 4, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, a transition metal carbene complex used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, leading to redistribution of substituents. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, with a double bond between C1 and C2. The molecule is racemic, meaning it exists as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Type**: Grubbs catalyst typically promotes olefin metathesis, which can involve either ring-closing metathesis (RCM) or cross metathesis. Since the starting material is a mono-olefin (single double bond), cross metathesis is not possible, leaving ring-closing metathesis as the primary pathway.

2. **Ring-Closing Metathesis**: In this reaction, the double bond is broken, and the ends of the molecule are rejoined to form a cyclic product. The molecule has five carbons, so the reaction forms a **five-membered ring** (cyclopentene derivative). The double bond in the ring is typically between C1 and C2, and the methyl group remains on C3.

3. **Possible Products**: 
   - The reaction produces a cyclic product (cyclopentene derivative) and ethene as a byproduct. However, the question specifies excluding ethene, so only the cyclic product is considered.
   - The starting material is racemic, but Grubbs catalyst does not distinguish between enantiomers. Both enantiomers of the starting material form the same cyclic product.

4. **Number of Products**: Since the reaction exclusively forms a single cyclic product (a five-membered ring with a double bond and a methyl substituent), there is only one product formed.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces a single cyclic product, and ethene is excluded from the count. Therefore, the number of possible products is **1**. However, none of the provided options match this conclusion. Based on the reasoning, the closest match to the analysis is **Option A (4)**, which may assume additional products from alternative pathways (e.g., shifting the double bond to other positions), though this is not consistent with the reaction mechanism.

Answer: A
