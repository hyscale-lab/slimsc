Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. Hmm. Let me try to remember what I know about this.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two values.

Wait, right. When a particle decays at rest, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the final products must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero. That means their magnitudes are the same but directions opposite.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very small mass. I think in this case, the neutrino's mass can be considered negligible compared to the muon's. So the neutrino's energy will be approximately equal to its kinetic energy, while the muon's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest mass.

So first, let's figure out the energy conservation. The total energy of the system before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy E_nu is approximately equal to its momentum times c, but in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu * c, but since we're using MeV and c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Similarly, for the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but again, with c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

Wait, no, actually, in units where c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So for each particle, E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2). Since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each. So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

This must equal the initial energy, which is m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

So:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that's the equation to solve for p.

Let me write variables without units for simplicity. Let m_mu = 105.7, m_pi = 139.6.

So equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me set x = p. Then the equation is sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = m_pi.

Let me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + m_mu² = (m_pi - x)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x².

Cancel x² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x.

Rearranged: 2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu².

So x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, that's a formula I remember from particle physics. The momentum of each product when a particle decays at rest is ( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 )/(2 m_pi )

Wait, wait, let me compute that.

m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Compute m_pi squared: 139.6^2. Let me calculate that. 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and cross terms are 2 *139 *0.6 = 166.8. So 19321 +166.8 +0.36 = 19488.16? Hmm, maybe better to just compute 139.6 * 139.6.

Alternatively, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16= 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu squared is 105.7^2. Let's compute that. 100^2=10000. 5.7^2=32.49. 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi squared minus m_mu squared is 19488.16 - 11172.49= 8315.67.

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 *29.8 = let's see, 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84. So 8376 -55.84=8320.16. Hmm, which is a little over 8315.67. So 29.8 would give us 8320.16, but target is 8315.67, which is 4.49 less. So 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2) = approx 29.8 - 0.016≈29.784.

So x ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait. The units here. Because in natural units, c=1, so x is in MeV/c. But in terms of momentum, we have p = x. So E_nu = p = x ≈29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.78^2: about 887 (since 30² is 900, 29.78 is slightly less). 29.78^2 = approximately (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 -2*30*0.22 + (0.22^2)= 900 -13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484.

m_mu squared is 105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, because sqrt(12059.34) is sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81.

Wait, because 109.8^2= (100 +9.8)^2=10000 + 2*100*9.8 +9.8^2=10000 +1960 +96.04= 10000+1960=11960 +96.04= 12056.04. Close to 12059.34. So E_mu is approx 109.81 MeV.

Then, the energy of the muon is 109.81 MeV, and its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV, and since its rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately 29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies would be approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Option C is 3.52 and 20.8, which is way lower.

Option B is 7.2 and 32.8, which seems higher than what I got.

Option A is 2.84 and 26.8, which is lower.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation. The pion (Pi⁺) decays into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino's mass is negligible.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal to the neutrino's momentum due to momentum conservation). The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum since its mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} \approx p.
\]
Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) from both sides:
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p.
\]
Rearranging for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} \approx p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \( p^2 = 29.78^2 \approx 886.85 \) and \( m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately equal to its energy:
\[
KE_{\nu} \approx E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
