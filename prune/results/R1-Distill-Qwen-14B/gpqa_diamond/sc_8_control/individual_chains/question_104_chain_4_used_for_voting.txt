Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us something about the planet's presence.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (like the Sun) each have a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. The first planet causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and the second causes 7. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the shift in wavelength (the Doppler shift) relates to the velocity of the star, right? The formula for the radial velocity is v = (λ observed - λ rest)/λ rest, expressed in terms of wavelength shift. So if the shift is larger, the velocity must be higher. 

Oh, right, the RV method equation is something like K = (v) where K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. And K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. 

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )^(1/ something... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K. 

Wait, the formula for K (the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is:

K = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because when the period increases, K decreases, assuming M_p and M_* are constant. Which makes sense because a longer period planet would take more time to orbit, causing a smaller velocity shift each time.

Wait, okay, so if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, what's the ratio of their periods?

Since K ∝ (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) / P^(1/3), and M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 = sqrt[P2/P1]^(1/3) ? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )^{-1}. Because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps more accurately, since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Because K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no, because if K = const * (1/P^(1/3)), then K1 = const * P1^(-1/3), K2 = const * P2^(-1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, K1 = 5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait: because K1 is the velocity for planet 1, K2 for planet 2. So, if K1 is smaller than K2, then P2 must be larger than P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant that depends on other factors (M_p and M_*). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So yes, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can rearrange to find P2/P1. Let me solve for that.

We have K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, let's solve for P2 in terms of P1.

Wait, suppose (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Then, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but wait, if K1 is less than K2, then (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1. So P2 would be less than P1. But if K2 is larger, that would mean that the period is shorter. Because a higher velocity suggests a more massive planet or closer orbit.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have same mass. So the difference in K must be due to the orbital period and distance.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period.

The semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So, if the period increases, K decreases, holding other factors constant.

So, in this case, if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1.

Wait, that would be P2 / P1. So if P2 is smaller, then P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but let's get back to the numbers.

K1 = 5 milliangstrom, K2=7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Then, (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 = P1 * 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1.

Wait, no, because earlier we had P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's redo this. Using K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. Which means it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that would be P2/P1. But since it's less than 1, it's about 0.36 times as long. So planet #2 has a shorter period.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check the reasoning. Because if the RV semi-amplitude K is higher, that suggests a larger velocity, which happens when the planet is closer to the star, leading to a shorter orbital period. So K2 is larger than K1, so P2 is shorter than P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer is A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), assuming the planet's mass and the star's mass remain constant. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the difference in the observed radial velocity shifts (\( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2) must be due to the difference in their orbital periods. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Using the relationship \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods can be derived as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \approx 0.714 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (0.714)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, or about 36% shorter. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **not longer** than that of planet #1 but shorter by a factor of approximately 0.36.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
