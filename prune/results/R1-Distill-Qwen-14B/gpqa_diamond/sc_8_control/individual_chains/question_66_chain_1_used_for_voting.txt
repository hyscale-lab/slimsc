Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. But these operators have to respect certain symmetries to make sense.

First, what's the difference between Poincare and Lorentz symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if Poincare is a symmetry, Lorentz must be too. But the question is which symmetries are required for all operators in SMEFT.

I think SMEFT operators are built to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, right? Because it's a relativistic theory. So all its operators, including the ones in SMEFT, should respect Poincare. Which would automatically mean Lorentz symmetry is also respected because Poincare includes that.

Wait, but wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes higher-order terms. So the low-energy effective theory would still respect the same symmetries as the original theory. So if the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, the SMEFT operators should too. So both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are required.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? I recall that the Standard Model (excluding some beyond the SM physics) generally respects CP symmetry, except for certain sectors like the CKM matrix which has CP violation. But in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? Or is it possible to have CP violation?

Hmm, the SMEFT operators are usually classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. I think that in the SMEFT, operators are allowed to have CP violation if the SM itself has CP violation. So maybe not all operators have to have CP symmetry, but wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but the SM itself doesn't have global CP symmetry; it's only a symmetry in the vacuum. So maybe the SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP. But wait, some sources say that the SMEFT is constructed to preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So the SM has Poincare, gauge, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, let's think about CPT symmetry. The SM respects CPT symmetry, so I think the SMEFT must respect it as well. Because any theory that is Lorentz invariant must respect CPT. Because in relativity, causality and other things require CPT. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT.

So putting it together: all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz (since they're part of a relativistic theory), Poincare (same reasoning), and CPT.

Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, which symmetries must be respected.

The question gives options 1,2,3,4 as four separate points. So the correct ones are 1,2,4?

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

So would that be correct if all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare? But the question says "must be respected by all operators", so they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, the SM respects Poincare, but do the higher-dimension operators in SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare? Or are they only required to respect the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare?

Wait, the SMEFT is built by adding operators that preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So yes, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, Lorentz, gauge, and other SM symmetries. So if Poincare is included, so is Lorentz.

So for the given options, the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4 (because 4 is CPT symmetry). So option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, what about CP symmetry? The question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the operators can have CP violation, then they don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) is not a must.

So the correct answer would be 1,2,4. Which is option C.

Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. That's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

But wait, isn't Poincare a subset that includes Lorentz? So if all operators respect Poincare symmetry, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the required symmetries would be 2 and 4. But that's not an option. Oh wait no, option C says 1,2,4. So yes, because 2 (Poincare) includes 1 (Lorentz), but all operators must satisfy both. Or does including Poincare automatically include Lorentz, so requiring Poincare is sufficient?

Wait, no, because in the answer options, they are presented as individual choices. So if all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then in the options, both 1 and 2 must be included. So in the answer, it's correct that both 1 and 2 are required.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The question states "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT." So for each operator, it should respect these symmetries.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So, if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, which of the options include all required symmetries.

So in the options, option C includes 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But if all operators respect Poincare, do they also automatically respect Lorentz? So including 2 would imply 1. So the correct must-respected symmetries are 2 and 4, but not necessarily 1 separately.

Wait, that's a bit conflicting. Let me think again. The question is, which of the options lists the symmetries that must be respected. So the options are:

A) 1,2.

But option C is 1,2,4. So if all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, which is what I think, then the answer is C.

Wait, I'm a bit torn because some sources might say that Poincare includes Lorentz, so requiring Poincare would be sufficient. But the symmetries that operators must respect include all of them, so if 2 is in the list, 1 is automatically included. But I'm not sure if the question is considering them as separate or not.

Wait, looking at the problem again: the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT?

Wait, no, because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. So perhaps options 2 and 4 are the required. But the option that has both 2 and 4? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Option A is 1 and 2.

Hmm. So if all operators must respect Poincare (which includes Lorentz) and CPT, the correct answer would be 2 and 4, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is considering Lorentz and Poincare as separate.

But that seems incorrect because Poincare is a larger symmetry. So perhaps the correct required symmetries are Poincare and CPT, meaning that option C would have 1,2,4, but that would include 2 (Poincare) which implies 1 (Lorentz). So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 2 and 4, but the only option that includes both is option C, which includes 1,2,4. But wait, is 1 (Lorentz) automatically included because of 2 (Poincare)?

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to know that the SMEFT respects all symmetries of the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry (including Lorentz), gauge symmetry, and CPT symmetry. But whether it has CP symmetry is another matter, as the SM has CP violation.

So the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare (so 2), Lorentz (1, but this is included in 2), and CPT (4). So, the required are 2 and 4. But looking at the options, option C includes 1,2,4. So since 2 implies 1, but the question includes 1 as a separate point, perhaps the answer expects 1,2,4.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SMEFT is a relativistic theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included if Poincaré symmetry is respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not strictly respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in processes like electroweak interactions. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not necessarily have to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since the SMEFT is built to preserve the same symmetries as the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). While Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, the question lists them as separate options, so both must be included. CP symmetry (3) is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
