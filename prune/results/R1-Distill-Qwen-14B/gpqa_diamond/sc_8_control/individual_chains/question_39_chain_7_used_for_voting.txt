Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5*i. Wait, i is the square root of -1, so that's the imaginary unit. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So none are found outside that range.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space. But here, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function isn't zero there. Oh wait, no, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So maybe this is the part where the particle exists, and it's zero elsewhere? Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the question says that when measuring, none were found at x<1 or x>3, so the wave function must be zero outside [1,3]. But the given wave function is for the part where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe that's the expression for the part where x is between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That would imply that the wave function has an imaginary component. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually has a real part and an imaginary part. However, for the probability, we take the modulus squared, which is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So I need to compute that.

So let's write ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b². So here, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

But wait, for the wave function to be normalized, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because outside, the wave function is zero, so integral from -infty to infty is same as 1 to 3.

So ∫ (from 1 to3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So is this the entire wave function, including being zero elsewhere? Or is it just the part that's non-zero between 1 and3? Hmm, the way the question is phrased, the wave function is described as such "in a part of space where it can exist". So perhaps the wave function is zero outside, and given as this expression inside.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|², which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25) for x between 1 and3, and zero elsewhere.

So the integral from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

So let's compute that integral.

Breaking it into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

Which is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2) approximately? About 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the initial wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

Integral of (a²/(1+x)) dx from1 to3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from1 to3 is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1; a² = (0.5)/(ln 2) ≈ (0.5)/(0.6931) ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213). Let me calculate that.

sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849, which rounds to 0.85, so option B.

Wait, but what about the integration limits? From 1 to3. So 1+x runs from 2 to4, so the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(4)-ln(2) = ln(2), correct.

So yes, looks like the correct answer is option B) 0.85.

To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), the wave function is zero outside this range. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is:

   \[
   0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(a \approx 0.85\). Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) 0.85**
