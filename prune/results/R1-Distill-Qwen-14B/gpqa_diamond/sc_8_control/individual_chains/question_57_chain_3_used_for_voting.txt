Okay, so I've got this question about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role, especially in quantum mechanics. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh, and the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only consider these five.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) in the case of elastic scattering is given by a certain formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(s, θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) ), but wait, this might be for a specific approximation or in the case of partial waves. 

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That would be when θ is 0 degrees, because that's the direction of the incident beam. So θ = 0°, so cosθ = 1. 

The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are... Let me think. For l=0, P₀(1) = 1. For l=1, P₁(1) = 1. For l=2, P₂(1)=0.5? Wait, no, wait. Legendre polynomials: I think P₀(x)=1, P₁(x)=x, P₂(x)=(3x² -1)/2, P₃(x)=(5x³ -3x)/2, P₄(x)=(35x^4 -30x² +3)/8 or something. So for x=1, each P_l(1) is 1, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.375? Wait, let me compute them:

l=0: P0(1)=1.

l=1: P1(1)=1.

l=2: P2(1) = (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1.

Wait wait no, because 3*(1)^2 is 3, minus 1 is 2, divided by 2 is 1. So P2(1) is 1. Wait that can't be right, because I thought higher l's might have higher values. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the Legendre polynomial P₂(x) is (3x² - 3)/2 * x^0? No, wait, the general formula is P_l(x) = (1/(2^l l!)) ) * d^l/dx^l (x² -1)^l. Hmm, but for x=1, what's P_l(1)?

Wait, let's compute them step by step:

l=0: P0(x)=1. So P0(1)=1.

l=1: P1(x)=x. So at x=1, it's 1.

l=2: P2(x) = (3x² -1)/2. So P2(1) = (3*1 -1)/2 = (2)/2=1.

l=3: P3(x)= (5x³ -3x)/2. At x=1, 5 -3=2, so 2/2=1.

Wait that can't be right. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me think again. The correct Legendre polynomials:

P0(x) = 1.

P1(x) = x.

P2(x) = (3x² - 1)/2.

P3(x) = (5x³ - 3x)/2.

P4(x) = (35x^4 -30x² +3)/8.

So evaluating at x=1:

P0(1)=1.

P1(1)=1.

P2(1)= (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2= 1.

P3(1)= (5*(1)^3 -3*(1))/2 = (5-3)/2= 1.

P4(1)= (35*(1)^4 -30*(1)^2 +3)/8 = (35 -30 +3)/8 = 8/8=1.

Oh wait, so for any l, P_l(1)=1? That seems strange. Or maybe I'm missing something. No, wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Because for P_l(1), since all the terms are based on (x-1) or something. Wait, no, looking at the expressions, every P_l(1) seems to be 1. Because:

l=0: yes.

l=1: x=1 → 1.

l=2: (3*1 -1)/2 = 1.

l=3: (5*1 -3)/2=1.

l=4: (35 -30 +3)/8=8/8=1.

So each P_l(1)=1. So when θ=0, cosθ=1, so each P_l(cosθ)=1 for any l.

So that simplifies things. So the amplitude f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 ( (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] * 1 )

Wait, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So the sum goes up to l=4. So sum l=0 to 4.

The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ)

In our case, since θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1 )

But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction, which is θ=0°. So we need to compute the imaginary part of f(s,0).

But wait, what is k? Because in the formula, k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to compute k.

The energy is given as E=50 MeV. Electrons have mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So E = 50 MeV is much larger than m_e, so relativistic effects are significant. So perhaps we can approximate k using the relativistic formula.

In natural units (where c=1 and ℏ=1), the relation between energy E and momentum p is E² = p² + m², so p = sqrt(E² - m²). The wave number k is p / ℏ. But in units where ℏ=1 and c=1, k = p.

Wait, but in real units, we can compute it as k = (E² - m²)^½ / (ℏ c). But perhaps it's easier to work in natural units. Let me think.

Let me calculate k in units where c=1 and ℏ=1. Then, E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ approx 49.9974 MeV.

Then, k = p / (ℏ) = 49.9974 MeV / (1 MeV s / (ħ c)) ) Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the wave number k equals p. So for a particle with momentum p, k = p/(ħ). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of MeV and inverse fm. Because the options are given in fm.

Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. The energy is in MeV. Let me think about the units.

The Compton wavelength is ħ c / m_e. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

But perhaps it's easier to use the relation between energy and wavenumber. The formula is k = (2m E)^½ if E >> m, but that's only for non-relativistic cases. Here, E is 50 MeV, m is 0.511 MeV, so E is about 100 times larger. Hmm, but maybe I should use the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), so p = sqrt( E² - m² ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ. So let me compute p in SI units.

m = 0.511 MeV/c² → 0.511e6 eV / (3e8 m/s)^2 → but perhaps it's better to convert everything into kg.

Wait, m_e = 0.511 MeV/c² = 0.511e6 eV / (c²). 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So m_e = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J / (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 / 9e16 kg.

Compute that:

0.511e6 = 5.11e5.

5.11e5 * 1.602e-19 = 8.187e-14.

Divided by 9e16: 8.187e-14 / 9e16 ≈ 9.096e-31 kg.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-14 J.

Compute p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E = 8.01e-14 J.

m c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.18e-14 J.

So E² = (8.01e-14)^2 ≈ 6.416e-27 J².

(m c²)^2 = (8.18e-14)^2 ≈ 6.69e-27 J².

So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 6.416e-27 -6.69e-27 = -2.74e-27 J².

Wait, that can't be right because E is 50 MeV, which is bigger than m c² (0.511 MeV), so E² > (m c²)^2. Oh wait, wait, sorry, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. m c² is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So 50e6 eV is much bigger than 0.511e6 eV. So E² ≈ (50e6)^2 eV², which is way larger than (0.511e6)^2. So E² is much bigger.

So, E² ≈ (50e6)^2 = 2.5e15 eV².

(m c²)^2 ≈ (0.511e6)^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV².

So E² >> (m c²)^2 → so E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ E².

But let's be precise for better calculation.

E = 50 MeV = 5e4 * 1e2 eV = 5e4 * 1e2 = 5e4 * 100 = 5e6 eV? Wait no, 50 MeV is 50e6 eV. Oh right.

So E =50e6 eV, m c^2 =0.511e6 eV.

So E² = (50e6)^2 = (5e7)^2 = 2.5e15 eV².

(m c²)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 ≈ (5.11e5)^2 ≈ (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 eV².

So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 2.5e15 - 2.5e11 ≈ 2.49975e15 eV².

So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c → approx sqrt(2.5e15 eV²) / c.

Wait, sqrt(2.5e15) = sqrt(2.5) * 1e7.5 ≈ 1.581 * 3.16e7 ≈ 5e7 eV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units here. eV/c is a unit of momentum. So p ≈ 5e7 eV/c.

Then, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So k = p / ħ = (5e7 eV/c) / (6.582e-16 eV·s) * (1/(c)) ? Wait, no. Wait, k is p / ħ. Because in natural units, k = p / ħ.

Wait, no, wait. Planck's constant is ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05e-34 J s. But in eV·s units, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, k = p / ħ. So p is in eV/c, and ħ is in eV·s. Wait, so the units need to be compatible.

Wait, maybe I should compute p in units of eV/c, and then convert it to kg m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse meters.

Wait, k = p / ħ. So let me compute p in SI units.

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 eV.

But to get p in kg m/s: E in joules, m in kg, c in m/s.

E = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-14 J.

m c² = 0.511e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.18e-14 J.

So E² = (8.01e-14)^2 ≈ 6.416e-27 J².

(m c²)^2 = (8.18e-14)^2 ≈ 6.69e-27 J².

E² - (m c²)^2 = 6.416e-27 -6.69e-27 = -2.74e-27 J²? That can't be right because E is larger than m c². Oh wait, no, because I think I made a mistake in the computation. Wait, 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV. m c² is 0.511e6 eV. So E is 50e6 eV, which is about 97.8 times larger than m c² (since 50e6 / 0.511e6 ≈ 97.8). So E is much larger than m c², so E^2 >> (m c^2)^2, so E² - (m c^2)^2 ≈ E².

So p ≈ E / c. Because in high energy (relativistic), p ≈ E/c.

So p ≈ E/c = (8.01e-14 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 2.67e-22 kg m/s.

Wait, but that seems off. Wait, J = kg m²/s². So J/s = kg m²/s³ = kg m/s² * m/s → kg m/s * m/s² → no, perhaps better to compute p:

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But since E is 50 MeV, m c² is 0.511 MeV, so E >> m c². So p ≈ E/c.

E =8.01e-14 J.

p ≈ E/c = 8.01e-14 J / (3e8 m/s) = (8.01e-14 kg m²/s²) * s/m => 8.01e-14 / (3e8) kg m/s → 2.67e-22 kg m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = (2.67e-22 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) )

But J = kg m²/s², so J s = kg m²/s.

So kg m/s divided by kg m²/s → 1/m.

So k ≈ (2.67e-22) / (1.05457e-34) m^-1 ≈ 2.53e12 m^-1.

Convert meters to femtometers (fm). 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

Wait, so k = 2.53e12 m^-1 = 2.53e12 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-3 fm^-1.

Wait, wait, that's 2.53e-3 per femtometer, which is a very small number. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 2.67e-22 divided by 1.05e-34 is approximately 2.54e12 m^-1.

Then, 2.54e12 m^-1 = 2.54e12 * (1e15 fm)^-1) = 2.54e12 / 1e15 fm^-1 = 2.54e-3 fm^-1.

Wait, but another approach: The wave number k can be computed as k = (2mE)^½ / ħ, but that's the non-relativistic limit. Since E is much larger than m, let's see. But perhaps using the relativistic formula is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic.

Wait, in any case, perhaps I should proceed with the formula. Let me put this aside for a moment and think about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

The formula for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ].

So Im[f(0)] is the imaginary part of this expression.

Let me compute each term (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ].

Because each term is (2l+1) multiplied by (e^{2i δ_l} - 1), which can be written as (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ].

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Wait, but wait, because the entire expression is (1/(2ik)) * sum terms. So the imaginary part would be Im[ (1/(2ik)) * sum (terms) ].

Let me make this more precise. Let me denote the sum as S = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

So f(0) = S/(2ik).

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im[ S/(2ik) ].

But 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), because 1/(i) = -i.

So f(0) = (-i S) / (2k).

So Im[f(0)] is the imaginary part of (-i S)/(2k).

But since S is a sum of real and imaginary parts, let's compute S first.

Compute each term (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

Let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

l=0: 2l+1 = 1.

δ0=90° → which is π/2 radians. So 2δ0 = 180° → π radians.

e^{2i δ0} = e^{i π} = -1.

So term = 1 * [ (-1) -1 ] = 1*(-2) = -2.

Imaginary part of this term is 0, since it's real.

l=1: 2l+1=3.

δ1=67° → 2δ1=134°.

e^{i(134°)} = cos(134°) + i sin(134°).

Compute cos(134) and sin(134):

cos(134) ≈ cos(180-46) = -cos(46) ≈ -0.694658.

sin(134) ≈ sin(46) ≈ 0.719340.

So e^{2i δ1} = -0.694658 + i 0.719340.

So term = 3 * [ (-0.694658 + i 0.71934) - 1 ] → 3 * [ (-1.694658) + i 0.71934 ].

Which is (3 * (-1.694658 )) + i (3 * 0.71934 ) → -5.083974 + i 2.15802.

So the imaginary part is 3 * 0.71934 = 2.15802.

l=2: 2l+1=5.

δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°.

cos(110) ≈ -0.3420, sin(110)≈0.9397.

e^{2i δ2} = cos(110°) + i sin(110°) ≈ -0.3420 + i 0.9397.

Term =5 * [ (-0.3420 + i 0.9397) -1 ] =5*(-1.3420 + i 0.9397 ) → -6.71 + i 4.6985.

Imaginary part is 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: 2l+1=7.

δ3=30° → 2δ3=60°.

cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

e^{2i δ3} → 0.5 + i 0.8660.

Term=7*(0.5 +i 0.8660 -1) =7*(-0.5 + i 0.8660 ) → -3.5 + i 6.062.

Imaginary part is 7 * 0.8660 ≈6.062.

l=4: 2l+1=9.

δ4=13° → 2δ4=26°.

cos(26)≈0.8988, sin(26)≈0.4384.

e^{2i δ4}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.

Term=9*(0.8988 + i 0.4384 -1) →9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) →-0.9108 + i 3.9456.

Imaginary part is 9 *0.4384 ≈3.9456.

Now, summing all the imaginary parts:

l=0: 0.

l=1: 2.15802.

l=2:4.6985.

l=3:6.062.

l=4:3.9456.

Total imaginary part from the sum S: 2.15802 +4.6985=6.8565, plus 6.062 →12.9185, plus 3.9456 →16.8641.

So the total imaginary part of S is approximately 16.8641.

Wait, but wait. Because each term in S is (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), which has an imaginary component. So the sum S has an imaginary part Im(S) = sum ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ), but wait, because e^{2i δ} -1 = [cos(2δ) +i sin(2δ)] -1 = [cos(2δ)-1] +i sin(2δ).

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)* sin(2δ_l).

So for each l:

l=0: sin(180)=0 → 1*0=0.

l=1: sin(134)=0.71934 →3 *0.71934≈2.158.

l=2: sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: sin(60)=0.8660 →7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456.

So the sum of the imaginary parts is 2.158+4.6985=6.8565 +6.062=12.9185 +3.9456≈16.8641.

So Im(S)=16.8641.

Now, f(0)= S/(2ik).

But since S has an imaginary part Im(S)=16.8641 and a real part Re(S) = sum of real parts.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I found that each term's real part is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1):

l=0: 1*(cos(180)-1)=1*(-2)= -2.

l=1:3*(cos(134)-1)=3*(-1.694658)= -5.08397.

l=2:5*(cos(110)-1)=5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3:7*(cos(60)-1)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4:9*(cos(26)-1)=9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

So the real part sum is -2 -5.08397 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108 ≈ sum:

-2 = -2.

-5.08397 → -7.08397.

-6.71 →-13.79397.

-3.5 →-17.29397.

-0.9108 →-18.20477.

So Re(S)= -18.20477.

So S is a complex number: S = Re(S) + i Im(S) = (-18.20477) + i 16.8641.

Now, f(0) = S/(2ik) = [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] / (2i k ).

But since I'm only interested in the imaginary part of f(0), let's compute that.

Expressing f(0) as: [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] / (2i k )

Let me write this as A + i B divided by (2i), where A= -18.20477, B=16.8641, and k is real.

So [ A + i B ]/(2i) = [ (A + i B) * (-i) ] / (2i * (-i) )) → since 1/i = -i.

Wait, another approach: multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator.

So [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] * (-i) / (2i * (-i) )

i*(-i) = -i² = 1.

So denominator becomes 2 * 1 = 2.

Numerator: (-18.20477)(-i) + i 16.8641 * (-i) → 18.20477 i -16.8641 (i²) → 18.20477 i +16.8641 (since i²=-1).

So numerator is 16.8641 +18.20477 i.

So f(0) = [16.8641 +18.20477 i ] / 2 → 8.43205 +9.102385 i.

Wait, so the imaginary part of f(0) is 9.102385.

But wait, I thought it was [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] / (2i k ). So perhaps I missed the k factor. Let me correct that.

f(0) = S/(2i k ) = [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] / (2i k )

Let me write [ (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 ] as (-18.20477) + i 16.8641 = C.

So f(0) = C/(2i k) = [ C/(2i) ] * (1/k) → [ (C * (-i)) / 2 ] * (1/k )

Because 1/(i) = -i.

So:

C * (-i) = (-18.20477)*(-i) + i 16.8641*(-i) = 18.20477 i -16.8641 (i²) → 18.20477 i +16.8641.

Divide by 2 → [16.8641 +18.20477 i ] / 2 = 8.43205 +9.102385 i.

Then, multiply by (1/k). So f(0) = (8.43205 +9.102385 i) * (1/k).

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (9.102385 /k ).

So Im(f(0)) = 9.102385 /k.

Now, I need to compute k. Earlier, I found that k ≈2.53e-3 fm^-1. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because that would make 1/k ≈ 395 fm, and multiplying by 9 would give 3555 fm, which isn't one of the options. The options are around 177 to 355 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recalculate k.

Wait, E=50 MeV, m_e=0.511 MeV.

Using the relativistic formula, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 c^4 - m^2 c^6 ) / c^2 ? No, wait, perhaps better to write:

p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c².

Wait, no, correct formula is p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c.

But let me express in terms of eV and fm.

Alternatively, use the relation that k = (sqrt(E² - m² c^4 )) / (ħ c).

Wait, because p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c → k = p / ħ = [ sqrt( E² - m^2 c^4 ) / c ] / ħ.

So, k = sqrt( E² - m^2 c^4 ) / ( ħ c )

But E and m are in the same units (e.g., MeV/c² for m, and MeV for E). Let me use units where ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So, ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So, E is 50 MeV, m c² is 0.511 MeV.

Thus, E² - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 -0.261 ≈2499.74 (MeV)^2.

So sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ) = sqrt(2499.74 MeV²) ≈49.9974 MeV.

So, k = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm ) ) → approximately 49.9974 /197.3 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So, k ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, k ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈3.946 fm.

So, Im(f(0)) = (9.102385) / k → 9.102385 / 0.2536 ≈35.87 fm.

But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the hundreds of fm. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute k using the correct formula.

k = sqrt(E² - m^2 c^4 ) / (ħ c )

But E is the kinetic energy plus m c². Wait, no, E is the total energy. So E² = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2.

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 c^4 - m^2 c^10 ) → But perhaps using units where E and m are in MeV, and ħ c is in MeV fm.

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) / c → but in units where c=1, this simplifies.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

k = ( E / ħ c ) * sqrt( 1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 )

So, E=50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So, m c²/E ≈ 0.511/50 ≈0.01022.

So, sqrt(1 - (0.01022)^2 ) ≈sqrt(1-0.0001045 )≈0.999948.

So, k ≈ (50 MeV ) / (197.3 MeV fm ) * 0.999948 →≈50/197.3 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈3.946 fm.

So, Im(f(0)) =9.102385 /0.2536 ≈35.87 fm.

But the options are B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm, etc.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me compute more accurately.

k = sqrt( E² - m^4 ) / (ħ c )

Wait, wait no, units are a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Using the formula k = (2m E )^(1/2) / ħ for non-relativistic, but since E is much bigger than m, it's better to use the relativistic approach.

But perhaps the exact calculation is better.

In units where ħ c=197.3 MeV fm,

k = (sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )) / (ħ c )

= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) / 197.3 → sqrt(2500 -0.261121) ≈sqrt(2499.7389) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So, k =49.99739 /197.3 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So 1/k≈3.946 fm.

So Im(f(0))=9.102385 / 0.2536 ≈35.87 fm.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the formula is Im(f) = (sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )/(2 k )

Wait, let me think again: the formula for f(θ=0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l } -1 ]

So,

f = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1)( cos 2δ_l +i sin 2δ_l -1 ) )

= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1)( (cos 2δ_l -1) + i sin 2δ_l ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1)(cos 2δ_l -1) + i sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l ]

So, the real part is [ sum (2l+1)(cos 2δ_l -1) ]/(2ik ), and the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l ]/(2k )

Because 1/(2ik) * i = 1/(2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l ]/(2k )

Sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l from l=0 to4 is 16.8641 as computed earlier.

So, Im(f(0)) = 16.8641 / (2k )

k=0.2536 fm^-1.

So, Im(f(0))=16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )=16.8641/(0.5072 )≈33.25 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recheck the sum.

Each l:

l=0: 2l+1=1, δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin 180=0 → 1*0=0.

l=1:3, δ=67 → 2δ=134 → sin(134)=0.71934 → 3 *0.71934=2.158.

l=2:5, δ=55 →2δ=110 → sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7, δ=30 →2δ=60 → sin(60)=0.8660 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9, δ=13 →2δ=26 → sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 + 2.158=2.158 +4.6985=6.8565 +6.062=12.9185 +3.9456=16.8641.

So that's correct.

Im(f)=16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )=16.8641/(0.5072 )≈33.25 fm.

But the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none of these options are close to 33 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1e-36 somewhere in unit conversions. Let me check the calculation of k again.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So,

k = sqrt( (50 MeV )^2 - (0.511 MeV )^2 ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= sqrt(2500 - 0.261 ) MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )

= sqrt(2499.739) MeV ≈49.9974 MeV.

So,

k =49.9974 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =49.9974 /197.33 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So 1/k is about 3.946 fm.

So Im(f) =16.8641/(2 *0.2536 ) ≈33.25 fm.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l )/(2 k )

But perhaps I forgot a factor of (1/(2m)) or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should be using the differential cross-section.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is related to the differential cross-section via dσ/dΩ = |f|^2. But the question is about the imaginary part of the amplitude, not the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the scattering amplitude is in units of fm, and perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another possibility: the imaginary part of the amplitude is not the same as the quantity calculated. Wait, in the formula, f is (1/(2ik)) sum ... So when I compute Im(f), perhaps I should have considered that.

Wait, let's re-express f(0) as:

f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) ] / (2i k )

= [ sum ( (2l+1) (cos 2δ_l -1 ) + i (2l+1) sin2δ_l ) ] / (2i k )

= [ A + i B ] / (2i k ), where A is real, B is real.

So,

f(0) = (A + i B )/(2i k )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-i):

= (A*(-i) + B (i^2) )/(2k )

= [ -i A - B ] / (2k )

So, f(0) = (-B -i A )/(2k )

So, the imaginary part is (-A )/(2k )

Wait, this contradicts my earlier approach, but perhaps I made a mistake in handling the denominator.

Wait, alternative approach: Let me compute f(0) as:

f(0) = [ sum (2l+1)( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ] / (2i k )

So, the imaginary part is Im( [ sum ... ]/(2i k) )

Let me compute this as Im( sum [ (2l+1)( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ] ) / (2i k )

Which is [ Im( sum (2l+1)( e^{2i δ_l} -1 )) ] * (1/(2i k )) 

But 1/(2i k ) = -i/(2k ), so:

Im(f) = [ Im(S) ] * (-i/(2k )) 

Wait, but Im(S) is a real number, and multiplying by -i would give an imaginary number. So the imaginary part of f would be [ Im(S) ] * (1/(2k )) 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it as:

f(0) = (S )/(2i k ), where S is a complex number.

So, S = a + i b.

So, f(0) = (a +i b )/(2i k ) 

= [ (a +i b ) * (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ -i a + b ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is (b)/(2k ), since the term with -i a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

Wait, no. Because when you write ( -i a + b ) / (2k ), that's (b )/ (2k ) + ( -i a )/(2k ), so the imaginary part is (-a)/(2k ), and the real part is b/(2k ).

Wait, but S = sum terms, which is a + i b.

So, for S = a +i b, f(0) = (a +i b )/(2i k ) → multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= (a (-i) + i b (-i) ) / (2k )

= [ -i a + b ] / (2k )

So, real part is b/(2k ), imaginary part is (-a)/(2k )

Wait, but earlier I thought the imaginary part was sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l / (2k )

Wait, earlier I thought the sum of (2l+1) sin 2δ_l is the imaginary part of S, which is B.

So, in this case, the imaginary part of f(0) is (-a)/(2k ), where a is Re(S).

But earlier, Re(S) is sum (2l+1)(cos2δ_l -1 ), which is negative.

So, a is negative, so (-a) is positive.

So, Im(f(0))= (-a)/(2k )

In our case, Re(S)=a= -18.20477.

So, (-a)=18.20477.

So, Im(f(0))= 18.20477/(2*0.2536) ≈18.20477/(0.5072 )≈35.87 fm.

But this doesn't match any option.

Wait, but the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the differential cross-section's imaginary part but I don't think so, since it says 'imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.'

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another thought: The wave number k is given by k = (sqrt(E² - m² c^4 )) / (ħ c )

But in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, E is in MeV, m c² is in MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= sqrt(2500 - 0.261 ) MeV / 197.33 MeV fm → sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.9974 MeV.

So,

k =49.9974 /197.33 → ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So 1/k is about 3.946 fm.

Now, using Im(f) = (-a)/(2k ) = (18.20477 )/(2 *0.2536 )=18.20477/(0.5072 )≈35.87 fm.

But the options are B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps in my calculation, I missed a factor of 1000 because of unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me think again. In the formula, k is in inverse meters or inverse femtometers.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 meters.

If k=0.2536 fm^-1, then 1/k =3.946 fm.

But let me check another approach. The Compton wavelength is λ = 2π/(k).

So, λ = 2π/(0.2536 fm^-1) ≈24.87 fm.

Wait, that's the wavelength.

But perhaps I should compute the scattering amplitude as f = (1/(2ik)) sum ... which is in units of length (fm), since k is in 1/fm.

Wait, the amplitude f is in units of length (fm). So the options are 177.675 fm (option C), etc.

But according to my calculation, the Im(f) is about 35.87 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another possibility: I forgot to account for the fact that in the formula for the scattering amplitude, the denominator is 2ik, and since k is in 1/fm, the units would be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as (sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l ) / (2k )

Which is 16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )=16.8641/(0.5072 )≈33.25 fm.

Hmm, but this doesn't match any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that delta is given in degrees, but I used radians somewhere.

Wait, no, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when computing sine and cosine, I indeed converted them to radians. So that should be correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the nuclear radius or something else, but no, the question states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k )

Which is 16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )=33.25 fm.

But again, options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recalculate k more carefully.

E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

k = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) / (ħ c )

But in units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = sqrt(50² - 0.511² ) / 197.33 → sqrt(2500 - 0.261) = sqrt(2499.739 ) ≈49.9974.

So, k =49.9974 /197.33 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So, 1/k is about 3.946 fm.

But that leads to Im(f)≈35.87 fm (from -a/(2k ) where a=-18.20477 ), but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the sum.

Wait, sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) = 0 +2.158+4.6985+6.062+3.9456=16.8641.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 1e-3 somewhere, but I don't see where.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) * sum, which would make f in units of length, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in degrees, but in the formula, the exponential uses radians. Oh! I think I found the mistake.

In the calculation of e^{2i δ_l}, I used degrees, but in reality, the exponential function uses radians. Oh no! I think that's where I messed up.

Yes! That's a big mistake. So when I calculated e^{iθ}, I should have converted degrees to radians.

Oh no, that's a big mistake. So for example, sin(134 degrees) is not 0.71934 when using in exponential. So I need to convert all angles to radians before computing sine and cosine.

So let's recalculate sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) correctly, using radians.

Each δ_l is given in degrees. So 2δ_l is also in degrees.

Let me compute each term again with radians.

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → π radians.

sin(π) =0 → term=1 *0=0.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134° → 134 * π/180 ≈2.34 radians.

sin(2.34) ≈ sin(134°) ≈0.71934.

So term=3 *0.71934=2.158.

l=2: δ=55° → 2δ=110° → 110 *π/180≈1.91986 radians.

sin(1.91986 )≈0.9397 → term=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: δ=30° →2δ=60° → 60 *π/180=1.0472 radians.

sin(1.0472 )=sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660 → term=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13° →2δ=26° →26 *π/180≈0.4537 radians.

sin(0.4537 )≈0.4384 → term=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

So the sum remains the same, 16.8641.

Wait, so even after correcting to radians, the sum is the same. Because I correctly converted degrees to radians before computing the sine.

So the same issue arises: Im(f)=33.25 fm, but options are much larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the scattering amplitude. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ )

So, for θ=0°, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im( [sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ] ) / (2k )

Which equals [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k )

Which is 16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )

Which is approximately 33.25 fm.

But the options are higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me try alternative unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm correctly.

k = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) / (ħ c )

E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

Compute E² - m² = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈2500 -0.261=2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So sqrt(2499.739 )=49.9974 MeV.

Now, ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k=49.9974 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → (49.9974 )/(197.33 ) fm^-1 →≈0.2536 fm^-1.

So 1/k≈3.946 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (E + m )/ (ħ c ), but no, that's not correct. Because E is the total energy, not the rest mass.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for k is (E )/(ħ c ), not sqrt(E² -m² )/ (ħ c ).

Because for high energies, E≈pc, so p≈E/c, then k=p/ħ≈E/(ħ c ).

So, k= E/(ħ c )

Which for E=50 MeV, would be 50 /197.33 ≈0.2536 fm^-1.

Which is the same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by something else. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section via Im(f) ≈ (k/(4π))σ_total.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

But in the calculation, I might have missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, wait: The formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Thus, the imaginary part of f is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

Which I've computed as 16.8641/(2 *0.2536 )=33.25 fm.

But perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the wave number k is in inverse meters, not inverse femtometers.

Wait, no, because I converted k to inverse femtometers. Let me recheck.

Wait, ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → Thus, when E is in MeV, k is in fm^-1.

So, no, I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the relativistic energy E=gamma m c^2, and I'm using E as kinetic energy. But no, the formula uses the total energy E.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that according to the calculations, the correct answer is approximately 33.25 fm, which isn't one of the options, I must have made a mistake. But since the options are given, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]/(2ik )

Hmm, no, that's what I used. So, perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but they were input as degrees. No, the question states the phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum in terms of the imaginary parts correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term as (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) ] and sum those.

Which is what I did, getting 16.8641.

So, 16.8641/(2k )=16.8641/(2*0.2536 )=33.25 fm.

But options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k ))

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include more phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the Born approximation, but no, I think the formula I used is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger than my calculation. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed a conversion factor from MeV to eV.

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm. So MeV is 1e6 eV.

But in the calculation of k, I used 50 MeV and 0.511 MeV correctly.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should have used k = E/(ħ c ), not sqrt(E^2 -m^2 )/(ħ c )

But that would give k=50 MeV /197.33 MeV fm →≈0.2536 fm^-1, same as before.

Hmm.

Another thought: Perhaps the units for k should be in inverse meters, not inverse femtometers, which would change the calculation.

But no, because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^-1 is 1e15 m^-1.

If I compute k in m^-1:

k =0.2536 fm^-1 =0.2536 / (1e-15 m ) =0.2536e15 m^-1.

But that's a huge number, and when used in f, which is in meters, it would give a very small f. Which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think the correct calculation leads to Im(f)=33.25 fm, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift angles.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_0=90°, which is π/2 radians. So for l=0, 2δ_0=π radians. So e^{2i δ_0}=e^{i π}=-1. So the term is 1*(-2)= -2. So in the sum S= (-2) + other terms.

Wait, but that doesn't change the sum of the imaginary parts, because for l=0, the imaginary part is zero.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} ].

But no, the correct formula is [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l }

In that case, the imaginary part would be [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k )

Which is the same as before, because e^{2i δ_l} -1 = [cos 2δ_l -1 ] + i sin 2δ_l.

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin 2δ_l / (2k )

So, same result.

Hmm.

I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, which is roughly twice my calculated value. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the sum is multiplied by (1/(2i k )) and then I should take the real part instead of the imaginary.

No, the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the real part of f(0), but that's not what the question asks.

Hmm.

Another approach: Since the problem gives me phase shifts up to l=4, and the sum gives me Im(f)=33.25 fm, but the closest option is C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.33 times larger (since 33.25 *5.33≈177.675).

Wait, 5.33 is approximately 16/3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recheck:

Im(f)= sum/(2k )

sum=16.8641.

2k=2 *0.2536≈0.5072.

16.8641 /0.5072≈33.25.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 33.25 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct option is not present. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. No, the phase shifts are given in degrees, so that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the magnitude of the amplitude, not the imaginary part. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l }

In that case, the imaginary part would be [ sum (2l+1) cos(2δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Which would give a different result, but I don't see that being the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l }/(2ik )

Which is what I used.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck and perhaps should make an educated guess. Given that the calculation leads to 33.25 fm, but the options are much higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k by a factor of 10.

Wait, if k were 0.02536 fm^-1 instead of 0.2536, then 1/k would be 39.46 fm, and Im(f)=16.8641/(2*0.02536 )=332.5 fm, which is close to option B:355.351 fm.

But why would k be 0.02536?

I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for k.

Another formula for k is k = (2m E )^(1/2) / ħ → non-relativistic.

E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt(2 *0.511 MeV *50 MeV ) / ħ.

But in units where ħ=197.33 MeV fm, this would be:

k = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) MeV → sqrt(51.1 ) ≈7.15 MeV.

k=7.15 MeV /197.33 MeV fm →≈0.0362 fm^-1.

So, Im(f)=16.8641/(2*0.0362 )=16.8641/0.0724 ≈232.8 fm.

Closer to option B, but still not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k= (2m E )^(1/2) / (2ħ )

Which would give k= sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )/(2*197.33 ) → sqrt(51.1 ) ≈7.15 →7.15/(2*197.33 )=7.15/394.66≈0.0181 fm^-1.

Im(f)=16.8641/(2*0.0181 )=16.8641/0.0362≈465.8 fm.

Which is close to option A:87163 fm, but that's way too large.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is approximately 355 fm. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Compute k in terms of 1/fm.

k = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) / (ħ c )

E=50 MeV → E=50e6 eV.

m=0.511 MeV=0.511e6 eV.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm =197.33e6 eV fm.

So,

k= sqrt( (50e6)^2 - (0.511e6)^2 ) / (197.33e6 eV fm )

= sqrt(2500e12 - 0.261e12 ) eV / (197.33e6 eV fm )

= sqrt(2499.739e12 ) eV / (197.33e6 eV fm )

= 49.9974e6 eV /197.33e6 eV fm → 0.2536 fm^-1.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, I'll assume that the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times my calculated value. Perhaps there was a missing factor of 10 in the units somewhere. But I'm not certain.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \left[ e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right],
\]

where \( \delta_l \) are the given phase shifts, \( k \) is the wave number, and the sum is taken up to \( l=4 \) as specified. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}\left(f(0)\right) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)}{2k}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \( (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l) \)
The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). For each \( l \), we calculate \( (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l) \):

- \( l=0 \): \( 2l+1 = 1 \), \( 2\delta_0 = 180^\circ \), \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l=1 \): \( 2l+1 = 3 \), \( 2\delta_1 = 134^\circ \), \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.71934 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.71934 \approx 2.158 \).
- \( l=2 \): \( 2l+1 = 5 \), \( 2\delta_2 = 110^\circ \), \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l=3 \): \( 2l+1 = 7 \), \( 2\delta_3 = 60^\circ \), \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l=4 \): \( 2l+1 = 9 \), \( 2\delta_4 = 26^\circ \), \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l) = 0 + 2.158 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.8641.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}}{\hbar c},
\]

where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm} \). Substituting:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2}}{197.33} \approx \frac{\sqrt{2499.739}}{197.33} \approx \frac{49.9974}{197.33} \approx 0.2536 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Using the formula for the imaginary part of \( f(0) \):

\[
\text{Im}\left(f(0)\right) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l)}{2k} = \frac{16.8641}{2 \cdot 0.2536} \approx \frac{16.8641}{0.5072} \approx 33.25 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.25 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **B (355.351 fm)** is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in unit conversion or an overlooked factor in the problem setup. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**
