Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The scenario involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of E based on the given information.

So, solid A reacts with gas B in an 8:1 ratio to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C reacting with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about possible compounds here. The bright red product C makes me think of something like iodine trioxide or maybe a dichromate? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like sulfur trioxide (which is a liquid, but maybe under certain conditions can be red?) or maybe a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe C is carbon dioxide, but that's not red. Oh wait, maybe C is a compound like Fe(OH)3, which is reddish-brown. Or maybe it's another oxide.

Wait, another thought: The reaction between C and water gives back A and two acids. So, C is likely a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. That makes me think of something like a sulfite or carbonate, but more likely something else. Wait, what if C is a sulfide? No, because when sulfides react with water, they produce H2S and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the other information. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like THF. But D and B are gases reacting to form H. So, if B is a gas and D is a gas, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2, forming HCl which is a gas, but HCl is a liquid or can be a gas under certain conditions, but not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but their reaction would form H2O. Wait, H2O is a solvent. So if H is H2O, then D must be H2 and B is O2? But O2 is a diatomic gas, and H2 is also a diatomic gas. They react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O. That makes sense. So, D is H2 and B is O2. So, D is hydrogen gas, B is oxygen gas. So, H is H2O, which is a solvent. That seems plausible.

So, moving on. Let's see. Reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with O2 (gas) in 8 equivalents. So, 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. What solid reacts with O2 in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe a metal reacting to form an oxide. Let me think: For example, aluminum reacts with oxygen to form Al2O3. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So, in that case, the ratio is 3 O2 per 4 Al, which is 3/4 O2 per Al. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe another metal.

Wait, perhaps it's sulfur reacting with O2. Sulfur in its elemental form is a solid. When it burns, it forms SO2 or SO3. The reaction for SO3 is S + O2 → SO3. Let's see, the balanced reaction: S (solid) + (3/2) O2 → SO3 (gaseous or solid? Sulfur trioxide is a solid at room temp). So, the stoichiometry is 1:3/2, which is 2 O2 per 3 S. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the metal has a high valency. For example, maybe it's a transition metal. Let me think of iron. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. The most common is Fe3O4, which is magnetite. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, per mole of Fe, it's 3/4 O2. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not a metal oxide. Another possibility is a non-metal oxide. For example, carbon reacts with O2 to form CO2. The reaction is C + O2 → CO2. So, 1:1 ratio, but in this case, it's 8 equivalents of O2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. Let me think of lead. Pb reacts to form PbO2. The reaction is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So per Pb, 3/2 O2. Again, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is something else. Let's try another angle. The product C reacts with water to give back A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids. Let's think about possible salts.

If C is a sulfite, like CaSO3, when it reacts with water, it might form H2SO3 (which is unstable and decomposes into H2S and H2SO4, but I'm not sure if that's the case). Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. Wait, no, nitrates usually hydrolyze into nitric acid, which is a strong acid, but perhaps another component. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and another acid salt. Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacting with water gives NH3 and Ca(OH)2, but that's two different bases, not acids. So that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, it would just form H2SO4, which is the same acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water, but that's more about equilibrium in water, producing HCO3^- and OH^-; but that's only one acid, H2CO3. But the problem says two different acids, F and G.

Hmm. So maybe C is a salt of a polyprotic acid. Like sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which when hydrolyzed would produce H2SO3 (a weak acid) and perhaps another acid? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt like NaNO2. When it reacts with water, it might not produce any acid, but perhaps a nitrite ion in solution.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of salt. Maybe a metal bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction where C is something like CaC2O4 (calcium oxalate). When it reacts with water, it might not hydrolyze. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another angle: the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Let's think about what produces two different acids upon hydrolysis. One possibility is a salt of a diprotic acid where one of the conjugate bases is weak and the other is strong. Wait, but in that case, maybe the salt would be something like NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and another acid? Not exactly.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Wait, no, because that would produce ammonia and a strong base, not acids.

Another thought: maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with water to produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2, which is a base (but not an acid). So that wouldn't give both F and G as acids.

Wait, what about a carbonate? If C is a carbonate of a metal, like Na2CO3, then in water, it can hydrolyze slightly into HCO3^- and OH^- (producing a weak acid, H2CO3), but that's only one acid.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about D and B first. Since D is hydrogen gas and B is oxygen, as per earlier reasoning, because they form H2O, a solvent. So, D is H2, B is O2.

So, reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C. So, what solid A reacts with O2 in an 8:1 ratio? Let me think of metals. Wait, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form SO3. Let me check the reaction: S(s) + O2(g) → SO3(g). Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1 S : 3 O2. So, for 1 mole of S, 3/2 moles of O2? No, wait, the balanced equation is S + (3/2) O2 → SO3. So 1 mole of S requires 1.5 moles O2. So, that's 3/2 O2 per S. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of O2 per 1 mole of A. So 8 O2 per A. That's a ratio of 8:1.

Wait, could A be Fe? Let's see: FeO is not very stable, but Fe3O4 is. The reaction for Fe3O4 is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe3O4. So per 4 Fe, 3 O2. So per Fe, 3/4 O2. Not 8:1.

Wait, another approach: What if A is a non-metal? Like phosphorus. P4 reacting with O2 forms P4O10. The reaction is P4 + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. So, per P4, 5 O2. So that's 5 O2 per 1 mole of P4 (since 1 mole of P4 is 4 atoms). So for 4 P atoms, 5 O2. So per P atom, 5/4 O2. Not matching the 8:1 ratio.

Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of a reaction where a solid reacts with O2 in a high ratio. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a reaction where a metal reacts with O2 to form a dioxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a carbon compound. For example, maybe it's a sugar, but that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead forms PbO2. The reaction is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So per Pb, 3/2 O2. Not 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is something like sodium, but sodium reacts with O2 to form Na2O or Na2O2. Let me see: For Na2O2, the reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So per 2 Na, 1 O2. So per Na, 0.5 O2. Not 8 equivalents.

Hmm. Maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxide. Let's think: maybe vanadium? Vanadium(IV) oxide, V2O5. The reaction for its formation is 2 V + 5 O2 → 2 V2O5. So, per 2 V atoms, 5 O2. So per V atom, 5/2 O2. So per mole (V), 5/2 O2. That's 2.5 equivalents. Not 8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a trioxide. Let's see, say Al2O3. 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So per Al, 3/4 O2. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about product E. E is formed when C reacts with D (which is H2 gas) in a 2:1 ratio. Wait, the second reaction is C + 2 D → E. Since D is H2, that would be C + 2 H2 → E. What kind of reaction is that?

Wait, maybe C is a trioxide, and adding H2 would reduce it. For example, SO3 + H2 → something. SO3 reacting with H2 could form H2SO4 and H2O, but that's under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form metal and water. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But the ratio would be 1:1, I think.

Wait, another thought: If C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, adding H2 might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Na3N reacts with H2 to form Na and NH3. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form the corresponding metal and water. For example, Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe and H2O. The reaction is Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. So, 4 H2 per 1 Fe3O4. So that's 4 H2 per 1 mole of Fe3O4. The problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to form E. So E would be Fe and H2O in this case. But E is an extremely hazardous product, which might make sense if it's a metal like iron, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then C is Fe3O4. What about the other reactions? Fe3O4 reacting with water: Fe3O4 + 4 H2O → Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, but those are hydroxides, not acids. So that doesn't fit with the reaction giving two acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is something else. Let me think again.

The hydrolysis of C produces A, F, and G, two acids. So, maybe C is a salt of a polyprotic acid. Let's think of a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (a weak acid) and HSO3^- (which could further dissociate, but I'm not sure if that's an acid). Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate, but that might not split into two acids.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, but sulfates typically hydrolyze to give H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But that would only produce one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (a base). So that's one acid and one base, which doesn't fit because both F and G are acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (base). Again, only one acid and one base, but the question says two acids.

Another thought: What if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH. Again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrite, NaNO2. Reacting with water might not form an acid, but perhaps under certain conditions it can hydrolyze, but I don't recall that producing an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different type of salt. Let's think of a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. For example, something like Mg(OH)2SO4, but that's not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixed salt.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal carbonate, but that's not working. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into HCO3^- and Na^+; but that doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, Na3PO4. Reacting with water: Na3PO4 + H2O → Na2HPO4 + NaOH. So, H3PO4 is a weak acid, but I don't see two acids here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me try another angle. The first reaction is A (solid) + 8 O2 → C. What if A is a metal that forms an oxide with a high ratio of O2? Let me think: Perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with formula MO3, which would require more O2 per metal atom. For example, let's say A is molybdenum (Mo). Mo can form MoO3. The reaction would be Mo + 3 O2 → MoO3. So, per mole of Mo, 3 O2. Not 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. S + O2 → SO3. The reaction uses 3/2 O2 per S. So 3/2 O2 per mole of S. Not 8.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with a higher oxygen ratio, like OsO4, but that's not a solid perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal that forms an oxide with a higher oxygen count. For example, lead forms PbO2. The reaction is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So 3/2 O2 per Pb. Again, not 8.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with a high ratio but in a different stoichiometry. Let me think of Ti. Ti can form TiO2. The reaction is 4 Ti + 3 O2 → 2 TiO2. So 3/4 O2 per Ti. Not 8.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me think about the reaction C + 2 H2 → E. What if E is water? No, because H2 is a reactant. Alternatively, maybe E is something like NH3, but that would require N in C.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about E being a highly hazardous product. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? For example, HCN, but that's a gas. Or perhaps something like sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound, like ozone (but that's O3, which is a gas and not produced from C + H2). Alternatively, maybe E is a toxic gas like HCl, but that would require Cl in C.

Wait, but earlier I thought D is H2 and B is O2. So, in the first reaction, A + 8 O2 → C. Maybe C is a compound that reacts with H2 to form something dangerous. Let me think, perhaps C is SO3. Then, SO3 + H2 → something. But under what conditions? Maybe it's a reduction reaction. SO3 + H2 → H2SO4? But that would require a catalyst and perhaps high temperatures. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form H2S, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: If C is Fe3O4 (magnetite), then reacting with H2 would produce Fe and H2O. Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. So, 4 H2 per Fe3O4. But the problem states that 2 equivalents of D (H2) are used. So that would be 2 H2 per C. So, maybe C is something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound that when reacted with H2 forms a metal and water. Let's say C is CuO. Then, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. So, 1:1 ratio. But the problem says 2 equivalents of H2, so maybe it's a different oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is PbO2. PbO2 + H2 → Pb + H2O. The reaction is PbO2 + H2 → Pb + H2O. So, 1:1 ratio. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the hydrolysis reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G is weak. So, perhaps C is a salt that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, then it would produce H2SO3 (weak) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). But that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the question says it produces two acids, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, Na2SO4. Reacting with water would not produce any acid, just stay as sulfate and sodium ions. So that's not helpful.

Wait, what about a nitrate? NaNO3 reacts with water, but it doesn't hydrolyze into acid. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: Maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (base). So that's one acid and one base, but the problem says two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a diprotic acid where one of the anions is a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHCO3, then it hydrolyzes into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, only one acid.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a triprotic acid. For example, Na2HPO4. Reacting with water would produce HPO4^2- and NaOH. But that's not two acids.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of C as something that when reacts with H2 forms a dangerous product. Maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But how would that form from A + O2?

Wait, another approach: Let's list possible products E and see what their symmetries are.

The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all molecular symmetry groups. So E must be a molecule with one of these symmetries.

Let me think about some molecules and their symmetry groups.

- H2O (water): has D∞h symmetry. But E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a different compound.

- Ozone (O3) has D3h symmetry.

- NH3 has Td symmetry.

- CH4 has Td symmetry.

- HCN has a linear structure, so its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, the options include D∞h as option C. So if E is HCN, that could fit. But how would E be formed?

Wait, if C is a cyanide salt. Let's think. If C is NaCN, then reacting with H2 (D) would produce HCN and NaOH. But the stoichiometry would be NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. Hmm, but H2 would need to be in a reaction. Or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is CO (carbon monoxide), which is a gas, but in the first reaction, C is a bright red product. Wait, CO is a gas, not a solid.

Wait, another possibility: The bright red product could be Fe2O3·nH2O, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is a bright green solid, but not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a compound that produces HCN when reacted with H2. Let me think: If C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, then reacting with H2 might not produce HCN directly. Alternatively, perhaps C is OCN^- (cyanate), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction C + H2 → E is a hydrogenation reaction. For example, C could be a nitrile, like CH3CN, which upon hydrogenation would form CH3CH2NH2 (which is a primary amine, but that's not a gas and not extremely hazardous). Alternatively, perhaps C is an alkyne that hydrogenates to an alkane, but that doesn't produce a hazardous product.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCl. But in that case, C would have to be Cl-based. Wait, D is H2, so E would be HCl. How? If C contains Cl, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A is a solid, reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. What if A is a metal that forms an oxide with a 8:1 ratio? Let's see: The formula would be MO, but that's not possible because most metals have a valency higher than +1. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal that forms an oxide with a higher valence, like +8? That's unlikely, as most metals have valencies of +1, +2, +3, +4, etc.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with the formula M3O4, which would require O2 in a certain ratio. For example, Fe3O4: 3 Fe + 4 O2 → 2 Fe3O4. So for 3 Fe, 4 O2. So per Fe, (4/3) O2. Not 8 equivalents.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible symmetry groups again. The options are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. Examples include H2O2 (which has a C2 axis), but H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, some molecules like ethylene have C2 symmetry.

B) D4h: This is a point group with a fourfold rotation axis, horizontal mirror planes, etc. Examples include adamantane or perhaps some transition metal complexes.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis. Examples include HCN, CO, and O3 (ozone). Wait, O3 has D3h symmetry, not D∞h. HCN is linear, so D∞h.

D) C2v: This is a point group with a twofold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Examples include H2O (which actually has D2h symmetry, but maybe I'm mixing up).

Wait, H2O has D2h symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Ozone (O3) has D3h. So, if E is O3, that would be D3h, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, another thought: If E is HCN gas, which is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h. So option C would be correct.

But how does HCN fit into the reactions? Let me think. To produce HCN, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Let's see:

If C is NaCN, and it reacts with H2 (D) in a 2:1 ratio. Wait, but what reaction would that be? NaCN + H2 → ?

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO, and H2 is added to CO to form CH3OH (methanol) via the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrile, like CH3CN. Reacting with H2 in the presence of a catalyst could hydrogenate it to CH3CH2NH2, which is a primary amine. But that's not a gas and not extremely hazardous.

Hmm. Another approach: Perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which would have D∞h symmetry. So, the correct answer would be option C.

But how does that fit into the reactions? Let me try to piece it together.

If E is HCN, then the reaction C + 2 H2 → HCN + ...? Maybe C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN. So, NaCN + 2 H2 → HCN + NaH2? That doesn't make sense, as NaH2 is not a stable compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different cyanide. Let's say C is (NH4)CN. Then, (NH4)CN + H2 → HCN + NH3 + H2O. But the stoichiometry might not fit.

Wait, another angle: Let's think that C is a compound that when reacted with H2 produces HCN. For example, C could be CH3CN (acetonitrile), which upon reaction with H2 in the presence of a catalyst (like nickel) could produce CH3CH2NH2 (ethylamine), but that's not HCN.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead focus on the fact that the answer options are symmetry groups, and E is a product that must have one of them.

If E is HCN (which has D∞h symmetry), then the correct option is C.

But I need to confirm if the reactions fit.

Alternatively, if E is a different molecule, like ozone (O3), which has D3h symmetry, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another thought: What about SO2? It has D∞h symmetry because it's a bent molecule with a center of inversion and a twofold axis. Wait, no, SO2 has a V shape, so its point group is D3h. Hmm.

Wait, another gas: Cl2 has a linear structure with D∞h symmetry. If E were Cl2, but then how would it form from C and H2? That doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: E is NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure with Td symmetry, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, E could be H2O, which has D2h symmetry, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: What about O2? O2 has a linear structure, so D∞h symmetry. But E is produced from C and H2, so that would require C to be O2, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or H2, but that's probably not the case since D is H2.

Wait, another angle: The extremely hazardous product E. Highly hazardous products could include things like chlorine gas (Cl2, D∞h), hydrogen cyanide (HCN, D∞h), sarin gas (which is a nerve agent but has a more complex structure), phosgene (which is O=C(Cl)Cl, has a planar structure with D2h symmetry), or something like NO (nitric oxide, which has C2v symmetry).

Wait, NO has a linear structure but with a permanent dipole moment, so its symmetry is D∞h. Wait, no, NO is a linear molecule with a double bond and has a C∞v symmetry, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible symmetry groups and their typical compounds.

- D4h: Examples include methane (but CH4 has Td symmetry), maybe some metal complexes.

- D∞h: Linear molecules like HCN, CO, NO, Cl2.

- C2: Molecules like H2O2, which has a C2 axis, but H2O2 is not a gas. Or some substituted ethenes.

- C2v: Molecules like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry.

So, if E is NO2, which is a reddish-brown gas and highly toxic, then its symmetry group is C2v.

But wait, NO2 is a bent molecule, so C2v symmetry. So if E is NO2, then the answer would be D) C2v.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Let me try to re-express the reactions with this in mind.

Assume E is NO2.

Then, reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → NO2 + ... ?

But H2 reacting with C to form NO2 doesn't make much sense, unless C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, but let's think of C as a compound that when reacted with H2 forms NO2.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrite, like NaNO2. Reacting with H2 would form something else, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe C is a nitrate, like HNO3. Reacting with H2 could produce something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate ester. For example, HNO3 could decompose, but that's not involving H2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, like RNO2, which upon reaction with H2 could reduce to RNH2 (an amine). But again, not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacting with H2 could produce NH3 and Mg. But that would be: Mg3N2 + 3 H2 → 3 Mg + 2 NH3. So, 3 H2 per Mg3N2. But the problem states 2 equivalents of H2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If E is NO2, then perhaps C is NO. But then, NO + H2 would form something else. Let me think: 4 NO + 3 H2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O. But that's a different ratio.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think of another approach.

The fact that C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid) suggests that C is a salt that releases two acids upon hydrolysis. So, perhaps C is a sulfite, carbonate, or something similar. But I can't get it to fit.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is H2SO3. So, C could be a sulfate and sulfite mixed salt. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4. But that would require C to be a chloride and sulfate, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anion salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into HSO4^- and Na^+. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form H2SO4) or a base (accepting H+ to form SO4^2-). But in this case, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and possibly H2O. Not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the information I have. Based on the options, the most likely extremely hazardous product with a D∞h symmetry group is HCN. So, the answer would be option C.

But wait, another possibility: E could be O3 (ozone), but that has D3h symmetry, which isn't an option here.

Alternatively, if E is CO (carbon monoxide), which has D∞h symmetry, but CO is a gas, but not extremely hazardous in the same way as HCN. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl2, but that's a gas and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: If E is a molecule like SO2, which is a bent molecule with a D∞h symmetry. SO2 is a toxic gas, but it's not extremely hazardous. But in terms of symmetry, it would fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought that SO2 is D3h. Let me double-check: SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 120 degrees. The point group is D3h because it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So, D3h, which isn't an option here.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is D∞h, option C, with E being HCN.

But without knowing the exact reactions, it's hard to be certain. Given the options and the reasoning, I think the best fit is that E has D∞h symmetry.

The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the determination of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (identified as O₂) to form bright red product C. This suggests A is likely a solid that reacts with oxygen to form a compound with a high oxygen content. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear due to the lack of a direct match for the 8:1 stoichiometry.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (identified as H₂) to form E, an extremely hazardous product. This implies C undergoes a reaction with hydrogen to form E. The symmetry group of E must be determined.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes into two acids. However, the exact nature of C remains ambiguous.

4. **D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.** Since B is O₂ and D is H₂, H is identified as H₂O, consistent with the formation of water.

5. **Symmetry group of E**: The options provided are:
   - **A) C2**: Twofold rotation axis. Examples include H₂O₂.
   - **B) D₄h**: Fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Examples include adamantane.
   - **C) D∞h**: Linear molecule with infinite twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis. Examples include HCN, CO, and Cl₂.
   - **D) C₂v**: Twofold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Examples include NO₂.

   Based on the description, E is extremely hazardous. HCN (hydrogen cyanide) is a highly toxic gas with linear geometry and D∞h symmetry. This matches option C. Other possibilities, such as O₃ (ozone) or NO₂, do not fit the given options or the description of E.

6. **Conclusion**: The most plausible identity for E, given the symmetry options and the hazardous nature of the product, is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.
